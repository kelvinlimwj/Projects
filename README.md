# Projects Overview

### Project 1: Standardized Testing, Statistical Summaries and Inference 

Description: Aggregate SAT and ACT scores and participation rates from each state in the United States are analysed.
We'll seek to identify trends in the data and combine our data analysis with outside research to identify likely factors influencing participation rates and scores in various states.

Skills/Libraries Used: 
- Python Pandas
- Numpy
- MatplotLib
- Seaborn

### Project 2: Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge (Linear Regression)

Description: Tasked with creating a regression model based on the Ames Housing Dataset. 
This model will predict the price of a house at sale in Ames, Iowa in United States.

Skills/Libraries Used:
- Python Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Feature Engineering
- Feature Selection
- One-Hot-Encoding
- Scikit-Learn - Linear Regression
- Scikit-Learn - Multiple Linear Regression
- Lasso/Ridge/ElasticNet Regression
- Train-Test-Split
- Cross Validation Score

### Project 3: Project 3 1. Classification models using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Classification between two different subreddit posts into their respective subreddits using Natural Language Processing. 

1. Webscraping
2. Data Cleaning
3. Modelling 
  - Created GridSearchCV Function to run various regression models with different word vectorizers for NLP via usage of data pipelines

Skills/Libraries Used: 
- Python Pandas
- Numpy
- MatplotLib
- Seaborn
- NLTK
- Regular Expressions (Regex)
- Logistic Regression
- Grid Search CV (Hyperparameters)
- PipeLine
- API Application for WebScraping (Reddit)
- Decision Tree Models
- Random Forest Models
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### Project 4: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) ###
