t3_dj8mxt,"""The doctors have to take my face off because I have skin cancer""","First-time poster on this sub. This event happened this past Tuesday and I've been debating on whether or not this was a good enough story to post. I figured someone might get a kick out of it so: here you go.

I work at a big name crafts store as a cashier. It was around mid-afternoon so we weren't particularly busy. Weekdays tend to be very quiet with the only big rushes coming in around 12 or after 3. This elderly lady with frizzy white hair comes walking up to my counter with her items and a coupon. Okay, standard stuff. This should be an easy sale.

So I start scanning her items and while I do that I try to start up a conversation. I like to do that. I find it helps pass the time for the customer, plus I just love to hear other people's stories. Well boy howdy did this woman have a doozy.

I wasn't able to remember the exact dialogue but I remember that this was so sudden I almost got whiplash. I'll give you guys a rough summary of how it went.

Me: So, how have you been doing?

Old Lady: Awful. I'm 91 years old so my health is going.

Me: Oh i'm very sorry to hear that. but wow 91 years old that's impressive.

OL: The doctors- The doctors have to take my face off.

Me: O-Oh?

OL: I have cancer. They have to remove my skin. I have skin cancer and \[name of some other medical ailment that i can't remember.\]

Me: That's awful I'm very sorry to-

OL: It makes my leg shake in the night and look at my hand \*shows me her hand\* It makes it so hard for me- it shakes. And they always say ""oh you look fine"" and ""oh you look great"" but they're lying I know they are.

Me: I'm very sorry to hear that ma'am-

OL: I've always had cancer. I keep telling my doctors. But they never find anything. They say it's not there. BUT I KNOW i have cancer!

Me: \*starting to realize she could be mentally ill\* Ah. I see.

OL: I had a tumor in my lip once. It took them two years to get it out because they didn't believe me. And I had- I had cancer behind my stomach. And then I had a blocked \[unintelligable\] that they had to go through my whole intensities and give me a bag to help drain it and- \*she keeps going on about her entire medical history\*

Me: Right- that will be-

OL: I recently signed over my house to my grandchildren- and they say- they say I-

Me: Ma'am, that'll be \[Total amount of purchase\]

OL: Oh right \*puts her card in the machine\*

We finish up the transaction and I'm certain now she's going to say her goodbyes. But no. After I hand her the receipt she goes right back to talking.

OL: - anyway I've had to get 58 surgeries. Oh and look at this.

Then from the depths of her purse, she pulled out a ziplock bag with papers inside, pulled out the papers to reveal that they're just random blurry photos of random parts of her body. A couple of photos of her face. A few of her hands. A few of her feet. They all looked normal but she's pointing out these photos as if they're PROOF that she has cancer.

I think she felt emboldened to keep going because nobody else was there. So there I stood. Looking at blurry photos. I didn't want to seem insensitive and tell her to get lost, but I didn't want her to hinder me doing my duties. I also wasn't sure if she was mentally ill or not. I'm a very empathetic person, especially when it comes to cancer patients. My grandpa passed away due to liver cancer and losing him was painful. Even so, I know she might have been doing this out of fear, and just needed an outlet.

I took her hand and told her, ""Well, you were strong enough to make it this far and I pray that you'll at least be able to find some comfort.""

She laughed as if I had said a joke and then turned to walk away because she noticed another customer coming up to the registers.

It was a really strange and kind of uncomfortable encounter. I do hope that woman is ok though, despite coming off as a little bit crazy.",TalesFromRetail
t3_djb3c9,She thought we worked 24/7,"There was a woman who came in to the store I work at. It was almost Christmas I think, so obviously very busy. The cashiers had to go to the office if they ran out of change, which on that day was happening quite a bit.
Well needless to say, the cashier ran out of change for this woman who paid with cash, and that gave me enough time to finish bagging groceries as this woman has a lot of groceries.

After like a minute the woman looks at me and asks why the cashier just up and left.

""She's going to get change because she ran out.""

Her face was the description of confusion. It was like she was reacting to me talking about quantum physics. She goes, ""Isn't this store open 24 hours?""

""Yes.""

""Then why is she out of cash.""

I was confused at what she meant. Like did she think we worked constantly and like lived at the store or does she think that the 24 hours automatically regenerates cash instantaneously. I don't know, not really something that frusterated me or was annoying, but just a strange thing.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dizq6s,I Want To Hand Pick 60 Cupcakes,"Mobile warning. 

This happened 3 weeks back now. 

I recently started a job at a bakery where we have $1 cupcakes on Tuesdays. 

Now, people will order them ahead of time, having us set them aside and bag them. They give a pick up time and name, all is good. Not everyone knows about this, but hey, they are a buck, so they do it next time. 

As you can imagine, everyone comes in and gets dozens. This day though, was a day. 

At the time, we had about 10 people in our small storefront. There are usually 3 of us to help customers, so we do our best. I call to help whoever is next, and a woman and her daughter walk up. 

The woman starts telling me her life story, but today they are at our bakery to buy 60 cupcakes for a baby shower on the weekend. Okay, no problem. Did you want to get 5 flavors, a dozen each? She struggled with this idea for bit, but finally agreed. This is where it turns. 

She tells me she wants the prettiest cupcakes since it's for a shower. Okay, the best decorated ones, can do. She picks cookies and cream, and I start to fill a dozen. She stops me, and asks me to PULL THE TRAY out of the case and let her INDIVIDUALLY choose each cupcake for each dozen. Her daughter gets embarrassed instantly. I kind of stared at her for a second til she asked again. As if there weren't 7 people behind her wanting cupcakes as well. So there I am, forced to pull the tray out while she picks 12 cupcakes from throughout the whole tray. People around her are kind of staring, and her daughter had tried to say something but she ignored it. 

It took 15 minutes to get them all. It was insane. My coworker helped her check out and he kind of bluntly told her that she needs to order next time, especially if it's for such an important event like a shower. 

Don't be so sucky and cheap, especially if it's for an event.

Edit: Something I had forgotten about this interaction til the morning was she asked me to get 30 of the leaf rings we had on the funfetti rings because they were ""so cute"" and they all HAD to match. We didn't charge her for them either.

Edit 2: someone kindly pointed out a spelling mistake and then deleted their comment. Thanks???",TalesFromRetail
t3_dj5k7s,The first time ever someone made a complaint about me,"I work at a privately owned builder's store that sells everything from tools to lumber, basically anything you need for building. My main job used to be on the lumber side (showing people where certain products are, helping them load their purchases and writing receipts for checkout) and this is where today's story is set. Ahem...

It was my second year and a hot summer day. This couple drives to the yard and asks for our cheapest impregnated boards. We were running a promotion on last year's boards (a bit grayed in the sun, nothing major) and this was what they wanted. Being the usual picky customers I was already well used to they wanted to hand pick every single board. Mind you that they were taking enough to build an entire deck so this was a crapload. And by ""hand pick"" I mean they checked every board from every angle so that they were absolutely perfect (yet you came here for the cheapest). After twirling a board for what felt like an eternity they immediately threw it on their trailer. I have no idea how long this took, I zoned out quite fast while standing there waiting for an opportunity to write their receipt. Usually I ask what a customer's quota is and give them their receipt based on that, especially if it's busy so I can move on to other customers, and check their load once they're finished if I can. They ""didn't yet know how many they need"" (people usually do, I have no idea why some feel like making me stand around) and it wasn't terribly busy so I just kinda hung around while they did their thing. They finish up, I thank them for their patronage, give them their receipt and move on with my day.

Now, a couple of days later, word got out that someone had had a complaint made of them but by who, when and where remained a mystery. All we knew was that this person had complained about terrible service and how this salesperson had ""just stood there and not helped with loading their trailer whatsoever"". For a while we thought this salesperson had been one of our younger summer workers. Finally, when we found out who had made the complaint, it clicked and I outed myself as this terrible person ""refusing"" to help. I mean, what was I even supposed to do? Had I put anything in the trailer that they had not approved they would've complained. So, what, they wanted me to rip the boards from their hands and throw them on the trailer before they could? ""Ah yes, you are clearly far to weak and frail to put this board on the trailer that is literally right next to you. Let me.""

t3_djaiss,Soup Story,"**Soup Story**

I am the front-end manager in this story. I received a call that a customer wanted to speak to management at the customer service desk. As I walked to the service desk, I saw an elderly lady with a cart full of soup. I set my mind for a variety of requests such as a large return, request for bulk discount, forced tax exemption verification, and the list just kept getting larger. I greeted the customer and asked what I can help her with today. 

Lady: It’s what I did for you today.

Me: \*confused\* Oh? 

Lady: I was in the soup aisle shopping and saw these soups… \*points to cart\*

Me: Was it in the wrong location? 

Lady: No… they were all open!

Me: I apologize, did you want me to run to the back and find you some that are still intact?

Lady: I don’t know how a company would sell opened items!

Me: Well, we don’t sell open food containers however we cannot control customers who may have opened the containers.

Lady: I doubt a customer would open these soups and just leave them on the self, you must have taken it back as a return and placed it on the self. \*points to me\*

Me: All returned food items are sent back to claims and processed out. We do not restock food once it leaves the building even if it seems like a brand-new package. 

Lady: Then what is your excuses with these soups! \*steps towards me\*

Me: Well, as I stated we can not control the actions of the customer, but I will deal with this problem. 

Lady: Prove it! \*folds arms\*

Me: Sure… \*walks to the soup cart\*

Lady: \*starts tapping her feet\*

Me: \*Grabs two soup containers and returns to customer\* 

Lady: Their ALL open!

Me: Well mam, this one is closed because the cap is still intact. \*hold up left hand\* However you are correct that there are many that are open because the others have unattached caps \*hold up right hand\*.

Lady: Their all open! I opened them and checked!

Me: … yes, so they have a self-opening cap so once you turn the cap it breaks the seal inside.

Lady: What?

Me: When you turn the cap it breaks the inside seal.

Lady: …

Me: So, like I was saying earlier, we can not control customers and do not sell open products. I will take out the broken sealed containers and have the service desk claim then out and I will personally restock the unopened containers back to the sales floor. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

The customer apologized profusely and I’m sure was embarrassed because she started drawing the attention of everyone in the customer service line and passing customers with her mannerisms.",TalesFromRetail
t3_djar32,The russian box,"I work in a retail store and we sell suitcases, bags and travel accessories.

A man came in and wanted to buy a cabin sized type of bag. I helped the man, and I sold him an expensive dufflebag with wheels.
He came back like 10 minutes later after he had left my store, and needed to return the duffle bag and find something else because a box he now carried with him didn't fit in the duffle bag. So we used like 30 minutes to find a bag that would fit his box.
It wasn't a big box, but it was a little heavy. So in the cash register when I was doing the return, he said "" I traveled here to meet a friend and do some business, but he died. That's why I needed this bag. I'm flying him home to Russia in this box"". AND HE POINTED TO THE BOX WE JUST TRIED TO FIT INTO EVERYTHING IN MY STORE! 
I had to maintain professional, so I answered "" Oh I'm so sorry for your loss! I hope you two have a safe flight to Russia.""",TalesFromRetail
t3_dih50e,You never know who you meet working,"This story was from 14 years ago back on Long Island &amp; doesn't involve anyone being rude or nasty, so if that's what you came here for, sorry to disappoint.

I was working at my register around Thanksgiving/Christmas time, when a nice older lady came up to my register and we had a brief conversation about how the holidays bring out the best in people (which they do if you don't count the maniacs shopping). Then the topic of how everyone should be thankful for what they have and we should never take a minute later for granted.

She then surprised me with ""I know probably better than anyone the truth of that."" Not sure how many of you know, but the year before (2004) she became famous for being the victim of teenagers throwing frozen turkeys out of there car into oncoming traffic going the other way. It hit her car, broke through the window, bent the steering wheel before hitting and basically destroyed her face (Google it if you think I'm kidding).  Needless to say that I was in shock because she healed to the point you couldn't tell that nearly every bone in her face was shattered, her jaw wired shut and was living off a feeding tube just a year prior. I told her that after hearing the story, I was happy to see how well she recovered.

I then asked her if they ever found the kids who did it. She said she did and she asked the judge to go easy on them as she forgave them. I instantly remember hearing that in the paper and I told her ""You are a much better person than I could ever be, because I don't think I would be as forgiving if that was me."" She appreciated me honesty &amp; understood where I was coming from as I'm sure others have said something similar.

OP is me

D which stands Dummy

Backstory

Hurricane Harvey was devastating to many areas and I , who lives in southern Texas, was somehow only mildly affected.  Other aspects of my life weren't.  I can say the store ,which will call Toad Town Grocery, I worked at was most definitely affected.  Beside the fact that we couldn't get anymore product than what we had left means that when we finally open our doors after closing due to floods, people stormed us.  We were low or out of everything.  You name it milk, bread, water, canned goods, diapers, etc.  One thing that was also affect was people's intelligence.  Due to the panic of all this people couldn't think straight or in this case hear straight.  Since stores were closing early due to the rain still threatening to flood, we were getting phone calls to the store like crazy.  They all asked the same question.  ""Are you open?""  Since we had so many calls coming through it was impossible to answer the phone and work at the same time with lines longer than all tarnation.  My usual greeting over the phone was ""Toad Town Grocery on Mushroom Kingdom St!  This is OP!  How can I help you!"".  But since we had so many calls about the same thing I tacked this on to the phrase and it sped things up.  ""Toad Town Grocery on Mushroom Kingdom St! This is OP!  How can I help you!  And before you ask, we are open 'til eleven.

Here's the story

Remember when I said people ""Due to the panic of all this people couldn't think straight or in this case hear straight?""  I get a call and start my phone greeting.

OP: Toad Town Grocery on Mushroom Kingdom St!!  This Op How can I help you!  And before you ask we are open 'til eleven!

D: YOU GUYS OPEN! (yes she's shouting)

OP: (I pause for a moment) We are open 'til eleven!

D: WHAT TIME YOU CLOSE!

OP: (I pause again) Eleven....

t3_dig9y9,A reunion with the man who threatened to kill me,"I found out about this sub recently, and I have many retail stories to share, so this will mark the first I suppose.

Over the summer, I worked at a drugstore out on Long Island. I bike everywhere, and to get to the store, I had to take one of two major roads. One of the roads was bigger and had a faster speed limit, and it makes me uncomfortable to have so many cars whizzing by me. I normally choose the smaller road, which (in theory) has a slower speed limit, but because the road has less traffic, people go at whatever speed they want because the traffic cops mainly stick to the big road. Another obstacle on this smaller road is that it is very close to the beach, so there will often be large patches of sand on the side of the road, which is especially dangerous for cyclists.

I was biking to work one morning and I had to go a bit into the road to avoid one of the patches of sand, and was surprised when I heard a loud car horn right behind me. A split second later, a red minivan whizzed around me, going well above the speed limit. I was annoyed by their lack of decorum, so I theatrically flipped them off with both arms. To my surprise, the car stopped until I came alongside it. Sitting in the driver’s seat was an older man not wearing a shirt. As I passed him he accelerated, trying to run me off the road, coming alongside me and then swerving towards me, while screaming about how he was going to beat me up and kill me. I ignored him as best I could, dodging his car with little difficulty as there was a small grassy incline that I stayed on top of, and he eventually gave up and drove off. I arrived at work with no further incident. I mainly forgot the details of the incident a while later.

A few days after, I was checking out an older gentleman at the store, and we started a small conversation, and it was very nice. I wished him a nice day, and he left. Over the next few weeks, he came in every couple of days to pick up groceries and the like. Each time, we had a small conversation. One day, our conversation drifted over to the roads and traffic, and he mentioned that he always drives on the road that I bike on. I mention that I always use that road to get to work as well, and then I mention that sometimes drivers can be a bit aggressive on that road, mentioning that I had an incident a couple of weeks ago. As I say this and I’m looking at him, something clicks, and I realize that this man who I’ve enjoyed talking to these last few weeks is the SAME GUY who threatened to kill me all those weeks ago. He realizes the same thing, and we stare at each other in silence for a few moments before his transaction goes through and he abruptly leaves the store. I never saw him again.",TalesFromRetail

We just recently put self check outs in, so I'm used to getting a lot of questions about it. This older woman walks up, big glasses and gray hair that looked like it was also trying to get away from her.

&gt;""Yes they do, ma'am!""

t3_di8l18,A customer freaks out over getting popcorn for the right price,"I work as a keyholder at a grocery store. For the most part, the customers that I interact with are rather pleasant or neutral, but every once in a while some sour fuckers come out of the woodwork. 

It's a somewhat busy day and I'm running the front end by myself so I'm being more lenient just so things go more smoothly. I see a light blinking and I go over to investigate. The cashier tells me that there are two bags of popcorn ringing up incorrectly according to the customer. The bags of popcorn were ringing up as I believe $2.00 but were supposed to be 2 for $3.00, or $1.50 each. I remember something very similar happened a couple days ago, so I give the customer the benefit of the doubt and I immediately change the price without even looking through the weekly flyer or looking at the tags of the shelf.

We got to the point that with these regulars we'll flat out deny having the game they want to buy back to keep them from fucking up our profits/inventory any more than they already are, and we've had regulars come into our store and complain that they went to another store in another city and discovered their account had been frozen/banned for abusing the store policy.  For some reason they think we'll magically be able to free their account or like their account will work in our store for... reasons.

Any rate just the other day a dude tried to return is XB1 controller simply because his son didn't like it.  His son had been playing with for at least a week and since he bought it NEW and then PLAYED with it the controller had officially gone from new to used.  The dude kept insisting that even though it was in fact used he should get a full refund as if it were new because.  ""Well, I come here a lot and I've spent a lot of money here.""

Dude...  EVERYONE comes to this store a lot!  They also spend a lot of money since games, consoles and controllers are expensive!  Why should you be above the return policy?  The controller worked fine and played fine, your brat of a kid just didn't like it for a reason eh couldn't give us.

The manage did take it back but laid it on thick letting him know that he was going to have to defect it out, which means we lost profit and now the whole store is hurting.  He also told him that it was going to be the one and only time, and if he tries it again he'll be barred from the store.

I honestly doubt we can bar him from the store over one controller, but it sounded convincing enough that the dude essentially paled and agreed to not try to do it again.

Couple of days passes before they return to the store carrying a very clearly used console, and I’m guessing this thing has become faulty due to the lack of oxygen in their tobacco fogged home...

t3_dhys2i,Crazy lady breaks in managers' meeting," 

I've worked in a sporting goods store for a little over two years now.

Well, today this woman stops me and gets my attention. I ask her what she needs help with. She explains that she needs 2 bikes and we only have one built and she needs another. So she asks when another can be built. I said it won't be until tomorrow morning because that's when our builders come. My coworker comes up from behind me and verifies this.

She shows us the bike and says, ""It's just a kid's bike. You can build that now really quick, right?""

I explain that it's not up to us. For liability reasons we can't build anything and have to leave it up to our builders.

She explains that she NEEDS it today because her husband ran over her grandkids' bikes and they're coming over later today, so she needs to replace them. I explain again, there is no way that I can build them. Simple or not, if something goes wrong, we can be held liable and I can get in trouble or even fired no matter how good a job I do simply for putting us at risk. She, of course, asks to speak to a manager. I tell her they're all in a meeting, which they are. So she asks where they're at and starts going down the hall to the offices. Me and my coworker just stare at each other in silence. She keeps asking so eventually my coworker says ""They're in that room there."" and points to it. She knocks on the door.

The managers turn to look confused as this woman throws the door open. She explains the situation to literally every lead and manager in the store and, of course they say the exact same thing that I had just said.

This woman begins SCREAMING. ""I'm boycotting this store! Me and my family will never shop here again!"" She says she's gonna post about us on Facebook and stuff.

Edit that basically is the ending the lady took off while i was on the phone no cops showed up. I have no clue if she got arrested or not.",TalesFromRetail
t3_di2n3q,Tmi from a customer,"So, this is a bit different from the other stories I see on here but, here goes nothing. So i work at this clothing store as a sales floor associate (ya know, the guys who walk around picking up after customers). However, occasionally I'll be called to the registers as a backup cashier if the lines get too long. Now, because we're located in a mall we get pretty busy sometimes. This was one of those times.

 I got called up to register, had been up there for roughly 30 minutes already. Then this lady and who I assume were her son's came up to my register. They only had a handful of items. As I'm ringing them up and taking off security tags, the lady says she doesn't want one of the soaps she had. Nbd,  I remove the soap and continue with what i was doing. 

Then I hear the lady say that ""he doesn't need it anyway it's only gonna make him break out."" (I figure she's talking about her husband or boyfriend). Then one of her son's say ""what he needs is some soap for his feet. Have you seen them?"". I chuckle a little thinking, ""I feel ya kid my dad has wierd feet too"". The lady then says, and I quote ""it doesn't matter, I suck his toes anyway."" At this point I'm just trying not to break out into laughter.

She starts laughing, both her son's are laughing, and I'm having a hard time keeping a straight face (and failing). The younger son (the one who made the initial comment about the feet) goes and says ""yo, I know you heard that"" all while still laughing. Me, finally succumbing to laughter say ""nah bro, I didn't hear anything"". I finish the transaction, give them their items, ect, and go back to the floor. The day ends, same old same old and I go home. 

Anyway, nothing bad happened. I just found it funny and wanted to share. Hope you liked it.",TalesFromRetail
t3_di1cr8,Help me find my drugs in your dumpster,"My first job was at a smoothie place that also sold a lot of smoothie related retail items. It was small, and not too busy so shifts would either just be me, or with one other person. This time it was two of us. This guy came in to use our bathroom, but left without getting anything. Not something I was ever bothered by, so I didn’t really think about it. He came back right as we were closing and went back into the bathroom. He came out and kind of frantically asked if we’d taken the trash out. I told him yeah because we’d done just about the entire closing routine at that point. He asked to take me to the dumpster. This guy was pretty big, kind of sketchy looking thug type. He sounded like he was in a hurry too. I’d spent a lot of my youth in the streets doing all sorts of things, some of them questionable. I see a guy like this, and I understand them. He’s just on one of his daily adventures that’s taking him wherever his mishaps lead him. He’s not really thinking, he’s just doing. These sort of people I feel more comfortable around than the other customers who want to come in and talk about the weather. So I take him to our dumpster. I ignore my coworker looking frightened. 

The dumpster is in a garage type room that you need a password to get into, so I was just in there alone with him. I ask him what it looks like he’s looking for, and he said a Swisher wrapper wrapped in a paper towel. In high school we always kept weed in swisher wrappers after using them for blunts, so I asked him if he was looking for weed. He didn’t look at me, and just said yeah real plainly. I immediately knew it wasn’t weed he was looking for, and felt slightly less comfortable. I open the dumpster for him, and literally the entire thing is filled with clear trash bags filled with paper towels. That’s mostly what we threw out on a daily basis, just tons of paper towels because we had to wash our hands after everything we did in front of customers, and in the bathroom all people threw away were paper towels. All I could think was “Good luck finding it,” after seeing what it looked like. He started tearing open the bags, and just going through paper towel after paper towel. He was somehow making a mess in a dumpster. He’d tear open a new trash bag and rummage through each paper towel, and then move to the next one. He was looking for a needle in a haystack. I was going to let him entertain himself for a couple minutes, but I had to get back to closing. Then out of the blue after a good few minutes of nonstop rummaging, he found it. I was actually in disbelief, but I should’ve never doubted that crackhead mentality. I lead him out, and I still to this day am amazed that he walked out of there successful. As we walk out I see my coworker approaching with a phone to her ear looking terrified, and saying she was so worried. I ignore her and watch the man disappear into the night, walking away to another misadventure. And that’s how I helped some guy find drugs out of a dumpster.

If people are rude, we are encouraged to tell them off in whatever flavor we choose. This doesn't mean we cuss people out, but if people approach asking for drugs we can tell them to [redacted] right off. Despite this, we strive to be clean and professional. 

 A lot of our customers are older and use CBD for aches, pains, and other issues. It's a slow day and my tasks today are done so I am twiddling my thumbs and staring at the clock. An older woman enters and begins possibly the most frustrating experience I've had at work in months.

Me: ""Hey there, how are ya doing today?"" 

Lady: ""I'm well, I wanted to see the prices on your CBD oils.""

Me: ""Our CBD oils are in this case here, we have sublingual and vape liquid here. Feel free to ask any questions."" 

Lady: ""How much is this one here?"" She is pointing at one of our strongest doses of premium oil, which retails at $190, and we have for $170.

Me: ""That bottle is $170, we have the same dose from another brand for $100 as well. We typically price match brands, but we are cheaper than [brand] by $20 on that dosage.""

Me: ""No, you don't. That brand is-""

Lady: ""I do!"" She laughs a bit manically, ""It is the same brand and dose.""

Lady: ""This is robbery. You are a crook!"" 

Me: ""We are a licensed distributor and are cheaper than buying directly from the company. We are under retail.""

Lady: ""I'm not paying that much, if you price match then match my shop's price and sell it to me for $20!"" 

Me: ""Absolutely not. I didn't say we price match stores. I said we typically price match the brands, and are often cheaper depending on the brand.""

t3_di1ejx,We were her personal servants and this was her closet,"About 8 years ago, I worked in customer service at Burlington coat factory. I really enjoyed the job and didn't have many run ins with the Karen types, but there was this one old lady who made an impression on me. 

As soon as we opened lay-away for the holidays, she would start treating our store like her personal closet, and we were her servants. 

She would come to the counter with a full cart to be put in lay-away, then ask for all the items she put in there already to be brought out and layed across the counter so she could see everything and decide what she wanted to buy that day. 

She came in every single day, accumulating piles and piles of items in lay-away that we would then have to lug in and out every day for her to look over and choose from. She had her own shelf in the back. That's how much stuff she had. 

I was told she could get snippity if a person acted annoyed, but I never got to see it because often I was already busy with another customer when she arrived, so I never got to the point of being annoyed. Just intrigued.

t3_di1010,Made me smile 😊,"So this is where I provide the obligatory apology for being on mobile after a long day at both class and work, and also because this happened to me a few weeks ago.

I work in a hardware store. I was ringing up a father and his child when I go to interact with the kid like I always do. I go to ask him how old he was, and this cute little guy says in the happiest way he could that he was about to be four. This is where dad chimes in and says, “no you’re about to turn three”. Kid I’m pretty sure was just like,”yeah!”.

t3_dhzjz6,Two stories in one,"So today, we had some... interesting people. First things first: a very irate lady who claims I was out to hurt her and her child.     

This woman, while leaving the store, sees a friend of hers and stops to chit-chat. Right there in the doorway. I’m helping a customer out to her car, and needless to say the door lady was in the way. The woman I’m helping does not give a single fuck and just pushes her way through, and the door lady moves to the side. Still in the door, but just enough room for me to get through. I go through, and after getting through, door lady slams me in the heel with her cart. I turned back, gave her the stink eye, and go on with my job. The customer I was helping was not very happy with that lady and we both exchanged words about it, she even asked if I was ok. Nice lady.      

I’m headed back into the building when the door lady, who’s roaming the parking lot apparently looking for me, stops me, demands my name, and starts yelling that she’s gonna report me. I must have bumped into her or something and she thought I was purposefully trying to shove her around. She even attempts to bring who I assume is her husband into the fray. I’m trying to keep this from causing a scene and now that I’ve got a burly dude staring at me and a loud, angry woman yelling at me, I’m uncomfortable and immediately suggest we both go inside and talk it out with my manager. This pisses her off even more. We go in, and she starts ranting to the guy at the front desk that I purposefully hit her and her kid. She fully acknowledges that she’s blocking the door but apparently doesn’t see anything wrong with blocking one of our 2 doors because she just HAD to talk to her friend. She’s demanding everything, our store number, corporate’s number, the manager. She’s also pissed off at the lady I was helping. Finally we meet with the manager, she tells her side of the story and storms off. Me and the manager go to the back, and try to review the security cameras (useless, they were too fuzzy to see and one of them wasn’t angled right). Lady comes back in, apparently dragged her kids out of the car, and then says the fattest lie I’ve ever heard a customer say: she claims I was smirking at her when I suggested we talk with the manager. All the while the poor kids look like they just want to go home. So I had to write up a report, some poor corporate phone guy is gonna get an earful, and half an hour has been wasted.     

An hour later, another pissed off person is here, cursing out our entire pharmacy while they threaten to call the cops. No idea what that was about, but everyone noticed it. Luckily he left, and he’ll probably end up banned from the store. Weird day.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dhoh5a,Vague threat over £0.40,"This story occurred last night.

So I had been put onto the late shift (3pm-11pm) to cover for a shift manager being away to celebrate his birthday, 

The shift was going really well up until this one incident around 8:30. This man and his kid come up to the till to buy some general bits. As I finish scanning everything, he says “Mate, that price isn’t right, I want to see a receipt”. I then inform him that to see a receipt he first needs to pay for the goods. This is around the time I first started to sense something was up.

He then reluctantly paid for his items and grabbed the receipt off of me. He intensely stared at it before saying “Mate that sausage roll ain’t £1.40, the label says a £1”, “I ain’t paying an extra 40p for that”. He then says “I had to check the receipt as this happens all the time here” which it does since we can’t always update a label as soon as a price changes.

He then delivers the line that genuinely struck a bit of fear into me, “Mate I’ve been arrested before over an incident like this”. My brain starts thinking “What on Earth do you mean by that?” so to avoid a potential incident with him, I went over to check the label myself which indeed did say it was £1 so I gave a refund and put it through at the new price. He then went on his merry way, leaving me confused and to be honest, a little bit worried.

Speaking to my shift manager afterwards, he said he saw them down the isle he was tidying up and got weird vibes about them, but weirdly, more about the kid than the dad.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dhobdv,The time a couple tried to steal $2300 worth of items and only pay $7,"I've never posted on reddit, only got an acc a couple of mins ago, but I work in retail and my god do I have stories to tell. 

I'll kick it off with the time a couple came into our store and filled a 4-drawer plastic shelf (around $7) with all these items from around the store. They cut off the spider-wrap from a lot of our high priced tech items, filled baskets full of hard drives, paints, headphones, etc but did this all pretty discreetly. It was clearly an organised operation. 

When we scan the bigger items (like the shelf) we don't usually lift it onto the counter, just lean over and scan so it would have been impossible for the employee checking out to notice the hidden stock.  Luckily one of the employees caught on and upon discovering the couples' shelf filled to the brim with all their loot, the duo got spooked and left the store. After watching the whole thing on the security tapes, we were curious to see how much they intended to steal and rang up around $2300 of tech items and stationary. We've printed out a pic of them in a heart and it's currently stuck under our counters so that we may never forget these bold souls. I mean I can laugh about it now, but if they truly did get away with it, it would have been real bad...",TalesFromRetail

So they all come in, Tom closest to the door, me getting used to the cash registers and they start talking to him, flirting kind of, I brush it off, he is cute. He goes to help out a customer while I check someone out (cash register) and after I'm done K1 and K2 walk up to me asking me if I've seen their mom, I asked them to describe her so they do and then she appears behind them, they walk away a few feet and I think nothing of it, then she asks if she can use the bathroom after she asks K1 ""really K1, again? You just went""

I know the struggle with my own little brother so I say yes, but by this time Tom comes back and he says it's not a public bathroom, but because I already said yes to show them the way, I brush this off as my mistake as the bathroom is really close to the back room and I've should have known it was not public, but I used it before even before I was an employee. I took K1, K2, and CW1 to the bathroom, then CW2 came along I thought nothing of it maybe she was worried about that she couldn't find them.

Then after I leave a few minutes the bathroom area after all of them leave the bathroom area. Tom calls me over and tells me he's suspicious of them so he's going to watch them and I'm going to cover the registers. He comes back over to the cash registers and looks at the cameras and it confirmed that they were stealing inventory, but Tom deterred them and they left empty handed.

1.)  Me, M1=Manager, M2= the more experienced manager, L=Lady

Customer needs to return a shirt she ordered, washed once, developed a large hole on the seam (yes, I know it happens esp. with this fabric).  She keeps talking.... I mean, TALKING, and talking.  100 words for every 2 necessary and asking if I'm putting this back on her card so she can reorder.  I keep telling her yes.  I tell her everything before, and as I'm doing it.  We get to this point:

&lt;Her store card is declined for insufficient funds&gt; 

L:  Oh, I was afraid that would happen!  I knew I was near the limit.  Can you reverse the return?

Me: I've never heard of such a thing.  I'll get M1.

M1:  Ummmmmmmmmmmm.........

L:  Just get M2, I know she's done it for me before.

30 minutes on the phone to get it reversed, they up her credit limit a bit, reorders the shirt, and she leaves with this weird look on her face.  She did not (for some reason) bring any other cards with her.  I asked M2 later why they not only did that once for her, but why they kept doing it if she couldn't keep her head straight and pay off the bill, or bring her cards with her.  Of course, she's been a long time customer and buys a lot, blah blah blah.  Great start to my very long shift!

CL:  That's the wrong email.

Me:  Ok, hit no and I can update it.  (it's her first and last name at [yadayada.com](https://yadayada.com))

CL:  YOU SPELLED MY NAME WRONG IN THE EMAIL ADDRESS!  (heavy sigh)

Me:  I spelled it the way your name is shown as first and last in the first part of the account.  How is it supposed to be spelled?

CL:  (tells me).

Me:  Ok, verify it's correct again.

Me:  All 4 tables, these 3 are x for $xx mix and match.  This table is 4 for $xx.

L:  Ok, I don't want to get cotton.

Me:  Alright, then you'll be looking at this table.

L:  How much are they?  (looking at the sign)

Me:  They're x for $xx.

L:  Which ones are hipsters?

I showed her the two small sections which are a different feel, but kinda the same.

Meanwhile, I have two people hanging out of the dressing room asking for my help.  I leave to see what they need.  I come back a few minutes later on my way to pull something for one of them.  L drags me back in.

L:  Ok, so which ones are hipsters?  These?

Me:  (Showing her the two again, and where to find the style on the tag).

L:  And what's the sale again?

Me:  x for $xx, these 3 tables.

L:  Which ones were cotton?

Me:  This table.

L:  I don't want cotton.

Me:  (Sighs and scratches my head).

I'm very busy trying to get the item back to the customer in the fitting room.  I get back to the register and turn around to see she's been following me to ask more questions.  I'm trying to ring people up, and she just wonders back to the table, looks at the panties, the sign again, then looks up lost.  This is in the span now of 15 minutes.  She goes into the dressing room with her granddaughter.  I don't see her for another 20 minutes.  Things are still crazy when I'm helping 2 more customers each with a bra.  L comes up asking the same questions and wants me to help pick her out 2 more.  I tell her it'll be a minute because I'm with 2 people in this section.  Wonders back again, circles the table, picks up random pairs, then asks me again where the hipsters were.  I finally just pull two pairs, ask her if she likes the color, and end the misery.  

Her granddaughter checks out with everything, and they leave.  When everyone is gone, M2 tells us L had her trying to fit a bra.

I'm confused and shocked, but thinks she speaks a foreign language (we have a lot of people from outside the US who have trouble speaking English that come to our store) and ask politely ""Yeah, can I help you? I saw the socks and was getting to ring it out."" 

Turns out, she was mad because she wasn't buying the socks and apparently they were already bought. I apologized for acting on instinct, but she didn't forgive me. Usually customers understand and will reply ""Oh, I've already purchased this, sorry about that"" and both them and I will move on to what they need to have done. 

She wanted to pay her credit card balance, and I try to maintain my happy, polite composure to help her. I have her swipe her card so we can pay it off.

However, she is baffled by this and tells me she doesn't want me serving her anymore and asks for my coworker to check her out.

A lady came in one day to shop for an upright freezer and was heading towards the back to our appliance section. We have a smaller store so there are maybe 4 of us working there at most, each of us covering all sections as needed. Now, oddly enough my main position there is as the lone sales rep for our small section for cellular mobilty sales and rate plans, while helping customers in the other areas when I'm not busy. I didn't have any customers in my section so went to see if I could help this lady as everyone else was busy. 

I approached her with my warmest smile and asked if I could help her out with anything. She explained to me that she was looking for a deep freezer. I ask alot of questions. Not just to make sure I get a good idea of what the customer needs in terms of space, functionality, features, etc., but also out of interest and to build rapport. After a few questions we had narrowed it down to an upright freezer style. Cool! Alright, next is to determine the capacity she needs. 

The conversation continues something like this: 

Me: Alright, so as far as upright freezers go, there are a few sizes (cubic foot capacity) available. Tell me, what do you plan on storing in there regularly?

Customer: Excuse me?

Me: I'd like to know what you plan to use it for?

Customer: (*frowny, puzzled face look*)  Is that any of your business? 

Me: (*confused af, similar expression to match painted on my face*) Sorry?

Customer: Why do you need to know what I'm going to put in there? 

Me: (*lightbulb moment*) Oohhh, I only ask that to get an idea of the size of freezer that would best match your needs. 

Customer: (*less frowny face, still sour*) Oh ok. 

By this time, my awesome lady colleague noticed I was distressed and came over to help. I gently passed her the reins with a smile of gratitude and immediately walked back to my desk in a complete state of confusion. 

Thinking about this afterwards, I think I may be better off not knowing her answer to my question.

Thanks for sticking through to the end guys, hope you enjoyed!

TL;DR Lady comes in to buy deep freeze. I get aroune to asking her what she was planning on storing in it (to get an idea of what size she needs). She gets defensive and asks why that is any of my business. I walk away after colleague takes over. Decided that maybe it was better not knowing her answer to my question?",TalesFromRetail

He says, ""No, I need it to make ice cream.""

Me: ""Oh, that's down the baking aisle, next to the sugar and flour.""

I thought that was the end of it until he says, ""What was that first thing you said, though?""

He waves me off and just casually says, ""Thanks, I just want to take a look,"" and goes off *in the direction of the outdoor salt.* 

Later on, I was busy dealing with someone else's cart, so I didn't notice the same guy go through the self checkout, but he stops by after he finishes and says, ""Thank you, I got everything I needed.""

t3_dh8fyd,The brazen thief,"My dad and I used to run a homebrew shop here in Dublin Ireland. We knew all our customers as homebrew was a niche buisness, It didn't often attract new trade. Dad was doing some accounting work in the kitchen behind a closed door and I was in the shop, sitting on the chair at the sales desk. A regular customer came in and we were talking for a few minutes. Another man on his own came into the shop and was looking around for a minute. Then he came over to me, had 2 of the most expensive wine kits in his hands, excused himself, and asked  could he push past the other man as he was rushing. The other customer said OK. The guy put the two wine kits on the counter and told me he'd bought them from me a couple of days ago. That rang alarm bells as I didn't recognise him as having been in the shop a few days before, never mind buying anything from me . he added  his wife prefared red wine and he had 2 white wine kits. I offered him an exchange but he wanted a refund. I told him I would have to get my dad as I'm not able to give money back. I went into the kitchen and called dad out. He looked round the shop and smiled at the customer looking for a refund. The customer explained himself again and dad said I'm sorry I can't give refunds without a receipt. The man got very flustered searched his pockets and then he said it might be in his car. He left the shop and left the kits on the counter. Never came back. I asked dad what happened. Dad told me look at the shelf. There were 2 gaps where those wine kits on the counter belonged. My dad was a stickler for keeping the shelves full and had just filled them prior to starting  his accounting work and no customers had come in between dad filling the shelf and the regular customer and the con man did. What we knew happened was the guy saw that I was engaged with the regular customer i was talking to and used him as a distraction so he could get the kits off the shelf and bring them over to the sales desk. I hasten to add the regular customer was a customer of ours for some years and well known to both dad and me. He was not a knowing part of the con. The guy stood to gain about 100 irish pounds (this was in the mid 90s, the euro had not yet been Introduced ) well done my observant dad. Saved us from loosing a good few bob.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dgwoqi,Little Girl Gets Caught Stealing,"Okay this happened yesterday and I thought I’d share the story. It’s not too exciting but it’s the first time I witnessed something like this. 

A little background: I work at a crafts store as a cashier. I started about a month ago and have been only working two-three shifts in a week. Near the cash registers are aisles where we keep magazines, bags of candy, and some colorful kids toys (small stuffed animals, squishy toys, keychains, etc). It’s not uncommon for me to see little kids begging their parents for a treat of some kind or coming up to the counter with one. 

So yesterday I am working at the register at Guest Services counter cashing people out. In line comes two mothers who both speak Spanish to each other and to the four little girls they had with them. The little girls were running around and begging their moms to get them some small toys. The moms were very assertive and gave them firm ‘no’s’ the entire time they were being cashed out. I felt kind of bad for the little girls, but I understood why the moms were so insistent on saying no. These two women were spending over $200, mostly on ribbon! Not to mention that these little girls weren’t behaving very well, running around in circles and whining (I understand little kids are impatient and it was after 7:30 so I can imagine everyone was just tired, too). 

I get the two moms checked out, and they gather the little girls, all with pouty faces, to leave. I’m handing one of the moms the $200 worth of items while the other mom gets down to the level of one of the little girls who was standing behind her. This mom noticed before I did that the girl had a hand up her shirt. She gets to her level and pulls her arm out, revealing a squishy unicorn keychain! The mom puts the unicorn on the counter near her and scolds her daughter in Spanish. I don’t know much Spanish, but I recognized the word ‘policia,’ which was enough for me to understand that she was basically telling her daughter that she’d get in trouble with the police if she stole. 

I applaud that mom for catching her daughter because I probably wouldn’t have noticed at all!",TalesFromRetail
t3_dh68ha,"""Your having a bad day""","Another tale from a craft store, seems to be a theme this weekend. 

This happened yesterday, I'm still perturb by it. I just walked in, I'm at my locker getting my things. This lady and her child ask from the end of the hallway, ""can I ask you a question?"" I let her know im not clocked in yet.  ""Oh it's not about a product"" i wanted to say well I'm still not clocked in and I'm not being payed for this. She asked ""where is the bathroom"" since it's in the same hallway as the lockers and my locker is really close to the bathroom area I just point and say it's right there.

So I close my locker and go into the break room and clock in. I get told do some reshop and that's all I had for my tasks. I get started on that and as I'm putting something back on the shelf, I run into her again. She asked ""do we have a price checker."" We do and it's literally right behind her. I tell her ""yup we have 2 one if them is right behind you"" and I point again. She doesn't turn around and asked again. At this point I just didn't understand why she didn't listen to me. So I repeated myself and pointed again. 

She then said ""you're having bad day."" Not as a question, as a statement. I guess the look on my face on that statement showed some frustration. She then goes on to say ""everyone has bad days it's not your fault, you're just having a bad day."" To which I replied ""I'm not having a bad day(I kind of was because of her), I'm just really focused(which my regulars know that I look really serious sometimes to the point of looking like I'm having a bad day, when I'm focused), I just really want to get this stuff back on the shelves, so the later shifts don't have a much work(which was mostly true, we have had nothing but newbies closing and the store isn't getting properly cleaned or recovered) She said ""you don't have to make excuses just because your having a bad day"" I said ok and just left. I was thinking fluff you betch, stfu gtfo, you didn't leave well enough alone, you kept pushing my buttons. 

So I'm called up to the registers, I'm ringing and I  eventually see her line. The line moves and I have a customer with a medium size purchase about 10 items and she is next. I purposely take my sweet time, run through every spiel, ask about the customers project and have some chit chat, just so I don't have to interact with that lady again. Which worked, my coworker who was our main cashier, ended up taking care of her and checking her out. As she was grabbing her last bag I overhear her tell her daughter see this one too is having a bad day. 

So it was either both of us having a bad day or the little girl having a bad day and the mom was trying to show everyone has bad days. I don't know, it just made me frustrated for a bit. I hope everyone has a great day!!

t3_dh7oap,Keep a safety distance!,"Usual I'm on mobile, not first time poster though. Also, English isn't my first language. 

So, I work in a bookshop and this actually happened in front of me between two customers. One I was just finished ringing up, the other was waiting in line.

The woman I just finished was actually happy with having found what she liked for and super friendly. I did everything as usual, she paid and was just putting her wallet back into her bag. On her arm was a leash and her dog was standing next to her.

Queue the other customer pushing past her to pay for her stuff and handing it to me. Nothing unusual, we don't have a belt so customers can't just place stuff down while someone else is still being checked out.

Well, I take the stuff, greet her like usual, start scanning her things. The other customer is just closing her bag when the new one snaps at her.

""You should keep a safety distance."" directed at the nice customer's dog.
Keep in mind, she stepped close to the dog. She was the one not keeping her distance.

Well, the other lady had none of that. She snapped back and told that woman off and a small... Let's call it"" discussion"" ensued between them. Until the nice lady took her cute little POMERIAN and walked out.

The other lady now was rude to me. She didn't greet me, didn't say anything at all. I just did my usual stuff, not caring. It was late and she really was not a friendly person. Once she had paid my coworkers came over and asked wtf just happened.

Well, I still don't know. I only know that customers basically got into a fight over one moving close to a fricking pomerian and then telling the owner, who she moved close to, to keep her distance because of her oh so dangerous dog.

Mind you, that dog was adorable and even I, with a very bad phobia of dogs, was not bothered by it because she was watching it carefully and it was well trained and behaved.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dh6bka,Northern European family comes to random Southern California feed store,"Quick TL;DR at the bottom.

So, this is a story from my neighbor/friend. They work in a feed store, which sells a variety of hay, horse supplies, cooking grills, dog food, cat food, a bunch of other animal food, and much more. It is in the middle of nowhere (not near any tourist attractions, and nowhere you’d go for fun). It’s the type of place where it’s regulars only who come in, and put things on their tab.

Well one day, this Northern European (Norway, Sweden, Finland...) family walks into the tiny store. They spoke perfect English, but mainly their respective language. They were also dressed up in full “cowboy” garb. Hats, vests, jeans, chaps, leather fringe, boots, and even spurs. 

Nobody really dresses like that.

It was such a strange thing. They just walked around the store talking amongst themselves. Of course, they were totally respectful and nice (everybody from Northern Europe is, right???). They left after buying a few random things from the random selection of goods. 

I don’t know why showed up, or why they were dressed the way they were. My best guess is that they were vacationing around America, and wanted the full experience..? Either way, great for them, and it was hilarious. Not all retail stories are awful! I’d also like to hear what other ideas there are as to why they came.

***TL;DR***: Northern European family comes to middle of no where store dressed as cowboys, and no one really dresses like cowboys, unless you are at Ram Ranch. And when you are at ram ranch, you aren’t dressed.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dh3yeq,“WHERES YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE?”,"I’m on mobile I apologise in advance for formatting

So today at work (a supermarket) I was on the basket only till and there was another employee on the next one. They are next to each other but face in opposite directions. 

We were talking a bit and also serving customers as a woman walks up to the till, jumping the queue. 

AC: angry customer 

AC: “EXCUSE ME, where is the queue” 

Me: you can queue up at the end, both of these tills are open 

AC then walks around the back of my till and to the side where the items go after the are scanned, and hands me an item, which I scan anyway as the other customers were being served at the next till, without speaking 

AC: SMILE, SMILE, you could be on camera

I ignore her to scan the item and she repeats this again in my face, while I’m feeling uncomfortable and already not in a good mood 

Me: that is £6 altogether please 

She hands me the money and I print the receipt, thinking this was over

The other customers in the queue seemed as shocked as I was ... I might have been a bit quiet as I’d only been awake an hour and only been at work for 15 minutes but I was never rude to her, I don’t understand why people shout at and complain at retail employees when they are just doing their job, in my case so I can afford university.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dh5afr,The embodiment of a tin foil hat,"Hi, 

so to get started I work at a phone store that sells phones along with cell service, I get this guy who comes from another one of our store locations breathing heavy while standing right behind the counter with me, he went on to explaining to me how it doesn't make sense that he would have to come to this store to get served (Side note with this store if you're going to exchange within the allowable period you go to the store you got it from)  I proceed to explain this to him without getting anywhere.  After he had further explained the situation to me that his phone had been hacked, he can't get into it, and now he's going to switch all of his banking cards based off this assumption, I told him that ""there is nothing to be worried about you probably did something without knowing any better that locked your phone"" to which he kind've gave me a (Do you really think i'm that dumb look).  After assessing the phone and the story he told me, I went to go in the back room with his phone to plug into one of our computers that we do troubleshooting on, I also just didn't want this guy breathing down my neck for any longer.  As I went to go into the backroom he immediately started to question me about what I was doing and when I told him that I was simply going to plug his phone into one of our troubleshooting computers he began to get restless, telling me to stay where he his so that he can ""F\*\*\*ing see"" what I was going to do.  Unfortunately for him i'm not all that kind when disrespected even if it could mean my job, and thankfully for me my manager almost always backs me up in these situations as he's dealt with many more of these types of people.  After he says this I immediately tell him that ""Sir if you want my help i'll give it to you, i'm payed to do it, but if you want to continue with that crap i'll personally walk you out the door, I don't care if you feel that i'm here to take that type of crap because i'm not""  He then went silent for a couple of seconds and told me to go back and do what i've got to do.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After about 10 minutes of looking at the phone I see no way of fixing it, I guess he really screwed his phone over but i'm still not convinced it's been hacked, probably a dud.  So as i'm walking back out to where he is I check the safes to see if we have the same phone for him that we can exchange and of course we wouldn't.  With what I know now I speak with him giving him the rundown ""We don't have this phone in stock right now sir, we'll have to order one in for you and exchange it than, in the meantime you can borrow a loaner of ours""  He seems satisfied and apologizes for his actions earlier to which I said that it was fine, we get it all the time but it doesn't help either one of us when someone's going off there head. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been two months now every thing has been exchanged, he's been called with no response hanging onto our loaner phone that is 4 years older than the new one he had bought, I guess he doesn't care to much for his new phone.   All I can say is that I feel for all of you out there who currently work for retail and have to deal with this on a regular basis.  These types of customers always grind my gears, honestly makes me believe that they've never had to work a job dealing with the public on a regular basis or they just forget how to be human.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dh0p2x,Lady that’s not how that works,"Background: I work at a craft store. We allow people to order things online and ship them to the store and they don’t have to pay for shipping. The sales online are often different than the ones online and because of this we can’t price match with our website. The online prices are usually cheaper because they usually take shipping into account. 

This woman came up and while I was ringing her up asked me if we price match with our website. I told her no and before I could explain she just yelled “STOP.” 

I wasn’t dealing with this so I called my manager

Long story short, the items she wanted were $5 cheaper online but had a buy 3 get 2 free sale in the store. She wanted the b3g2 deal for the online price. My manager noticed she was looking at a completely different product online than what she had in front of her and went to go retrieve the correct one. 

When she came back with the right product the lady started going off about how my manager said she was going to honor the online price which never happened, but my manager is nice so she did. I overheard this lady going off again because she didn’t factor in tax and was telling my manager she did something wrong because it was too much now. 

As it turns out the CORRECT item she was looking at was only $2 more expensive than the online price. After the whole transaction she looked at me and told me it was ridiculous that I didn’t adjust the price and that I gave her bad customer service that she’s be reporting. 
 
It would be interesting if she did considering I handed in my two week notice today. 

Tl;dr: Customer wanted the online price for an item for the in store deal. Store doesn’t allow price matching between the two because of different deals that goes on. Told me I have her bad customer service for not adjusting the price and would be reporting me.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dh0ic7,Deaf woman bluffed about going to a competitor store because I wouldn’t honor a coupon.,"Some backstory: I work at a craft store. Some brands (Circuit, LEGO etc.)  will not allow coupons on their items. This is not something my store/manager is able to over ride. Our registers will not do it.  This woman brings up one Circuit vinyl and one of our store’s brand vinyl. The circuit’s are on a buy 2 get 1 free deal whereas the the store brand are 60% off today. Neither of those will allow a 50% off a regular price item to be used on them. 

Cast: Me:me.  DL: deaf lady H: husband  

DL: *lays down vinyls and shows me a 50% off a regular price competitor coupon* 

Me: oh sorry. Coupons don’t work on circuit products and the other vinyl is on sale. There’s a 20% off your total purchase coupon you can use for the store brand vinyl though 

DL: *signs to her husband with an angry face* 

H:*translate what I said* She said that she should be able to use the 50% coupon 

Me: coupons don’t work on circuit products and the other item is on sale so I can’t use that coupon. There’s a 20% off we can use. 

H:*translates  then sighs* 

DL: *pulls up app and goes straight to 40% off a regular priced item* 

Me: *thinking she scrolled to the wrong one scroll back up to the 20% off coupon to scan* 

DL: *aggressively scrolling back to 40% off coupon and signing to her husband* 

H: *signs back and mouths that she doesn’t have a regular priced item* 

DL: *aggressively points to circuit vinyl causing both me and the husband to explain again.* 

She finally lets me scan the 20% off coupon, after seeing it only took 88 cents off (because the store brand vinyl was only $4 after the sale) pauses and get angry and starts signing again. 

H: She says she could go to Competitor store and use the 50% off coupon 

Me: ...okay so she doesn’t want them? *getting ready to cancel the transaction cause at this point I have a line* 

She pauses for 30 seconds just staring a the pin pad then signs back at him and huffs at me.

H: So you don’t want her business

Me: :)

After another brief moment she groans and pays then leaves, aggressively reading the receipt. 

TL;DR: Deaf woman came in my line with husband. She wanted to buy items that she couldn’t use a coupon on. She didn’t get enough off with the coupon she could use and tried to haggle me into giving her more off by telling me she was going to a competitor store. Her total came to $16.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dgyi11,Rude Lady Refuses to Speak in Language We Both Know,"I moved to a region recently where there are two official languages. I only speak one of them, but that's generally enough to get by as everyone else speaks the other too. Catalan, the language I don't know, is only spoken here on this region and nowhere else in the world (except Andorra).

So on my previous job in a big clothes department store, this lady came up to me and started talking to me in the other, less-common language that I don't speak. I politely reply in Spanish, as I understand a little bit of Catalan and can sort of hold a conversation like this. Even though I'm from Latin America and my accent clearly shows it (that is, it's obvious by my way of speaking that I'm foreign), this lady insists on speaking in Catalan, which is fine, a lot of people do that here because they have this intense sense of patriotism and I guess they do it as a way to force people to learn their native language. My family's all from here so I sort of get it and just go along with it. However, by the time this happened I had just arrived to the region a few months ago and I couldn't understand Catalan completely if spoken fast, and I had to ask this lady to repeat herself a couple of times. She has been incredibly rude and mean the whole time, almost yelling at me and treating me like a slave, making me show her random items that her son would like and dismissing them saying ""he wouldn't like that!"" like if I knew her son and would know what he wants, until we finally go to check out and she says something else to me. As usual throughout this painful interaction, I had to ask her to repeat herself because she keeps speaking in Catalan even though I haven't replied in Catalan once and she finally snaps and yells at me ""SHOULD I SPEAK IN SPANISH OR CATALAN?! DON'T MAKE ME WASTE MY TIME"", and I just stared at her blankly and say: ""Spanish, ma'am. I thought that was obvious"".

The lady left with her stupid son's present and I've hated her for the rest of my life.

Just in case anyone's wondering why I didn't ask her from the beginning to speak in Spanish: People here usually automatically switch to Spanish when they notice you're foreign, but there's also this complicated political situation where many Catalonians hate Spanish and Spain in general, so since I'm the newcomer here, it makes me scared to spark a political debate or make people upset, and working in retail, you don't have much power to go against the customers, so I just tried to accommodate to people like these in the best way I could.",TalesFromRetail

On this pallet was a big rack for displaying the books, and it came in a large cardboard box, that I had cut open in the front and pulled the rack out.


A man and his kid (5ish years maybe) came up to pay. The man had a few things for his job, and the kid had an activity book from last season. The man brought me in to their chat about doing a few of the pages in the book, so I opened it and said ""Oooh, look, bats!""


The kid was a little bit shy, so he escaped the conversation while his dad was paying. I kept my eye on him, as all my stuff made a slightly risky environment, and naturally he did what every kid would do. So when payment was done, I said to the dad: ""Your kid disappeared into that big box. I'm done with it, so if you want a huge box to play with during the weekend, feel free to grab it."" 


And they took it! They were so happy, though the kid was still too shy to thank me. I was equally happy, because I no longer needed to struggle with throwing away the huge box. A win-win, and a nice end to the week.",TalesFromRetail

I head back, and he tells me that he needs me to help a customer with a return (he'd never processed done a return before). I introduce myself to the customer. The customer is doing a smug lean on the counter, which gives off a bad vibe, but I don't say anything about it. Leaning customer (LC) explains to me that he bought two pairs of reading glasses, but one of them is missing a nose pad, and is therefore impossible to wear. He wants to exchange the broken pair for a new pair. Seems routine, until I see his receipt. He bought the readers as part of a special, BOGO free (One pair billed at $19.99, one billed at $17.99, with the cheaper one free). Unless I ring in both pairs of glasses as a return, they're going to come up free.

Me: ""Sir, you bought these as part of a BOGO free special, I can't give you anything unless you return both""

LC: ""You don't understand, I want to exchange the broken pair for this ($21.99) pair, I'll even give you the difference between that ($17.99) pair and the ($21.99) pair.""

Me: ""We have eyeglass repair kits which include spare nose pieces."" (I say this because it would have been the cost of ""the difference"")

LC: ""I don't see why I would buy one of those when I can just return the broken pair and get a new pair""

Me: ""Sir, you didn't get the broken pair for $17.99, you got it for free. The only way I can do an exchange is if you return both pairs, then I can give the ($21.99) pair for the difference.""

LC then gets flustered and tries to convince me. I think he thought he could bend the rules since one pair was broken, but I continue to explain that the only way he can do an exchange is if he returns both pairs.

LC: ""Fine then, I'll return both, and I'm not gonna buy anything!""

The return then processes as normal and he gives me both pairs of readers. I don't know if he thought I was stupid, would cave, or possibly both. Either way, I'm not going to risk my job over a pair of readers. I asked my store manager about it the next day, and she told me I made the right call.

Edit: The register design may have been suboptimal, sure. It still annoyed me that he was trying to get around the system.

\#1 this customer brings one small tray of beef up to the counter and asks for a plastic bag. I say no sorry we don't have any but we have free boxes or a reusable bag option for $1.

C- SO HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CARRY THIS TO MY CAR???

C then started going on about how we have such bad customer service and that we should be providing plastic bags for free, then just ends up carrying the tray WITH HER HANDS back to the car that was parked 2 meters from our shop. 

&amp;#x200B;

\#2 we have a self serve ""salted brisket"" station thing where you could take a BB and tongs and pick out which pieces you wanted from a large container and have it weighed up at the counter. 

sometimes people bring up their BB full to the brim, hands wet, meat dripping, pay and leave -no complaints at all, sometimes take a box, which is fine but I have customers that take only 1 or 2 pieces and demand an extra bag even tho its obvious that there's no dripping. 

I offer them a free box or a reusable bag for $1 but no. they want a PLASTIC bag. I say no sorry I don't have any (I really don't) the prime minister banned them and we could get fined if we gave out plastic carry bags. 

a customer literally said ""fuck the prime minister"" and I was honestly baffled.

\#3 someone once brought up their BB of brisket and asked for an extra BB which I was told to charge extra 20c for by my boss and so I told the customer that and they got angry and said

C- what??

ME- the extra BB is 20c because you really don't NEED it and we're trying to cut down the use of plastic but we have free boxes or $1 reusable bags if you want

C- NO, I have heaps of boxes and reusable bags at home. they're such a waste of space. I don't want them.  
you know what? I don't want this meat anymore if I have to pay for a BB

and just storms out of the shop. 

I really don't understand the gall of these people. you have heaps of REUSABLE bags and boxes at home but refuse to bring them with you shopping? my parents have a few boxes in the car boot all the time, it shouldn't be that hard to reuse your reusable bags and boxes. if you just leave them to sit at home that just defeats the point of having them.

t3_dggjt1,Why can’t i just tell you my birthday instead?!?!,"Okay so i work in a “tobacco” store. We sell pipes, bongs, bagged tobaccos etc etc. all things that require ID to purchase if you look young of course. We also have a sign on the door that says “You come in together, you’ll get carded together” only because of the amount of 18yr olds that come in with their 15/16yr old friend trying to buy cigarettes or juul pods. I was about to close when 3 teenagers walk in, i was honestly already guessing the girl wasn’t gonna have ID on her. The two boys pick out some rolling tubes and a bag of tobacco together. They all come up to my register (the girl was hanging out away from them to try and not get carded i’m sure) and what i expected happens-

me- “okay cool! now i just need everyone’s ID’s”

boy- well i have mine but they don’t have them but it’s fine it’s for me

me- alright i’m really sorry but i can’t sell you this stuff unless all of you have IDs 

B- what????? i’m the one BUYING IT why do they need them?!

me- because the cameras saw you two pick everything out and discuss it together so i have to assume you’ll share it, i can’t, by law, sell you any of this unless everyone has ID

girl- that’s fucking stupid I CAN TELL YOU MY BIRTHDAY

me- that’s cool but that’s not ID, it says on the door if you all come in together you gotta have ID i’m really sorry

Their mom then comes in while they’re still arguing with me, attempts to buy it for them, and i had to explain to her as well that i couldn’t sell it to her because obviously the cameras saw it’s for them and they don’t have ID. Thankfully she doesn’t argue too much (unlike parents in the past) and they all leave empty handed, the kids still running their mouths at me as they walk out. 
It’s ridiculous how many times i’ve had teenagers yell about how they know their birthday and that i don’t need their ID since they do. i’m nearly 24 years old and always have my ID on me when needed because i look like a child, but i’ll just stop carrying it since i know my birthday and that obviously counts!

t3_dg2itz,I can't change the law,"My state recently changed the law and alcohol sales are now allowed on Sundays in retail stores.  Before, only Wineries and Micro Breweries could sell take out alcohol.  

The law is still pretty restrictive. 12pm-8pm on Sunday.  Our registers literally will not allow us to sell outside those hours.  

Guy gets in my line.  First and foremost he places his case of beer on the belt.  I'm still waiting on my current customer and glance at my monitor to see it is 11:48am.  She's disputing some of the prices so I have to focus on her.

Finally his turn.  He's now known as Beer Guy  (BG) and I'm me.

Me: How are you today?

BG: *grunt*

Me: Unfortunately, Sir, it is 11:53 am.  I cannot sell you this beer for 7 more minutes.

BG: Are you fucking kidding me?

Me: No, I'm not. Alcohol sales are only allowed from 12pm to 8pm.  The register will not even allow me to ring the beer up.

BG: Try it anyway.  

Me: [*scans beer, gets error message*] It says 'Item not for sale'.

BG: Make it

Me: Excuse me?

BG: Make it go through. 

Me: Sir, there's nothing I can do until noon.

BG: Store manager now.

Me: She's not available right now.  Unfortunately the only managers in the store are me and another that's been here less than a year.  There's nothing we can do until noon.  It's now 11:56.  You have about 4 minutes.

t3_dg214n,CRAZY LADY TRIES TO STEAL AN XBOX BEFORE THE STORE OPENS,"I work as a warehouse stock person in an electronics store. Basically, I go around to every shelf in the departments and make sure the products are in the place they should be. It's a pretty easy gig, especially since I clock-in and clock-out before the store opens, so I NEVER interact with customers...until today.

It was a pretty typical morning of checking off the shelved products when I heard someone loudly banging on the locked front doors. I could hear it all the way from the back of the store where I was wrapping a security tag onto an Xbox One X (important for later). While carrying the Xbox, I walk into view of the doors and see a 30-something year old woman banging her fist on the glass. I saw that she was wearing a jacket with the company color on it so I assumed she was a co-worker. She stopped banging when she saw me and waved hello. REMEMBER, I only work the before opening shifts so I never interact with customers BUT I also don't know all of my other co-workers who *do* work during store hours. I thought to myself ""oh! she must be one of the sales-reps."" because they often come in 30 minutes early if they have an opening shift and it was around 40 minutes until opening so it didn't raise any alarm with me.

I walk up to the front doors. There are two sets of them with a vestibule in between them. The first set opens to the outside and lets you into the vestibule, the second set opens to the vestibule and lets you into the store. The lady is standing outside. I take the Xbox I was holding and place it on a register counter nearest the doors. I unlock the second set of doors and step up to the first set and begin pushing it open when the lady shoves her body through the opening of the doors. I guess waiting 2 whole seconds for me to finish opening the door was too much for her. She is already passed the second set doors and walking into the store when I finish closing and locking both sets. She wasn't walking to a register to clock-in, she wasn't directly walking to any department, all she did was quickly look around the store before turning back to me and says ""Where is your game section? I'm looking for a Switch.""

My. Heart. Dropped. SHE WAS A CUSTOMER THAT I LET INTO THE STORE BEFORE OPENING! BIG NO-NO!

I start to internally panic a little but think to myself that all I need to do is get her out of the store. 

Me - ""I'm sorry ma'am but we don't open for another 40 minutes. I thought you were one of my co-workers when I let you in."" 

The crazy lady rolls her eyes and says ""the website says that you open at 8 am, it is 8:20."" 

Me - ""*Our* website says 9 am. I'm telling you 9 am, you need to leave.""

Crazy Lady - ""I only need to buy a Switch, I will be 10 minutes.""

She begins to walk further into the story when I stand in her path.

Me- ""You can buy whatever you want at 9 am but right now, you need to leave.""

This lady is getting pissed and says ""I want to speak to your manager right now!""

Now, I was the only one working in the warehouse that morning (we are really understaffed) but there was a supervisor in the back office doing paperwork. The supervisor is a really understanding dude so I knew he wouldn't get mad at me for letting this crazy lady in by mistake but I made the idiot decision to deal with this myself.

Me - I am the only one here, now leave!

This is a good time to tell you all that I am a 5' 3"" 110lbs female who looks like a 15 year old when I'm really in my 20's. I do not look intimidating in any way.

The crazy lady got this smirk on her face and said ""fine, I'll go."" and when she started to walk to the doors I think that's the end of it UNTIL SHE GRABS THE XBOX OFF OF THE COUNTER AND TRIES TO UNLOCK THE DOORS! I rushed up to her and begin to tug at the Xbox while yelling at her to ""let go!"" and ""I will call the police!"" The Xbox was wrapped in a security tag so the whole time this tug-of-war was happening the door alarms are blaring because of the tag. My supervisor hears the alarm and comes out of the back office to find me wrestling with this fucking crazy Karen. He comes over to help but not before the crazy lady punched me hard in the stomach. I let go of the Xbox to hold my stomach but she still doesn't have the door unlocked. I ended up puking on her and the Xbox because she punched me so hard. She drops the Xbox and goes to hit me again but I saw this one coming and mustered up all my strength and rage to kick her square in the chest.

I might not look strong but I can damn well be when needed...but I only had the strength for that one kick, I rolled into a ball and agonized over the pain afterwards.

My supervisor called the police while the woman whined in pain and was STILL trying to unlock the door... I guess she didn't realize that keys are used to open doors.

t3_dga993,Well That's One Way to Make Guacamole,"This story happened back during the very first weeks my family bought our supermarket. Please keep in mind we were still very new to the business world and had not yet been able to maintain professional appearances at all times.

I was about 10 years old at the time hanging out by the registers when Crazy woman came wanting to return an avocado. Issue was she had a large green avocado whereas we only sold the small black ones therefore we could not do a return. Upon being told this she became belligerent and screaming at the top of her lungs about poor customer service.

My mom (owner) hearing the commotion came down from the store office and tried to reason with her and calm down the situation to no avail. Crazy Lady became so enraged she decides to throw the avocado onto the counter causing the avocado pit (which was quite large and could've been pretty painful) to almost hit me and also splatter some green goo on me.

This caused my mom to go full Mama Bear on her and proceeded to grab the avocado mush and fling it straight back at Crazy Lady. This led to 30 glorious seconds of pure green chaos as they flung it back and forth towards each other until the lady finally exited the store (covered in green). Definitely not the most professional moment of our career but certainly very entertaining.

Tragically through we did suffer a great loss because of this. During the avocado battle a green blob fatally struck a passing fly causing it to drown  in a pile of unseasoned guac. I hope he knew that his death was not in vain and he was able have a taste of that glorious guac before he passed from our world.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dg6mrl,Customer Informs Me the Store Closed Prematurely Last Week,"First time writing here but long time lurker. I am the store manager of a pool supply store and I have seen some of my fair share of stories. Today in particular stands out to me because a customer came into my store and pulled me aside to tell me that last week she arrived to the store at 5:55pm to buy something (we close at 6pm.) 

I asked her what day it was and she proceeds to tell me it was on a Wednesday. Saying ""this isn't how we should run our businesses."" Like ma'am, I don't answer to you so I don't know who this ""we"" is but okay...

Immediately I rebuke that statement, only mentally, because I closed on Wednesday and have never locked those doors even a second before they were supposed to be.

Rather than call her out for it though, as she does spend fairly decent sums of money with us, I turned the situation around and informed her I'd have a talk with my staff about ensuring that the doors do stay open until 6pm so that it doesn't happen again (even though it didn't happen to begin with.)

TL;DR: Customer told me the store closed prematurely on a day I worked when I know for fact it didn't and I'm just not sure how she could possibly be daft enough to not figure out how to read a clock.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dg5oly,Customer has a Meltdown over $10,"Finally, a full scale crazy-nova at my till, buckle up buckaroos!

I work at an international super market chain that allows staff to sit at tills.

I was having a pretty swell day, nearly every customer had been a friendly regular so all is cruisy. Untill I spot an older woman, whos trying reallllllly hard to look younger, unloadinger her trolly onto my tread.

She brings the trolly up but leaves some produce in it, I ask her if they were from our store, she doesnt answer. Instead she pushes back past some customers in line to grab more bags. I just start pulling out the prod and scanning it in, I could tell it was ours but wanted to give her a chance to get it out herself.

I scan in all her groccerries quietly, things are chill and it come to $149.07.

I read the total and ask her 'cash or card?'. She doesnt answer again and just contiues to slowly put the items in one at a time.

I assume she didnt hear and wait untill she finishes, i read the total again and finally get an answer of card.

I enable the eftpos and she sticks her card in, she then asks what the total is, keep in mind it's displayed on the eftpos machine. I repeat the total a third time for her, still cheery and smiling.

Her card declines, cool no issue, she asks if she can pay some with cash and then the rest on card.

'oh of course, no worries' I say as I accept the cash off her. She says it's $50 just as I'm putting it in but I still half of it in hand and I remembered exactly what she gave. One $20, one $10 and two $5.

A little dread knot forms as I knew she wouldnt take the facts of basic math well.

i start to explain what she's actually given me but she cuts me off and instantly gets aggresive while repeating 'It's $50! I gave you $50, that's $50'. I learnt from this sub about quick change artists and I also didnt want my till to be out, least of all for someone like this. 

I start to get the adrenline shakes, i hate this as it makes my voice quiver even though I'm not scared of this woman in the slightest. I don't want her to hear my voice shake and think its an opening to attack so I quickly but politely tell her.

'I'll have to quickly go and count my till, that way I know exactly what it is. I'll call a manager up so we can suspend this in the mean time'

While waiting for a manager, she doesnt take long to go from frustrated to full blown bitch.

'Go ahead! I can wait, I've got All day!' ... I know she's trying to use the waiting que to preasure me, I just smile and say no worries, she gets madder.

'Yeah! I can stand here all day, rather than just sitting around, i can pull up a chair too! How about you offer me a seat too huh?!' 

I'm dumb founded but keepy face neutral. The line is long and full of regulars who LOVE me, none of the other tills have chairs so I smile, stand and say. 'Not a problem Ma'am, please, feel free to have My chair'

I awkwardly push my office chair out of the register cube and directly to her, she sits down without a thank you while everyone in line judges her harshly.

I know they're all on my side if I need a witness to vouch.

A manager finally arrives, suspends the customer's sale and jumps in for me while I go to count. I'm not even to the office door 10 meters away when I hear her screaming at him for moving her trolly aside so he can serve others.

She starts yelling.

'Don't you touch my Trolly! I JUST WANT TO BUY MY GROCCERIES! (she points over at me) I ALREADY GAVE THAT GIRL $50 AND SHE ACCUSED ME OF SHORT CHANGING HER! THE LIAR I WOULD NEVER!'

I &amp; the manager make eye contact and I try to give a look that says 'no i definitly fucking didnt' and left to count up.

While counting, I could hear her SCREAMING through the thick brick walls, i couldnt make out words but she was consistently going for it. With our money weighing machine, it only took me a few minutes to count and it turned out I was right, she only gave me $40.

I head back out and she's practically out the doors, attempting to leave with her FULL trolly. The manager who jumped in for me has left the till and is refusing to let go of her trolly and she's screaming right in his face.

'I ALREADY GAVE THE GIRL $50, GIVE ME MY FUCKING SHOPPING!'

Then suddenly, like an angel, our head manager arrives out of No where, just in time. He mellowed her out by telling her she had two choices.

Either come back in and pay or he'll call the cops and file a report.

She gapes and says 'Of Course I want to PAY!'

sure you did

I gave the head manager the details and quickly went back to work, not wanting to be dragged into her maw of spite.

The manager ended up just giving her the $10 to get rid of her but also got her to pay for her grocceries. He basically said to us later that if she shows up again to buzz him immediately so he can boot her out.

PS. The customers who had all been waiting and dealing with her tantrum overheard that she did only give me $40. So they all laughed even harder at her when she left.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dg029v,Some customers are so stupid,"I worked in a retail chain in the middle of a busy city in England about 10 years ago. The long tedious days of tidying up after arsehole customers made me leave in the end but that's not what this story is about. 

The company was a big nation wide one and even had some international shops and they ran promotions in different forms from one time to another. This one time I remember we had a ridiculous way of marketing a promotion, usually it would just be a blanket 20% off women's wear, or formal wear etc or £10 discount if you spend £40 etc. 

This particular time our manager explained that we had to give the customer a scratch card with (15% discount on every single one) but that we had to explain the card to customers even though it was printed on the scratch card, but just to speed things up a bit and give the customer the gist of the competition, but mosty importantly not to let anyone fail to get the discount. The question on the card was ""what is an anagram of disconut?"" I remember panicking because I couldn't remember what an anagram was and not wanting to look stupid in front of my manager quickly read the two options ""discount"" or ""sausage"". After realising it couldn't be sausage and it had to be discount as there were no s's in disconut. I remember thinking ""oh god were gona have so many people struggle with this question""

I kind of felt bad for the customers the first few days and if the struggled to remember what an anagram was,  I would explain it was like countdown and its just the letters in a different order. This got boring really quickly so I just decided that as the tickets were identical I'd just tell the customers it was answer A and they would get there discount. After about a month of this I got so bored of it I just let customers deal with it themselves and if they got it wrong just give them a new one and say ""try again, the tickets are identical"". 

After about 5 weeks of the 6 week promotion even the world stupidest customer comes to my till, I give her her scratch card, I scan her stuff, remove the security tags, bag it up and before i hit total i have to scan the scratch card to apply the discount so I ask the lady for the scratch card, she has scratched answer B, it says sorry you weren't correct or something to that effect. Not wanting her to lose the discount. I gave her a new one and she scratched off B again. I explained that the tickets were identical and she should have another go. She scratched off B again. At this point I wondering if she is taking the piss but I'm a bit bored so whatever. I give her a 4th scratchcard, B again. The que is starting to grow a bit now and even though there are 7 or 8 tills, its a busy shop so I say this will have to be your last go I'm afraid and give her a scratch card. I have no words as I saw her scratch off B again. At this point i had to tell her that I'm sorry but she does not qualify for the 15% discount and she quite merrily paid full price then said ""I can't believe how unlucky I am 5 wrong in a row"" I said yes you must be very unlucky that's a record in this store"" and she went on her way. 

I told my boss and the girls that worked there about it and we all had a good laugh and that year at the Christmas party ever person got a joke award prize and I got mine for the only person in the store to refuse a customer free discount.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dfw4cs,Rug-less,"I work for large Swedish furniture retailer as a cashier, we close at 9:00 and we often manage to get all the customers out the store by 9:10ish. I had this one family just after 9:00 who had been at my till for quite some time now, it normally takes 2-3 minutes to serve one person with that amount of shopping but the family I served spent ages and were collectively arguing over silly little things and asking me which products were better value for money (I'd understand with a large piece of furniture but arguing with each other between £3 or £4 fairy lights is ridiculous). I told the mother who looked as though she was buying all the products before me, that I wouldn't scan anything until she had decided (this affects my performance ratings) and stressed how the shop was already closed. She sarcastically sympathised with me before blatantly talking to her family about my ""awful"" customer service. Eventually we came to scan some rugs she picked up which showed up as £85 on the till, the mother then *exploded* and *demanded* I reduce the price to £35 as she allegedly saw a label for it. I didn't believe this and called someone from the rugs department to check the label and all the while she was right next to me shouting how she would take the phone from my hand and explain how ""*I am offering a very poor service and should be sacked*"". I had to cover my ear to hear the man from rugs and apparently the £35 rug the family supposedly thought they picked up was a smaller size than the £85 rug. These two rugs were the exact same design however the £35 being a smaller size. I explained this to the family and they then accused me of selling them a rug they had never seen before and how I was basically robbing them \*sigh\* . My manager heard the commotion and offered to walk the mother over to see the rug in question which slowly defused the whole situation and eventually left rug-less.

t3_dfznqv,It’s too early for this,"This is my first time posting any kind of text story to Reddit, so please be gentle with my formatting mistakes. 

Background- 
I’m the manager of a store in the “rent to own” industry. I fell into it like 8 years ago and well... bills kept me working here. I have a lot of wonderful customers, and an equal number of infuriatingly stupid ones. That’s just the business.

A few months ago I had a long time customer want to swap out merchandise on an account she was halfway done paying on. There are two ways I can do this. One is to type up a brand new agreement and adjust the number of payments remaining. The other is to just do an inventory swap. This means that all of the terms (payment amount, number of payments remaining, etc) remain exactly the same. The only thing changed is the merchandise being paid on. That’s it. We did the swap. I knew it would screw me a little since the new system had a higher cost, but this was a good customer and I wanted to make them happy. 

Today-
So the store opens at 10A and it’s 9A when this customer pulls up outside. Since I knew she was just making a payment, I let her in an hour early. 
She immediately starts YELLING about not getting credit for her old merchandise. Now she wasn’t exactly articulate, so it took a minute to understand her complaint. Once I did, I repeatedly tried to show her that we did an inventory swap so she hasn’t lost a single penny of what she paid on the old inventory. 

She just keeps shouting that she doesn’t want to hear it, and a female district manager told her that she didn’t get credit. 
(We don’t have a female district manager. Every single manager above me is male. All the way up to the CEO. My staff is also entirely male aside from me.) Hearing this she starts saying that I must have told her this then. I try AGAIN to explain that I wouldn’t have told her that as it wasn’t true. She goes back to shouting that she doesn’t want to hear it. I offered to give her customer services number so they can explain it. She declines that too. She just wants to make her payment. As I’m scrambling to get change from the till which is still locked up in the back(remember, the store isn’t open yet), she’s shouting for us to just give her the change already. She’s done with us. Etc. Etc. 
She gets her change and stomps out still shouting about how this is bullshit and we are fucking her over. 

And that’s the shit I can’t stand. If she had just managed to conduct herself like an adult for 5 minutes, I could easily have explained to her exactly what we did, and how she’s exactly where she left off. I have literal mountains of paperwork proving what we did. But because she was so set on having her stupid tantrum, she has worked herself up over a fictitious issue. 

tl;dr-  Gave a customer nicer, more expensive merchandise for the same price/payoff as what they had. Customer throws a fit because she thinks she started over on it when she didn’t, won’t listen to proof otherwise. Treats the person who did her a favor like garbage. Is now banned from getting anything else.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dg0iaw,You say i have glue on my hands? How dare you!,"Disclaimer: This is my first post ever and english isn't my first language, so please be gentle.

I am working part time at an organic supermarket, so aside from the normal strange customers, we also have a whole lot of esoteric folks running around. But these people are mostly quite normal, if you forget about the pendulums and their obsession for homeopathy. But this man was just crazy. 

So, after about 2 months of working there, i was still quite nervous as a cashier, even if i was pretty used to the things you expierence in this position by now.  In the later hours of a day in mid-december a man was going to be checked out by me. He was pretty wealthy looking, which isn't unusual, because many of our customers are wealthy middleclass people. 

I can't really remember what he was buying, but it wasn't much, i think he only bought some apples and tofu. He wanted to pay with his bank card. Because the confirmation process ist mostly done by siganture, so whe have the device for the cards next to us and not in front of the customer. He gives me his card and i realise there is something on the card, it felt and smelled like glue, so i thought to myself, that i would give the customer a heads up, so he does not smear this goo on himself and his groceries. (The conversation was originally in german and 3 years ago, so i some things might not translate, or be remembered very well) 

Me: ""Excuse me, but could it be possible that you have glue on your hands, there is something on your card."" 

C: (going immediatley into full on rage mode) ""WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? YOU CAN'T JUST ACCUSE CUSTOMERS TO HAVING GLUE ON THEIR HANDS!"" 

Me: (extremely confused at this point, because he seemed totally normal before) ""Sorry, i just wanted...""

C:""WHY DO YOU EVEN ASSUME I HAVE GLUE ON MY HANDS? I WAS IN THE LABORATORY THE ENTIRE DAY, HOW SHOULD I HAVE GOTTEN GLUE ON MY HANDS? THIS IS EXTREMELY UNPOLITE OF YOU!"" 

By this point i was totally quiet and just let it go over me, because i was feared to saying anything. He would rage the entire payment process and left VERY angry looking. The customers that stood after him in line looked as confused as me. 

To this day, i still don't know what made him this angry and i don't know why he felt the need to state the lab. Maybe he was hiding something, or maybe (and more likely) he just had a bad day. But still, this was just strange as hell.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dfove8,“I don’t want it to ruin my reputation!!”,"I work at the customer service desk at my store. We take care of many things including rainchecks and answering the phone. Last Sunday I got a call that went like this. 

Me: Service desk, this is (name). How can I help you?  
Guy: I got a letter in the mail telling me the item I got a raincheck on is in.   
Me: Well, that means you need to come pick it up. 

The guy doesn’t say anything and I’m confused because we don’t send out letters for rainchecks. I stand there for a while waiting for him to respond but he doesn’t so I assume he tried to hang up and it didn’t work or something. So, after a minute or so, I just hang up. 

A few minutes later the phone rings and I see it’s the same guy. 


Me: Service desk, this is (name). How can I help you?  
Guy: We were talking a few minutes ago, something must have gone wrong when you tried to transfer me. 

I’m thinking: I never said anything about transferring you, where did that idea come from?

Me: Okay, what did you need?

He tells the same thing and says what the item is and I tell him what I told him the first time. 

Guy: But I already picked it up! It’s sitting right here next to me on the couch.  

That just made things seem more weird, because it is a 8 ft tall blow up Halloween skeleton. Like, why is that chilling with you on your couch. But, it’s whatever. 

Me: Well, if you already have it, then you can just disregard the letter.    
Guy: But the letter came to my house today!! I don’t want my reputation ruined because I didn’t come pick up the item! 

Dude. The item isn’t here. Even if it was, no ones going to care if you don’t pick it up. It’ll just go back out on the sales floor after your ten days to get it are up. And there’s no “reputation” that’ll be ruined. I don’t know what made him think that it’s a thing. 

Me: What’s the date on the letter?   
Guy: September 21st.   
Me: And what day did you get your item?
Guy: Last Wednesday. (October 2nd)   
Me: That means the letter was sent out before you got the item.   
Guy: But the letter just came today!

At this point I’m just frustrated. It’s a Sunday, so it’s obviously from a previous day, when mail is actually delivered. I spend another 5 minutes explaining this over and over to the guy until he gets it. After he finally understands, he says this. 

Guy: Well, okay then. I’ll let you get back to watching the football game.

t3_dfmgn6,Customer Flips Out that I won't do a return on an Expired Product that a STRANGER bought him,"First time poster on mobile so sorry for an mistakes

A little background: My family owns a small supermarket in an area that is predominantly Hispanic so the main language of most customers and our employees is Spanish. Since I'm the owner's daughter/ store manager and am bilingual the task of dealing with English speaking customers usually falls on to me or my brother if he's also working. The issue with this is while I'm a 23 Female College Student I look very young for my age therefore people mistake me as an lowly 15 year old and rarely given me any respect as a manager so it can be hard to control some customers. This story is such a case

A cashier calls me over because a customer would like to make a return but he does not have a receipt. Now our policy is that no cashier can make any returns without the receipt but since I'm the manager I have the power to override this if I feel there's a real issue with the product or if I recognize the customer and believe that they really did buy it from us.

The man in question was one I did not recognize as a regular in our store and the product in question for a return was a bottle of vegetable oil that had expired 2 YEARS AGO. Now I'm not going to pretend that my store is perfect and we never have any damaged or expired items on shelves that we missed but something that expired 2 years ago? Very unlikely that we would've missed that. 

Either way I asked the man if he had his receipt. He proceeds to tell me that he does not because another man had came into the store and bought it for him. I tell him that I can not do the return without the receipt and if he can ask to see if his friend still had it. He tells me that he can not because he does not know the man. Ummmmmm

He continues saying that a stranger came with his wife and kids and bought the groceries and he cannot ask for the receipt because he does not know him. I then ask him if he could ask his wife if she could get the receipt from this ""stranger"" and he starts to scream about he can't contact the other man because he is a stranger and he does not know him........but he came to the store with his wife and kids. I tell him there is nothing I can do for him and he starts screaming and insulting every part of my being (my appearance, personality and even spirituality) because I'm such a cruel person for not letting him return the 2 year old vegetable oil that a stranger bought for him.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dfrsp9,She was so happy that I helped her,"I work at a store that started taking returns from an online website in July. The only way I can take a return is if I have a scalable or a specific readable code from the website it’s self. I can’t just scan the item and return it that way.

I’m at my usual post in customer service with a coworker next to me. It’s been a slow day. This super nice older lady comes in, wanting to return to the website. I ask for code, she doesn’t have it. I ask if she has a smartphone, and she does! We go to their website, and she can’t remember her password, so we reset it. Then go through the return process. 

I took the item and did what I have to do with them. She was so appreciative. Genuinely happy. It honestly made my day to see how happy taking 15 minutes and helping her figure out technology made her.",TalesFromRetail

Me - the part-timer

OL - Orange Lady


I had just started my evening shift, and I was filling the potatoes at the front of the store. 

OL: ""Who's in charge around here?!"" 

A lady, probably late 60's if I was to guess, was standing beside the oranges half way down the isle looking straight at me. I briefly looked around to see if C or S were around but they were out back. 

Me: ""How can I help you?""

OL: ""Now I got these oranges earlier in the week and they are just AWFUL! They are disgusting! They shouldn't even be on the shelf they are so sour!""

Now, the bag she got was prepackaged, and labelled reduced to clear at a cheaper price as they were the last of our NZ Oranges at that point. However, we hadn't had oranges at all for at least 2 weeks. Meaning that she had these oranges from probably 3 weeks ago, that she is bringing back now, without a receipt.

Cue C coming into the store, looking at me as I look at him pleadingly to save me, smiling, suppressing laughter, before walking to fill a shelf. 

OL is still going on about how bad the oranges were and how she should get them replaced (it was a bag of 3) AND she should get the ones she was planning to purchase anyway free too! Also asking if the Australian Oranges were any better.

Thankfully, S came out, saw her beside me, and rescued me. I think she ended up getting 3 free. We were talking out back after it happened, turned out she's been coming in weekly for the past couple months doing the same thing. 


Skip forward a couple months (this happened probably 3 months ago?), S comes in on another shift to tell us that OL called earlier that day and that we should expect a visit from her that evening after she complained about the oranges again because ""they are too sour!"" and apparently, ""my husband likes them sweet!""",TalesFromRetail
t3_df311t,Free Trials,"**Background:**

I work at the customer service desk at a warehouse store where a membership is required to shop. Everyone who opens a membership has to come to the desk, if only to pick up their store cards when they open the account online. If not, we process the new account in store.

Every so often, corporate sends out offers for a ""free 3 - month trial membership."" These are part of a mass mailing list (I've worked there for two years and I get them occasionally), and the main goal is to get new customers in the door. Printed on every one of these mailers is ""NEW MEMBERS ONLY."" Existing customers cannot open a trial, but the flyer also includes a promo code for a discounted renewal for existing members (Over half off).

**Cast:**

&gt;Me: Me

&gt;AG: Angry Guy

&gt;MOD: Manager on Duty, not in my department

**The Story:**

Last Saturday, I was working at the desk when an older gentleman came in. He threw the flyer down and asked me to open a trial.

&gt;AG: Hi, I'd like to use this free 3-month offer.

&gt;Me: Sure, have you ever been a member with us before?

&gt;AG: No.

&gt;Me: Okay, I just need an ID and I can start processing the account right away.

When people open memberships, their driver's license number is entered along with name, address, etc. Because of this, corporate asks that we check new members against the database to make sure they are not taking advantage of promotional offers like this. I enter his license number, and an account shows up. No surprise there, people try to pull this all the time.

&gt;Me: Unfortunately, there's already an account in your name. I won't be able to process the trial because that offer is only good for new customers.

Most people realize they've been caught in a lie, and I'll then offer to renew the old account for a discount. It's about half and half whether people do that or say ""never mind."" AG was neither.

&gt;AG: WELL THEN WHY DID I GET THIS FLYER? IF I GET THIS IN THE MAIL, I *EXPECT* IT TO BE HONORED.

&gt;Me: I do apologize, but I don't have a way to put this through without my computer blocking it (not technically true, but I can get in trouble for overriding it. Also, when corporate secret shops the store, they check to make sure we aren't opening new accounts for existing customers).

&gt;AG: WELL THEN I NEED TO SPEAK TO THE STORE MANAGER BECAUSE UNTIL YOU GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER AND TAKE ME OFF THE MAILING LIST I EXPECT THIS TO BE HONORED.

&gt;Me: Sure, just a moment.

I get on the radio and page the manager on duty to the front desk. Meanwhile, my coworker, who is with her own customer, looks over at me and (out of view of the customer) mouths ""what the f***???""

While we wait for the manager, AG starts ranting to me about how he's never been a PAID member and will never become one, which suggests he will continue to scream at employees until he gets his way.

The MOD arrives about a minute later; he was on the opposite end of the store. Unfortunately for me, he's brand new to the store and isn't in my department (He's head of merchandising). My direct manager, who wouldn't have taken any of this, had left sick for the day.

&gt;MOD: What did you need?

AG goes on a rant, pretty much repeating everything he just said to me but emphasizing that *I* won't allow him to open another trial. MOD, not being familiar with our policies, tells me that it's fine to bypass it for the day, and AG's attitude changes like a light switch. He was so nice to me for the rest of the transaction that it was almost disturbing. For what it's worth, MOD did come back about 10 minutes later and apologize for making me put it through. I guess he realized how it made me look and it hopefully won't happen again.

AG had left with his new card, but I wasn't done investigating. Searching by driver's license only turned up one account, but looking up his name revealed that he had opened 5 free trials over the last 3 years and at multiple locations. My guess is he screams enough until someone snaps and just does it for him, but thankfully, I left a VERY long note for the customer service manager along with a screenshot of every membership number he's ever had. His driver's license and name have been flagged in our database for trial abuse. Hopefully, the poor employee he screams at next time will see that and refuse the sale.",TalesFromRetail

Later on, I had a gentleman pay another, older customer's purchase and thank him for his (military) service.

Then, I got called over to help a woman check if a rocking chair she was eager to buy could fit into her car. First two ladies came over and suggested another way of putting it in the trunk. It would have worked if the car's trunk lid would have had somewhere to attach a bungee cord. So she was thinking of trying to contact her daughter to borrow her car when two other women heard the conversation, and said they had a truck, and would drive the rocking chairs (turned out she wanted two of them) to her home!

I work as a cashier at a grocery store. Often times I have brief conversations with customers explaining taxes on certain items. Usually the deposit and levy on bottled/canned drinks. However, all prepared foods have taxes as well. Some people don't realize this, but are usually understanding when you explain things.

So, the following interaction took place between myself (M) and a dumb hick (DH) who apparently lived under a rock.

M: *rings up customer's deli roast chicken that we prepare in store* ""Your total today is $12.20.""

DH: ""But the sign on the warmer says $10.99.""

M: ""That's the price before taxes.""

DH: ""Taxes? Why the f**k are there taxes on chicken?!""

M: ""All prepared foods have taxes on them, as you are paying for convenience.""

DH: ""This is f**king bulls**t! Why the f**k should I pay taxes on a goddamn chicken?!""

M: ""Because we've already prepared it in store. You just have to take it home and eat it.""

DH: ""That's a f**king ripoff. Goddamn robbery. This is like the charge against Al Capone for his guns.""

M: ""Uhh...?""

DH: ""I shouldn't have to pay this.""

M: ""Sorry, guess you'll have to take it up with the government. Have a good evening.""

The man then wanders off, pissed about paying taxes on his prepared chicken, leaving me to serve the smarter customers now in my line. I still have no clue what he meant about Al Capone...",TalesFromRetail
t3_deu2fj,Escaped convicts in the mall!,"Last week was the most interesting day of work I’ve ever had. It started out like a typical Sunday. Slow traffic but there was 5 of us working so we were just trying to keep busy and helping out what customers we had. We get a phone call and one of my coworkers answers it and then says the call is for our store manager. So she goes up to answer it. I go over to help some customers out when over my radio I hear my store manager say “there’s a situation in the mall, get the customers out we need to evacuate” I didn’t know what the situation was but we usually only talk about what to do in the event of a mall shooting so I automatically assume that is what was about to go down. So I listen to the store manager and tell the two customers we had “hey there’s a situation in the mall, I don’t know what it is but we need to close the store and evacuate.” Luckily these two customers were good about it and dropped what they were carrying and left. I then ran up and shut the gate while my co workers ran in the back and grabbed our stuff to leave. I’m still freaking out trying to listen for gun shots (which thankfully never happened). Once my coworkers got back out from the back room we started to head out of the mall. My friend told me we were all going to my car since my trusty Mom van could fit all 5 of us in it. My store manager goes to run into other stores to tell them and their customers to get out and start evacuating as the fire alarm goes off. (Normally the whole mall ignores the fire alarm because it frequently goes off at random times for no reason at all) I get everyone out to my car, and once my store manager comes out and gets in the car too we drive off. We still weren’t entirely sure what was going on but we just knew we couldn’t be anywhere near the mall. So I took all my co workers in my falling apart Mom van and get us out. We were all panicked so I just drove us around the city and showed them all different places I knew about just to make the situation better. We started to get info that the reason we had to evacuate is that 4 escaped convicts from the next state over were sighted at our mall and were possibly dangerous. We drove around for two hours before we were able to drive back to the mall. During that time I took them to my college campus, and then to my house to pet dogs (which we all got paid to do btw) It got to the point where two of my coworkers would have finished their shift so we all just drove them home. On the way there we found out that the mall was safe and reopening. (We still don’t know why they thought it was a good idea to open since by that point it was almost time for the mall to close. On Sundays we aren’t open for long to begin with) But the 3 of us head back to the store to just finish the day thinking we wouldn’t be busy so we could just clean things for the last hour we were open. We were wrong. We were busier after the fact than we were before the convicts were sighted. So while I was getting alerts on my phone to stay inside and lock my doors because they were never actually caught, their were people taking their young children to the mall! The last place these people were seen! And at this point everyone knew why the mall was closed! But there were still people there! We weren’t super friendly with the customers that came in because by that point we were over it and just wanted to be home after the whole scare. We didn’t go out of our way to help them like we are normally supposed to do. Then I got a phone call from someone asking if I could do a price adjustment over the phone for them since the mall was closed earlier and no one would let her in. I told her I can’t do any kind of transaction over the phone and she was mad about that and I just apologized until she hung up. My store manager told me that I should have told her “yeah sorry that we were closed we had escaped convicts hiding in the mall.” It still baffles me that people tried to walk into the mall while it was surrounded by police, helicopters circling it, and employees from other stores that didn’t leave all standing on the hill and in the parking lot outside the mall. 


I did hear later about how they found out that the convicts were at the mall. Apparently after escaping, someone from the outside got them a car and they drove and ended up in our quiet area. A mall employee was outside smoking and they asked her to borrow her phone. She let them and then after they left she got a call from an unknown number saying that “hey the person who just let you borrow your phone is an escaped convict” so she then called the police. Apparently another one of the guys asked another mall employee for gas money and got denied. They later found clothing tags in a bathroom along with some of the clothing the guys had been previously wearing. And they were later captured another state over. Apparently this is the second time one of them escaped this month and one of the guys was driving his own car.

t3_dems2s,Excuse me while I bleed everywhere.,"This just happened about 30 minutes ago. Older gentleman, let's call him Bob, came into the store with a broken hurricane lamp. I work at a family owned lighting store that has been here for 75ish years so this is common. We have spare glass in the back for most fixtures. 

The glass had broken and there were several sharp edges. He asked if I could repair it so I went over to look at it, I notice he's holding his left hand. Then I notice the lamp is covered in blood, to the point it's dripping. I cannot stress this enough, I ***DO NOT*** like blood, but I can deal with it if someone's in danger. Plus, I know a few medical things thanks to my training in the Army. 

Bob proceeds to ask if we have a bandaid. I ask him to look at the cut (to gauge what size bandage he needs) and this thing is pouring blood. He lacerated a vein on the top of his hand. Bob proceeds to shake his hand spraying blood in various directions. 

After getting pressure reapplied to his wound, which he didn't want to do, he asked me to remove the blood covered, broken glass from this lamp. I walked into the back room, took a hammer, and smashed it getting the glass (and blood) into the trash can with his permission. Took what was left and dropped it off in his truck. Offered to drive him to the hospital but he declined.

Background: I work in the eCommerce department of a well known retail store.

Customers check in through an app or call to let us know they are here. We have a department cellphone that one person dispensing orders keeps on them. I had it at this time.

I was outside finishing up another customer's order when a second car pulls up. I walk over to make sure he's checked in so I can find his order and get it to him. As soon as I walk up to him he raises a finger and hushes me before I can speak. He has out his cellphone and I can already see where this is going.

Me: Sir, I can check you in, theres no need to call since I have the phone anyways.

Customer: Just let me call the number so I can get my groceries!

At this point the phone begins ringing in my pocket and he still has his finger up hushing me. 

Me: Umm, I have the phone so you'd just be talking to me anyways. I just need your name so I can check you in?

I grab the phone and show him his number coming through. I'd also like to mention he's smoking a pipe and just casually blows the smoke in my direction (this is actually infuriatingly common). At this point he's also looking visibly frustrated that no one is answering the phone.

Customer: I just wanted to call! I thought calling was anonymous! (what?) \*more incomprehensible muttering and anger\*. 

At this point I'm just silent waiting for him to hang up so that we could move on from this. He doesn't. He lets it go to voicemail. Looking back, I had the perfect opportunity to just answer and be a smart ass, but, I was too stunned in the moment to really do anything.

When it comes time to pay for the order, only one of the two guys is paying (PG, short for paying guy) and he wants it split between two separate cards. Okay, still no problems so far. Then PG gets a phone call before he can tell me how to split it. I don't hear the other end of the call, but the PG says ""I'm at the counter, about to pay as we speak."" I do hear a faint bit of yelling on the other end before PG asks ""Here, you want to talk to the guy at the counter?"" He then puts the phone up to me...

I hear a loud, raspy female voice on the other end. I mean, she's just straight up YELLING. I couldn't make out anything she was saying for the life of me. It all sounded like muddled, unintelligible garbage. Despite this, I know for a fact that none of this is directed at me. She's trying to yell at PG, who I assumed was her husband. I try to tell her that she's not actually yelling at PG anymore, but the words are completely frozen in my throat. PG asks me ""Is she yelling at you?"" I'm just like ""Um, I think she's trying to yell at you."" PG takes the phone back and tells her ""You're yelling at me while he's on the phone? Goodbye, &lt;wife's name&gt;"" and then just hangs up. The only reaction I can muster at this point is ""Is that normal?""

t3_deitav,A shirt conundrum,"About two weeks ago I was at the counter of my family all around art shop while my brother was busy with a customer in the sterilized area and couldn't answer the phone.

The customer I was helping was being a bit difficult and refused to answer my questions about his t-shirt order and decided to go over my head to the owner of the business as, I quote, ""I got tha head owner's number right here, his personal cell phone I'll have you know. I'll just give him a ring and we'll see what he says about you being stupid.""

He called my brother, who was in the other room wearing sterile gloves, and followed the sound of the ringing to the Bluetooth speaker sitting on our T-shirt stand my brother has connected to his personal cell phone, which is also the shop phone and plays music through.

He was completely baffled while I popped over to where my brother was and explained.

Agitated my brother removed his gloves, desanitized and walked over to the guy to see what his deal was.

He wound up telling my brother he wanted my brother to put a picture on a shirt that was an original character of a local artist's comic book but didn't want to buy the actual merch from the original artist who was struggling to get his name out there.

My brother kicked him out, told him if he wanted something else he would have to schedule an appointment, not to come back until his appointment, then sterilized again and got back to work while I reorganized the t-shirts display the guy had trashed looking for the phone that was ringing.",TalesFromRetail
t3_degwb1,“The line forms here!”,"Hey all I’m back with another tale! This one is about when customers can’t read the big sign saying “line forms here!”...Wellup here we go! 

So at my store, each register location is different...at mine register location, we have four registers with one “line forms here” sign and the typical black divider thing, it’s pretty simple and easy to see but people still get it wrong. 

We can only two registers because the other two are on the other side and people tend to line up behind the person, when there is a line with other people waiting. One day I was ringing this lady up at the register next to where the “line forms here” sign was, it’s going fine when these two ladies come up and stand on the side of the register. 

I ask them if they need help because that’s what some people do sometimes, they say that they are waiting to be checked out and I direct to where the line was...they say that no one is there so they continue to stand there and talk loudly while I’m ringing up my customer. I’m getting annoyed while trying to have this interaction with my customer. 

After I’m done ringing up my customer, I see there is another lady who goes where the sign was and asks us for help with something. She was in the store earlier for a payment so we had to clear up some confusion. As I’m doing that, the two ladies put their things on the previous register counter and wait.

After I’m done clearing up the confusion, I call them over...one of them says something under their breath about why they need to go over there, I smile and give my best retail voice and personality as I’m ringing them up just to annoy them.",TalesFromRetail
t3_deckj2,The stress ball attacker,"I used to be a cashier at a well known drugstore few years ago, and we have little impulse buy items on display near the registers. This is where our story starts.

I was helping out a different customer, and I was faced away from the impulse buys. We had a whole box of those popular stress balls shaped like food. So I'm completing this transaction, all is going well and I was soon to go home, so pretty hyped. 

All of a sudden, I feel pain on the side of my face. My first instinct: ""I'm getting robbed"". Also side note, I had just gotten an ear piercing as well on that side, so it really felt great. I turned my head towards the source, and there is a man, who looks to be around mid 30's, laughing his ass off. I looked on the ground next to me and there was the source, a little chocolate cupcake stress toy, meant to relieve stress, and just ended up causing so much more.

The man comes up and says, ""Hey, I'm sorry about that, you just looked so bored up there and I wanted to add some excitement to your day"". 

Guys. This man thought that by chucking a toy at the high school cashiers face, that her day would be brightened and she would have a laugh along with him

I wish this was the part of the story where I say that I told him off, kicked him out of the store, and everybody clapped.

That did not happen. See, I was a very timid 17 year old who just wanted him to leave, so I quickly finished the transaction and he left.

While I was visiting on their last day in the hospital the in room phone rings and he makes to pick it up, stops and sighed, then answered it like a normal person.

He answered the question the staff had and when he hung up he sort of grinned sheepishly and said ""I had to stop and breathe a second, I almost answered it with (shop name) how can I help you? And I didn't want anyone here to realize who I am while we're in here.""

We have a desk area on the sales floor that has a computer and a few other things there. The amount of people who think it's a register is kind of astounding, but that's not really the point of this story even though that's how it began. I was standing at this computer with my scanner looking up stuff in our system to update out of stocks in my department when a man came up.

Me - ""Hello, can I help you with anything today?""

Him - ""yes, I'd like to check out""

Me - ""oh, I'm sorry, this isn't a register but there's one just over this way."" I indicate the direction of the nearest register.

Him - ""oh, ok, you know, my kid works here.""

Me - ""That's nice, it's a good job, I've been here a while. Who is that? I might know them.""

Him - ""(name I don't know)""

Me - ""I don't know that person, but I'll keep an eye out for them and say hi if I see them.""

Him - ""you know, *kid* lives with me. I can't remember their phone number for their card, can you look it up?"" He indicates the computer I'm at.

Me - ""I'm sorry, I don't have access to other employees phone numbers and that isn't something we would be allowed to give to a customer even if I did.""

Him - ""why not? They are my kid.""

Me - ""I cannot confirm that in any way.""

Him - ""I have id"" he starts to pull out his wallet.

Me - ""I'm sorry, but I still wouldn't be able to confirm that *name* is your child. Are they working today? You could find them and...""

Me - ""I'm sorry.""

Him - ""I want to talk to a manager.""

Me - ""I am the acting manager on shift today.""

Him - ""I want a reeeaaaaallll manager"" (yes, he said it like that)

Him - (interrupting) ""I'm (kid)'s FAAAATTTTHHHHEEERRRRR!!! I WANT THE NUMBER!!!!""

Him - ""DON'T IGNORE ME! GET OFF THE PHONE!""

Me into phone - ""hi (name) it's queenfrankie420 in (department). I have a customer over here at (location) and he's asking to speak to a manager. (My manager) is on lunch and not in the store right now, could you possibly come over?""

t3_ddxibw,"Well, if the shoe fits...","I know this has happened 5 hours ago, but this still pisses me off to no end. Since I live in a college town where I work, football Saturday is *cuh-raaaaaazy*, not to mention a little headache-inducing. So, we had a woman who was in her early-to-mid-twenties (we'll call her Almighty Queen Bee...or AQB for short) come in to buy a few things, and I went to cash her out...when I forgot to ring up her drink. 

*Dammit.*

So, I asked her if the drink was hers as well.

&gt; AQB: Uhh, YEAH? Why didn't you scan it the first time?

&gt; Me: I'm sorry, ma'am, I just didn't see it. I thought it was the woman's right behind you.

&gt; AQB: *(scoffs)* Whatever.

Everything was going okay for a minute until I went to give her the receipt the way that I give receipts to all people: in a gentle, yet firm way so nobody would forget it, she goes and says this:

&gt; AQB: Okay...what was THAT?!

&gt; Me: Um...what was what? 

&gt; AQB: The way you gave me that receipt? You know, I was gonna bite my tongue about you, but this is fucking ridiculous. 

&gt; Me: *(confused)* Anh? 

&gt; AQB: *(absolutely fuming now)* YOU SHOVED THE RECEIPT INTO MY HANDS. WHAT AM I TO YOU, THE LOWEST SCUM OF THE EARTH OR SOMETHING??? 

And that's when the woman right behind her (we'll call her Awesomely Snarky Customer, or ASC for short) started murmuring under her breath.

&gt; ASC: *(mumbles)* Well, if the shoe fits...

Ohhhh, I was half-wishing for her not to hear that. Fuuuu...too late. 

&gt; AQB: What did you just say?

&gt; ASC: *(completely stonefaced)* Nothing. 

And with that, she lost it and just before storming out, she left us with this beautiful sentiment...

&gt; AQB: *(flipping the whole store off)* FUCK YOU! 

And to make matters worse, the way she swung the door open on her way out, you'd think the door would fall straight off the hinges. I, the woman behind her, and her friend just looked at each other like, ""What the ever loving fuck?"" and started laughing. 

&gt; ASC: *(laughing)* I was gonna bite my tongue about *her*, but...*(imitating AQB)* that was fucking ridiculous!

Ohhhh, I almost felt terrible for bursting out laughing then, but that pepped me up to the point that I almost forgot about it. All this time I was scanning ASC's items, we talked for a little bit and she reassured me that what'd happened was nothing to worry about.

t3_ddomxu,I WANT IT ON MY CARD— Oh wait.,"As a cashier I process several refunds a day. I’ll generally get some sketchy ones and some normal ones. There was one I processed fairly recently that was beyond sketchy. Let me explain something first though.

The company I work for processes returns by scanning a barcode that comes printed on the bottom of EVERY receipt. We scan the barcode, then the item (if it matches up with the receipt) and input the return price of said item. After the return is finished, you may purchase other items in exchange or get the negative amount back in whatever way you paid with (except checks— that’s another story). 

Now this is what’s REALLY confusing. If you return an item at a different store in exchange for another item at that same store but you go to an entirely different store to return that exchanged item, you’re stacking returns. The money coming back on that second return will go on a gift card instead of what you paid with in the first exchange. Why the registers do it this way, I’ll never know. If you know, please enlighten me. 

Anyway I had a guy give me a receipt from another store with a returned wheelchair on the top for $149.99. In exchange for this wheelchair, he bought a walker worth $129.99. Mind you this exchange took place at an entirely different store.

So he wanted to return the walker he just bought in an exchange. I said “okay” and processed it. As I mentioned earlier, whenever items are double stacked like this in a return, the difference will go back on a gift card. He went into a hissy fit saying:

 “Oh my wife will kill me if I bring back a gift card. Can’t you just give me cash or just put the difference back on my debit card?”

I sighed and told him: “No sir we can’t. The way these transactions are set up, whenever returns are double stacked like this, the register forces us to put the difference back on a gift card regardless of what you used to pay before.”

He pulled the classic line: “Let me speak to your manager!”

I called a manager over and they were dumbfounded. They’d never heard of “stacked returns” before and tried voiding the whole transaction. The manager processed the entire thing the same way I did and didn’t understand why the register did what it did. 

This guy kept insisting we just put the difference back on his card. We kept saying no and he was getting angrier and sweatier. As soon as the manager mentioned that he could use the gift card at any of our other branches, he went:

“Oh I can? Cool! That works out then!”

He then walks away with gift card in hand and acting satisfied.

I’m sorry WHAT? 

A manager mentions something that should probably be common knowledge based on how much he “shops here”. The only thing that can satisfy him is a managers decision?

t3_ddwcu4,“Can I Get Some Change?”,"So something happened at the retail store I work at today that I want to share.

I was behind the cashier counter and a woman comes in, holding two $20 bills, and asked me if I was the manager as she needed change. I’m thinking that’s she’s a worker from another store in the mall I work in. I was not the manager so I called for our new sales lead that was on the floor, as our store manager and co-manager were in the back room, and sales leads are technically managers of the store when the co-manager or store manager aren’t around or there at the store. The sales leads at our store also have the ability to open the cash register when it’s not for a purchase, and I was thinking that she had already been trained to do so even though she was relatively new. The lady told her that she needed change and our new sales lead then went to the back to ask if we could even give her the change. Like I said before, the woman was holding two $20 bills asking for change. She was asking for either twenty $1 bills.......or twenty $5 bills as twenty $5 bills equal $20, or something along that line because in my head I though “twenty $5 bills does not equal $20, four does 🤔.” Heck it doesn’t even equal $40 since she had two $20 bills. But I didn’t say that out loud lol. Our new sales came back and told her that we wouldn’t be able to give her change and she just walks out the store without saying anything. How rude.

I asked our new sales lead what did they say when she asked if they could give the woman change and she said “We aren’t a bank”. I immediately knew that it was our co-manager that answered with that lol. And honestly she’s right because we need our money in order to give change to customers who are purchasing their items with cash or are doing cash returns. Plus it turns out that the woman wasn’t an employee from another store, just a regular person roaming the mall, so we definitely couldn’t give her change.

I was just stuck on the fact that she literally said that twenty $5 bills would be the change for $20. You know how sometimes a person says something that makes you go “what?” in your head? That was one of those situations lol. told my mom about it sometime after I got home and she told me that she was probably trying to get more money from us. Maybe she was right.",TalesFromRetail
t3_ddko95,"""Where do you go to pick up online orders?""","This is my first post but I felt this story was interesting enough to be shared. So I work at a grocery store, and I stand at the door all day which means I answer the questions of every customer coming in with one. This couple came in and asked me a very simple question, ""Where do you go to pick up online orders?""

Now, the self checkout is in front of my door but to the right a little; if you look straight ahead you'll see all the way to the other side of the store to a set of doors leading to the back. If you look straight ahead and to up a little, you'll see a sign saying ""Pickup ➡.""

So, naturally, I pointed to the sign. ""Pickup is that way.""

The customer looked ahead, but not up. ""So... We go to the back of the store?""

""No, see the sign? Right there?""

""Are you saying we go to the back to pick up online orders?""

""No, no,"" At this point I had realized they hadn't and were not going to see the sign, so I pointed in the same direction it was pointing. ""Pickup is over there.""

I have forgotten their exact words by now, this was a few months ago, but the couple kept on asking if it was in the back and not really listening to me, until they decided to go ask another employee by self checkout for clarification.
I could hear them say that I ""don't know where pickup is"" and ""as an employee she should know where it is.""

As soon as they were gone, my coworker came up to me and was like ""You know, pickup is--""

""I know where pickup is. I was pointing at the sign there,"" I pointed at the sign, ""and when they still didn't understand I pointed that way,"" I pointed to the right, ""but they would not listen to me.""

And that was that.

Except it wasn't.

So then I get another coworker a few minutes later trying to tell me where the pickup is, amd I have that exact conversation, again.

And again. Except when the third coworker came up to me, as I was explaining to her that the customers weren't listening to me, one of the customers came up and apologized to me because she ""wasn't aware it was my first day."" I'd been there for a week. Anyway, after that people stopped bothering me about pickup.

The worst part of it is that pickup is right along the wall. You walk in, turn right and there it is. You can't miss it.

t3_dddmre,"""Are you calling my son a liar?!""","Obligatory 'on mobile, first time posting', etc

So I work in a store that sells video games and accessories, and our returns policy is that if something is still sealed, we'll return it within thirty days. If it's unsealed and after thirty days, we can only return the item if there is a fault with it.

A woman comes in today with one of our own-brand headsets, saying that she bought it a couple of weeks ago and her son doesn't think that the sound quality is very good. My co-worker, we'll call her Jenny, politely tells this woman that we cannot return the headset unless there is an actual fault. Store policy. The customer, a Karen, then tells Jenny that ""there is a fault! The sound quality isn't good! It's crackly!""

Our own-brand headsets aren't great, I will admit that, but with headsets you often get what you pay for.

Jenny goes out back and tests this headset, as we do with all ""faulty"" items, and when she comes back and tells Karen that the headset sounds fine and that we can't return it, as expected, Karen does not like this.

She goes on to ask whether she can have her money back on a gift card, Jenny says no, company policy states that we cannot return an item unless it is faulty. Karen then accuses Jenny of calling her son a liar, refusing to entertain the idea that there might be a problem elsewhere with her son's console, i.e. his controller, his connection, etc. Jenny is calm during this, being polite and respectful, but Karen is having none of it. ""You're just calling my son a liar! Why would you call a fourteen-year-old a liar?""

Then my boss steps in; he (thank god) backs Jenny up, tells Karen the same thing Jenny told her, even when Karen brings out the ""so you'd rather lose a customer?"" card.

I don't really know how to finish this lol, but Karen eventually left, without her refund, after accusing us of taking advantage of children.

The other day towards the beginning of my shift we got a call from a lady saying she lost a bank envelope with $1000 cash and thought it was in a shoebox she returned. We still had the cart with return items so boss and I found the shoebox and looked. Nothing. Those were the only shoes that matched the description. Boss apologized to her that we didn't find it. The lady didn't freak out too hard because she assumed that meant it HAD to be in her car.

Later that night I got another call from her sounding defeated. She had spent a few more hours looking for it with no luck. Everything had been sent to be restocked at this point so all I could do was take down her name and number for the slim chance someone found it and turned it in. There wasn't a lot of hope in either side of that conversation and I was sure that would be the end I heard of it.

In the last half hour of my shift today that had been swamped with payday craziness up walks a lady. She says she's been talking with our head of security and someone from corporate security, mentioning them both by name, and I should have an envelope with $1000 cash for her. I blurted ""Oh my God they found it?!?"" Before backtracking to explain I was the one on the phone so knew the shoebox saga. 

It ended up not being in my locked drawer so I had to get my boss (same one from the other day) to track it down. She was equally shocked, but got it handled and back to the lady.

Now this has never happened in my two years of selling soap.

One of them picks up one of the maple leafs and smells of it. I go to tell her about what it's made out of, as I usually do because of skin sensitivity, and before I can say anything she just chomped it; plastic wrap and all.

I thought she would spit it out at least. She chewed and swallowed it, then turned to me complain it wasn't maple flavored.

I was dumbfounded. I told her she would still have to pay for it and she complained about it not being very good, but I managed to get her to pay for it before they both left.

t3_dd3hm4,For The Love of Jolly Ranchers,"Alright, so this happened about 3 hours ago, and I'm starting to think this is the scariest, funniest, and infuriating thing that's ever happened to me all at once. So, we just got through clearing up the crowds in our store, and we're getting ready to lock up and do some maintenance cleaning and recovery when all of a sudden I hear knocking on the glass. There was a man that looked to be in his mid-twenties, so we'll go ahead and call him Grown Man (GM). I'll explain why his title maybe a little (or a lot) erroneous. 

&gt; GM: Excuse me, Miss! Hey, excuse me! Open up, please!

&gt; Me: *mouths* I'm sorry, we've already closed.

&gt; GM: Come oooon, maaaan! I just need to get something in there real quick, PLEASE!

&gt; Me: *(shaking head)* I really am sorry, Sir. We're closed.

&gt; GM: *(a little louder this time, banging on the door)* COME OOOOON, PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! 

And that's when I shouted to my cool manager (CM) to come up front and tell this *boy* that we are closed, FOR REAL. 

&gt; CM: I really am sorry, Sir. We're closed for the time being, but we open tomorrow at 6 am if you wanna come back.

&gt; GM: *(starting to sound pitiful now)* COME OOOOOOOOON, PLEEEEASE! PLEASE OPEN UP! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! I JUST NEED TO GET ME SOME JOLLY RANCHERS REAL QUICK, PLEASE!

Ohhh, hold on a second, WHAT? All this ado...over JOLLY RANCHERS? CM and I looked at each other like he's completely lost it. I mean, there are 3 or 4 gas stations that are open around here that have Jolly Ranchers...but no. He wants to buy them from us...RIGHT AS WE'RE CLOSING. But he was just so dang pitiful that we had to open the door for him to get them or else he'll be there whining all night. And just like that, he finally paid for his Jolly Ranchers without a ""thank you"" or anything...but a sneered ""Some real women you both are. Bitches.""

Cue another dumbfounded glance shared between CM and I. It pissed off CM, but it scared *me* just a little. What if we kept him hanging like that? Would he go completely belligerent than he was then? We don't know. But now, it's sort of funny because as we were cleaning up and getting ready to head home after the whole ordeal, we had to shake our heads and laugh as we looked back on that encounter and think, ""Wow...a grown man throwing a fit...*over some Jolly Ranchers.*""",TalesFromRetail
t3_dcpzqd,Our monthly customer at the supplement store.,"I thought about this story not long ago and really wanted to share a more wholesome retail story.

I used to work at a small supplement store back when I first started college. We sold your usual vitamins and supplements as well as protein powders, workout supplements, essential oils, medicine, that kind of stuff.

We had this regular customer, let’s call him Albert, who came into the store about once a week. He was an older, retired gentleman whose wife was kind of sickly. He’d come every single month, around the same time, with a little red paper folder filled with pictures of the exact vitamins and medicines he needed to get for her. He’d show me a picture, we’d walk to where it was together, and do that about 3 more times, then he’d pay, leave a little peppermint candy for every person working that day, and leave. Then we’d see him again next month just like clockwork. He liked to tell the staff stories about all the places him and his wife have visited (he had no kids so him and his wife traveled the world for quite a few years). I loved this customer, everything he did was just adorable. And we knew whenever Albert was gonna grace us with his presence because this adorable, tiny old man drove a sweet red Ferrari. Bless you, sir. We all need an Albert in our retail careers.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dd1ris,Apparently the store I work in is a good place to sell drugs.,"So I usually work late night Thursday, because in Australia shops are open till late on Thursday’s. 
Well this particular Thursday seemed like it was going to be a really calm and quiet night. Little did I know apparently there was a drug deal going on in the store. 

There was a lady, two men and around two children. One of the men had nothing to do with the other man and the children but the lady was apparently buying drugs off him. 

Obviously we were not aware of this until the other man had a massive outburst and was screaming at the lady saying he was going to “f*cking kill her” and that “she was never going to see her kids again”. This man pushed his children out the store while continually yelling “ I’m going to f*cking kill you c*nt” and kept coming back to try and fight the other man. He was also yelling things like “you did it in front of the children, you’ve f*cking done it this time c*nt”. And when the kids left the store they threw down what they wanted to buy and said “quick let’s get out of here while we still can”. 

We called security but when I asked the lady if she was okay she told me that was her ex and he was crazy and if he comes back we should call the police. The security officer removed him from the store and the kids came back afterwards and bought nerf guns. 

We don’t really know what happened and what happened after that but the other man left a little while later and we assumed he was the dealer. 
(The reason we know it was a drug deal was because as the man left he said it to the lady at the front) 

So much for a quiet Thursday night.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dckzov,"""Can I get cash back?""","So I am a customer service manager at a grocery chain store. I was getting ready to leave for the day but still needed to help a cashier print something out, so I was waiting for her at the service desk (located right outside the office we needed to be in). 

The cast in the story is: Me-Me, Cashier 1- A, Cashier 2 - B, My fellow manager- CSM, Customer - C, Customer's Friend- CF

While I'm waiting for A to come up to the office, C walks up to the desk holding a pack of sunflower seeds.

C- ""Can I get cash back?""

Me- ""Yes, you can get cash back.""

C- ""Can I get just ten dollars?""

Me- ""No, twenty is the minimum.""

C- ""I can't get just ten?""

Me- ""No, it won't give you the option for less than twenty, but I can break down the twenty for you.""

C- ""So I couldn't get just ten?""

Me- ""I can do an unload on your card, but that has a $3.74 fee on it.""

C- ""I'll just do the twenty.""

Me- ""Okay.""



I log into the register and scan her sunflower seeds, then her friend comes up to her with a gallon of milk.

Me- ""Did you want to purchase this too?"" *Gestures to the milk.*

C and CF continue talking.

Me- ""Did you want to purchase the milk too?""

C- ""Not right now.""

Me- ""Okay. That'll be 52 cents.""

C- ""That's sixty."" *Hands me sixty cents.*

Me, slightly confused, cashes her out- ""Eight cents is your change.""

C- ""Oh, I was gonna get cash back."" 

Me- ""You have to use your card to get cash back.""

C- ""Okay."" Walks away.


By this point, my cashier had come up to the desk, so we go into the office to print out her papers. Then B calls me from the self check out.


B- ""Hey, there's a customer out here that said she paid for her sunflower seeds at the desk.""

Me- ""Yes, she did.""

B- ""Okay."" 


B hangs up, but then immediately call me back.


B- ""She said she's missing her cash back.""

Me- ""She has to use her card to get cash back. She paid cash, so she didn't get any.""

B- ""Okay.""


I finish helping A print her papers, so I come out of the office and walk up to the self check out podium where B is standing with C and CSM.


CSM- ""Do you have her receipt? She said she doesn't have it.""

Me- ""Yeah, I have it up there. I'll go get it.""


I walk back to the service desk and get her receipt out of the trash can. I turn and see that she had followed me, so I hand it to her. She then walks back to the self check out and speaks with CSM again. I walk back over because I can tell this isn't over.


CSM- ""Can you give her a refund? She wants to refund it to buy it again for cash back.""

Me- ""Okay, but you have to use your card to get cash back.""

C- ""Yeah, I was going to, but you just rang it up and did whatever you wanted.""


And I'm just standing there, like??? You gave me money to pay for your item. What did you expect me to do with that?? If you have me money, I am going to tell the register that you gave me money. But I just tell her that I can refund her at the service desk.


So we go up to the desk and I give her the $0.52 back. She takes the money and starts walking away.


Me- ""Do you want to ring it up for cash back?""

C, with an attitude- ""I'm going to do it over here at self checkout.""


I just thought to myself that the self check out is only going to give you a twenty back, and we won't be able to break that down for you, but okay.


I immediately clocked out and came home to rant to my roommates about her. I just don't understand where her confusion came from, and how she was going to blame me for cashing her out when she gave me money.


Tl;dr: Woman hands me money for her purchase, then gets mad at me for cashing her out when she wanted cash back.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dcch7u,"""Ill pay in cash""","LTL, FTP, etc etc.

I used to work as a cashier at a regional grocery store chain as a summer job this happened during a morning shift one day.

I was waiting around for a customer near my register when this guy rolls up with two carts full of groceries. No big deal but I knew I would be there for a while.

After I scanned all of his two carts worth of groceries it totaled somewhere just under 300 dollars worth.

I asked the generic cash or card question and he said cash and proceeded to hand me a massive stack of one dollar bills.

Knowing this was a ""unique"" case I called over my manager and we began counting and bundling the money to make sure he had enough. After counting the customer was still short another 100 dollars or so.

After telling the customer he was short he said he would ""be right back"" and about three or so minutes later came back into the store with another stack of ones.

After counting *those* he was still short like 50 bucks and we had to painstakingly go through his items and remove stuff he didn't need badly.

Thankfully it was early in the morning so he didn't hold up a line of people or anything and he was a nice enough dude.

My real question is why did he have so many ones? Where do you get that many? Money laundering?? I will never know.

t3_dcenz8,The time I outsmarted a shoplifter at the fitting rooms,"So this happened a while back (maybe 6 months ago?) and I was still quite new to the job - definitely the newest store associate. 

Part of our standard practices is to *physically* check all items of clothing entering the fitting room although most associates do not do this out of fear that the customer feels accused, guilty, offended etc. Not me, I don't care. 

Now, if you work in retail, I'm pretty sure that you have had some sort of induction training and part of that is how to prevent/deter thefts without putting yourself in danger, without alerting/confronting the thief and safely too. 

Here's the story of how I did all of this to perfection (after the bold writing, the story is over, I'm just typing extra stuff after that:

**It was busy, on a Saturday. And I actually have a queue at the fitting room of about 5 people. The first guy comes up to me with 6 items (I even remember the number of items he had). But, he looks shifty in his body language, immediately I knew something was off about him. He looked smart though. He wore glasses, dressed well, looked about mid-20's and just looked innocent.**

**I count his items in, gave him a number tag for 6 items. He quickly takes it all from me and I told him ""Wait..."". I took a thick zipped hoodie off of him, unzipped the jumper and what do ya know? A Ralph Lauren shirt had been double-hung in the hoodie!! I then turned to him and said ""Do you want to try this on too?"" He said yes and I changed his tag to 7 items. He was embarrassed. The other customers looked at me just surprised that someone tried to pull this off, they definitely would have gone home to tell their SO about this.**

Ralph Lauren items are one of our most expensive brands in store. The ways I noticed it is by his body language, I knew he weren't about to switch the price tickets because he just seemed too smart for that. I also noticed the inside label of the jumper wasn't the same brand as the actual jumper and of course, the jumper seemed quite heavy. It was him who did it because the size of the shirt matched the sizes of everything else he had. He would have detagged that in the FR (they're really cheap to buy on eBay nowadays), stuffed it in his pocket (easy to do with a shirt) and walked out after dumping the security tag in the store somewhere, likely under a gondola. 

Others who work in stores with fitting rooms. The fitting room is a prime location for shoplifting. It is also a first point of contact for customers to interact with staff and develop an opinion of the store based on the staff interaction there. There are ways you can discreetly search an item of clothing quickly and the customer may notice, but it's better done discreetly and quickly than obnoxiously and to prove a point. In this instance, I didn't say ""Why are you stealing?"". I probably deterred this guy from trying it ever again and I remained professional about it too, other customers noticed this and it would have created a lasting, positive impression of my service to them. At the same time, I couldn't have done this without other customers noticing what I just did so my professionalism was integral. Remember, you can always deter theft and still provide a good customer service. My managers loved me after this.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dckjp8,I gave you a deal but okay,"I'm going to make this short.

I sell fish and it goes by weight. But if it's a recipe, it will go by unit. 

So:

WEIGHT: Salmon: $5/LBS

UNIT: Salmon into Spinach Roll: $6.99 PER ROLL 

Which means if you want a ROLL you will be paying $6.99. Doesn't matter how much it weighs.

A customer tried to argue with me today. ""Oh but what is the price per weight?""

I explained that for a recipe we don't count the weight and go by unit. He was having none of this. ""But what's the weight? How much in kilograms? How much in pounds? That doesn't sound right! It should be less!""

 Finally I gave up.  I didn't care to have a bad day so I basically said ""Here you are sir, TWO recipes for the price of one!"" (I gave him both of the recipes for $6.99 even though the total was over $13)

 . . . He comes back and asks for another 2 salmon rolls. Like do you really think I'm this stupid? I was just being nice. I give him the next two salmon rolls for full price.  $13 bucks. 

""Oh you charged me too much! $13 dollars??""

""Yup. The full amount. Because it goes by unit and not weight. It's what I've been telling you""

""  . ..  but, but? ""  
""No just walk away. Bye""

t3_dck955,I somehow ruined a customers day.,"A couple of years ago I worked in a retailor selling everyday goods such as food, clothes and much more. 

I was working a normal part-time 4-9 pm. shift on a Friday.  When later in the evening, around 7-8 pm. enters a customer. (woman in her late 40)  Asking if we had any more left of a particular red wine that was a Friday only sale. I tell the customer to give me a few minutes as I go down to the store basement where we keep the stock and check our 4 big pallets with wine. Sadly for the customer, there's no red wine, but a lot of white and rosé. Then I come to think of a pallet standing at the front of the store packed with the same brand that was on sale that day, and I immediately call our customer service to check if there were any red wines left on that pallet. But then again, no red but a lot of red and rosé. 

I then walk out to the customer and bring her the sad news that, since she got here late there were no red wine left of that brand to such a good price but politely suggest that we have white wine or rosé of the same brand for the same price. She doesn't want the white or rosé and is set to get the red wine, to which I again politely tell her that we're out of stock. At first, she seems to accept that she go to the store late, and we were all out of stock. Again I apologise to her and say the goodbyes, but the goodbye is what has been puzzling me for years now, and still is to this day. the conversation went as followed

Me: I'm sad to inform you that we're all out of the red wine

Customer: Yeah, okay.

Me: But I do certainly hope that you have a wonderful evening nonetheless

 Customer: Well, I can't have a good evening now that you've ruined it all for me.

I work at a popular grocery store in New Zealand, in a small town with a large retirement village, which means that a large population of this little town is old people. And old people seem to invade the grocery store after their favourite old-people activities: Like golf, and yelling at the poor min-wage employee.

So, it begins with me, I stock the shelves on the aisles that need to be stocked (all of them) today I was working down the aisle which contained Pasta, Soups, and Sauces. I was stocking the shelves from my trolley of boxes, and OL approaches me asking where *x* item was, with a smile I told her the location of the item, and that was that. Or so I thought, because two minutes later, C comes around the corner with OL in tow, she asks me if I can find '*x*' for this lady. She cuts C off by saying ""Don't speak to him, he's useless."" Totally ignoring that bombshell, I tell C where the item is found, and that seemed to be the end of it.

t3_dcc335,It's not in the back,"The classic 'can you just check the back'.

I'm an assistant manager at a fairly well known shoe store. We work a 2/2 coverage so there's only 2 people working at any time. Near the end of my closing shift it gets BUSY. And while the front is packed with customers that the other manager is handling, I'm running around trying to finish putting away 30+ boxes of shipment that we got for the day, switching styles on the floor, and doing shoe fill. Clearly very busy, and trying to avoid eye contact with customers. 

A couple comes in and spends the whole time in our clearance section that is just a shelf of display shoes. If they need a size, we have to go track it down for them. 

It was starting to clear out at that point and the other manager wasn't nearly as busy as me. Of course, the couple keeps yelling for me to go grab sizes for them. (By sizes, I mean they just say ""something smaller""). It's fine, I'm quick and it doesn't take up too much time. We only have one other size for each of the shoes they want anyway because it's years old stuff we're trying to get rid of. 

When I bring them out, I very clearly tell them that it's the only size we have apart from the too big display shoes. One fits, the other is a size too big. They spend the next half hour with the girl walking around in the big shoes and yelling ""please, a smaller size"" at me. I had to go back FIVE TIMES and make a show of looking for a shoe that doesn't exist. Each time I come back and remind them it's the last pair because they're old and we don't make them any more. 

Ended up having to stay way late, and they bought the big shoes. (I heard them ask the other manager for another size as well at checkout).

t3_dc42gn,Woman doesn't understand how check lane dividers work.,"I had finished with the people in front of this Weird Woman by the time she was ready to place her items on the belt.  
Despite me having a line, she walked nearly all the way up to my register before starting to empty her cart. (Which means if the person behind her, like 97% of customers, is dumb enough to not understand how a moving belt works, then I'm going to end up getting their groceries mixed in with Weirdo's groceries. *thankfully this doesn't happen*) She apparently fully expected someone else to put their items on the belt, too! She had maybe 2 items on the belt and then put a divider behind her items.

I start scanning, and like the belt does, everything moves forward. I grab the divider and place it back in it's notch and continue scanning.  
Weirdo still has ~10 items in her cart when she grabs another divider, places it on the belt and then places items behind it.  
So, I hit ""total"" and tell her: ""okay, so the first total is $23.67.""  
Weirdo snaps: ""What are you talking about? It's all together!""  
Me: ""Oh, then why did you place the divider on the belt?""  
Weirdo snaps: ""It was a **mistake**!""

*sheesh lady, I'm not the one using things incorrectly*  

During the brief ""convo"" I finished scanning the rest of her items and gave her the full total. She paid without a fuss, but seemed to be radiating anger all the way up to her leaving.

t3_dcfbh2,The Crazy Man and the Ouija Board,"About a year ago at work, we had sold a Ouija board to a group of kids. They were around 12-13 years old. They had pooled their money together to buy it, and they were excited to use it.

Not ten minutes later, an older man comes storming into our store demanding to speak with our manager. She wasn’t there that day so our ASM took over. The man began yelling at him over selling the Ouija board, especially to kids.

That’s when we noticed he had the board in his hands (opened) and the kids were by the door looking scared. The man continued to yell saying he had lost family members to the board, that he was an apostle, and that he would get our store shut down for selling Ouija boards. He demanded we tell our corporate to never sell these again, and he would be back to make sure.

He threw the board onto the counter and left. The kids came in and explained that they had gone down to the food court and were going to use it, but the man came out of nowhere and started yelling at them about how it’s evil and he took the board from them and demanded to know where they bought it at.

The ASM was willing to refund them their money (even though it was against store policy to due cash returns), since they didn’t want the board anymore. They didn’t want to do the return and said they would see if one of their brothers/cousins ( I don’t remember which) would take it; but left it at the store. We held it for several days but no one came for it.

Luckily we haven’t had to deal with that man again despite occasionally seeing him in the mall. I still feel bad for those kids losing their money like that, as our store manager ended up damaging out the board after a week.

t3_dbujvy,You’re not my servant,"First post here - an older story from when I was a bagger at a grocery store. Dialogue is approximate at best.

It’s customary for the baggers at my store to ask people wih larger orders if they need help bringing their purchases to their cars. Generally you’d ask as you finish bagging the order, after the cashier has finished taking payment so there’s no interrupting going on.

Well, one day I was bagging a large order and was waiting for my turn to speak. The customer (let’s say Sally) was actively chatting with the cashier, so I wasn’t keen on interrupting. Then without missing a beat, Sally turns to look at me. She uses the flattest, least friendly voice possible when speaking to me, a far cry from how she addressed the cashier.

Sally: “You’re going to help me out, *right*?”
Me: “Of course.”
Sally: “That’s what I tought.”

I was a bit taken aback, but it was hardly the worst I had dealt with. Until I start to follow her out with the cart of groceries. You see, our front end is very busy during prime time and there’s only enough room for two people side by side. So in the interest of not blocking opposite traffic, people walk single file. We didn’t even make it 10 steps before Sally stops, turns around, and gives me a stink eye.

Sally: “Don’t walk behind me. You’re not my servant!”
Me: “Sorry, miss. I’m just following you.”
Sally: “Well don’t stand right behind me.”
Me: “Ma’am, there’s no room to walk anywhere else but behind you.”

She seemed satisfied with that answer and kept walking. Once we got to her car, she made it abundantly clear that I was to place the bags in a very specific manner in her trunk. She would roll her eyes every time I went to place a bag and then tell me to move it to a different area of the trunk. By the time I had loaded all of the bags, I was mentally drained. She closed her trunk and got into her car without saying a word of thanks and sped off as soon as I was out of the way.

I never saw her in the store again and I can’t say that I’m disappointed.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dc3k3t,"1, 2...wait, what’s next? I can’t count","So I work at a retail (borderline tourist) store that mainly sells clothing and shoes. One day, this older couple came in to shop around. Let’s call the man Tourist Husband (TH) and his counterpart Tourist Wife (TW). They made me dislike them almost immediately. I overhear TW talking about a brand of shirt we have and how great the price is because she usually buys them for $89 but we have them for half that. As a college student that’s working part time for $8.50/hr that makes me annoyed because who has that kind of money to throw away on mediocre shirts? Meanwhile, TH keeps asking me self-explanatory questions and and to get my attention, he keeps referring to me as “little lady” and “little miss.” I’m not sure if it’s just me, but that seems degrading. 

After an hour, they finally decide to check out and I’m so relieved because I don’t want to deal with them any longer. They end up buying a lot and the total is around $250. TH pulls out his wallet and decides to pay with 20s and 10s, which I don’t have a problem with until he hands it to me and I count it (as I’m supposed to do) and he’s $20 short. And so I tell him this. He laughs a little and makes a joke I don’t remember and hands me a 20. So, as I’m supposed to, I recount all the money with the new bill. TW says, “You don’t have to count it, you know it’s the right amount.” Before I can explain, I finish counting BUT! One of the bills got stuck behind another so I’m confused as to why it’s $20 short again. I start counting the money for a third time because I need to make sure it’s the right amount, but TW starts talking about how I can’t count, which makes it hard for me to focus on counting so it takes EVEN longer to do it. Meanwhile, a whole line is forming behind them, this is how long it’s taking. 

Finally, I confirm it’s the right amount, input how much they gave me into the computer, and open the register. When you do this, the computer will automatically tell you the change you need to give back. In this case it ended up being something around $2.67. So I look at the screen, grab the bills, then look at the screen again to check the change (I’m not great at remembering numbers so I always double check to make sure I’m right). TW scoffs at me. Literally scoffs-I didn’t think that was an actual thing real people did until now-She scoffs at me and says, “you know, girls like you used to not have a machine to help them out. They had to calculate the change themselves.” I pause for a split second before biting down on my tongue so I don’t say anything to get me in trouble. I just had them their change and wait to serve the next customer. As they walk off, TH says, “thanks little lady” and I think I almost exploded.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dbpkvw,Rude Old Man In The Express Lane,"So, as i mentioned in my last Reddit post on this subreddit, I currently work at a grocery store. Most of the time, I really see it as a positive environment. I've had my fair share of really nice and respectful customers there, but there are those kinds of customers that really regret your decision to get a job. This is one of those stories. Anyway, on with the story.

So, it was a Sunday and for those who work in retail, you know Sundays are usually the busiest days of the week. So, I was in the express lane that day and I had a really long line. I was trying to get through every customer as fast as I could because people were getting impatient that the service was slow and there were long lines. We don't have enough cashiers to be able to open more lanes. So, anyway, I was serving a customer when I noticed in the corner of my eye, I saw an old man just standing there. He was there for a good few minutes and i wanted to see what he needed. So, as soon as I finished serving this customer, i turned to him and asked, ""How can I help you?"" This guy handed me a used lottery ticket. I kinda looked and gave him the ""what do you want me to do with this?"" face. He then said,"" I want my money."" I guess he just assumed I can cash the ticket for him because, in the store that I work at, there's a register right next to the first express lane where we cash in lottery tickets. We also keep balloons and cigarettes in the same register. I in no way was able to cash in the ticket because I just don't know how to and only a manager or assistant manager is able to do so. I explain this to the old man and he gave me a dirty look like how dare this teenager working minimum wage tells me that they can't cash in this ticket and a manager has to do it. He then leaves and I continue to serve more customers. Not even two minutes later, this rude boi comes back while I was still in the process of a transaction. As soon as I finish, he completely ignored the long line of customers waiting to check out and walked up to me and demanded a pack of cigarettes. He pointed at the brand and pack he wanted (I honestly don't remember the brand, I don't smoke). Anyway, I scanned it and I told him the total (I decided not to ID him because he was obviously well over 21, the legal age to buy cigarettes, at least in my state, I don't know if every state is changing the legal age or not). This man places a bunch of change in the counter. Before I was finished counting the change, he just leaves the store with no warning. He was maybe a dollar short. I called my manager and told her about the situation. She said they'll make a report of the man and she canceled the transaction. I continued to serve customers and I was already in a bad mood because of what happened. I haven't seen that old man ever since. I don't know what happened or he got banned from the store. I just honestly hope that guy learned how to be nicer to people.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dbfmdv,I don't want your free reusable bag. What do you mean your plastic bags aren't biodegradable?,"I work in the Juice/Smoothie department in [Generic Grocery Store].

Early last year, we started charging for plastic and paper bags, and as part of a promotion we gave away free reusable bags. 1 bag per every 25$ spent. They are plastic based but I've seen customers use the same bag for years and years. They're proper reusable bags and not just slightly thicker plastic - and they hold more than a regular disposable bag too.

Customer comes through our till spends $55. I start up my spiel. 

Me - Hey! Just a heads up we are starting to charge for plastic and paper bags. We are giving away reusable bags for the next two weeks with certain purchases.  You'd be getting two free bags with this purchase.

Customer - Can I see them?

Me - Of course, [I grab the bags and hold them out to her]

C - But these are plastic.

Me - They're reusable. I've had mine for two years and its held up well.

C - Yeah but... These are plastic.

[At this point my coworker, J, comes up]

J - They're reusable, and free. 

C - I don't want them, they're plastic.

Me - Okay! Would you like me to put these in a disposable paper bag instead?

C - I don't like paper. Give me a normal bag.

Me - Like... a plastic bag? [I reach down and grab a single use bag.]

C - Of course. Are they biodegradable?

J - N..no? They're plastic. They break down into smaller plastics but don't biodegrade. You'd be better off taking the free reusable bag.

C - Oh. I was hoping they were compostable.

Me - Do you want the reusable bag then?

C - Absolutely not. Its PLASTIC.

t3_dbk4mc,I was on my hands and knees looking at the price,"I manage the front end/sometimes the entire grocery store. Monday is normally the day I make up/type in the schedule so I'm not on the floor a whole lot. I had just bought my lunch and was walking back upstairs when a cashier called me over to help. I don't mind really, most issues I can fix in a few seconds. Customer had grabbed the 30 pack of toilet paper which was $20.99 instead of the 22 pack that was on sale for $8.99. A sale that big has a lot of people buying so off the top of my head I already knew he had grabbed the wrong one.

Me = me. CM = Confused Man. SD = Service Desk Employee.

Me: ""Sorry you grabbed the wrong one, the one on sale is the 22 pack, do you want me to run and grab it for you?""

CM: ""Oh ok yeah thats fine.""

Now I'm not entirely sure what happened between when I left and came back but his mood had shifted. The cashier is the nicest, quietest middle-aged lady who I honestly don't think is capable of speaking in anything louder than a loud whisper.

Me: ""Ok here's the right one, this one is the $8.99 one.""

CM: ""No I want this one for $15.99, I know I saw the price with my own two eyes.""

The regular price of the 22 pack is $15.99 but it's got a big tag on it that says $8.99 so there's actually no toilet paper over there for $15.99.

Me: ""I was just over there and this one is for 30 rolls $20.99 and this one with 22 rolls is $8.99, I'll put the 30 pack in for $15.99 but the $8.99 one is still the better value."" (I agreed to put in anyway just to get him out)

CM: ""I was on my fucking hands and knees trying to read that tag and I know what I fucking saw""

Me: ""Ok I told you I would put it in if you wanted it, do you want the 30 pack for $15.99?""

CM: ""Yes I do.""

So I put it in and walk away. If you thought the story was over, just you wait. He has 3 gift cards, 2 of them only have a few dollars and the third one has the full $50. So he puts in the first two and still has $18 left to pay for the rest of his stuff. I had ALMOST made it to the staircase to go upstairs when I hear the cashier saying ""Sir! Sir! you havent finished paying yet!"" So because shes probably already horrified and confused by this guy I figure I might as well go tell this guy to finish paying. He had stopped at the service desk so while he's there I go up to him and say

Me: ""Sir when you're done here you have to go back to the register, you payment didn't complete.""

CM: ""What the fuck do you think I'm doing here I'm paying for my stuff right here""

Me: ""No this is the service desk you can't pay here, you have to pay for the items at the register it was rung up on.""

Now the service desk employee is very confused because she then turns to him and says

SD: ""All you told me to do was check the balance on your gift card, you have $50 on it. You can't pay here.""

CM: ""Why can't I pay here? This is a register is it not?!""

Me: ""Well yes but you didn't ring up your items here, your order is on register 4, you need to pay over there.""

CM: ""This makes no fucking sense I just want to pay for my items""

Me: ""You used two gift cards on register 4, you can use that one to pay for the rest of it.""

He then proceeded to walk past the register he was supposed to go to and then I had to remind him AGAIN that he was supposed to go to register 4.

t3_db96wj,Your pocket is moving.,"So we need this one. I used to work the service counter at a trucking company. One day, a driver comes in to drop off his truck. Dude is HUGE. Not fat, muscles. Like if the truck broke down, the load would be on time anyways. He had to turn sideways to go through the door.

I'm setting up his appointment and he's got a foot long sandwich in his hand, which he's eating as we're talking. Politely, but eating. At one point, he's got a few questions to answer so the sandwich is stationary. His shirt pocket started to move. Out pops the fluffiest Pomeranian I've ever seen. Pup's trying to get the sandwich but there just isn't enough of him to reach. Guy noticed me watching and looked down. ""Awwww. Want some, Cujo?"" and tears a chunk off. Dog takes it and retreats into the pocket.

I mean, who calls a Pom ""Cujo""?  Guy apologizes that he brought the pup in. I inform him our rule is pets can be brought in if they are under control. Clearly, he is, so he's welcome. 

Driver went to the office and came back later as we're finishing his truck. Cujo got taken out to meet me and he's sniffing around my counter.  My supervisor comes out, first seeing this giant taking up both our waiting chairs. The he sees Cujo. ""What the...?""  Arf! Arf! My supervisor said it explained the dog hair in the cupholder.

 Driver came back another time before I got downsized. Cujo plumped up to 3 pounds!

t3_dbgqxr,"No, No, I Don't Want to Move in With An Attempted Shoplifter...","So, at the store where I work, there's usually only one cash register open at a given time, and on the night in question, I was running it. From said register, you can see the three other main registers - our backup, the one in the beauty department, and the one in photo. Our beauty register has a lot of free samples in cabinets, but you wouldn't know they were there without looking in areas a customer shouldn't be. Also, right next to the register, there's a mini endcap with a bunch of travel size beauty products, mostly smaller versions of the things we sell in regular sizes. 


So it's a busy weekend night at my store, and it's just myself, a shift manager, and maybe a second shift manager. We've been a little shorthanded when it comes to weekend nights lately. I'm checking people out when my shift manager (we'll call her Melanie) pings me on our walkies.


Melanie: Hey, Me, there's a blonde woman in beauty who's prowling around the register area. She's taken one of the beauty bags and it looks like she's filling it up with samples, which is okay, but check it when you check her out, okay?

Me: Copy that. I'll look out for her.


The ""beauty bags"" are higher quality versions of our regular bags that don't fall apart with a mild breeze or if you look at it wrong. If we check people out on the beauty register, we usually use them, but they're not anywhere else in the store. No one had used the beauty register all day, so seeing one of the beauty bags in use would be a very unusual thing.


No more than fifteen minutes or so later, the blonde woman (we'll call her Sara) came up front to check out with a basket bulging with clearance beauty items and a distinctly drug-addled-adjacent (aka, I'm not sure if she was high or not, but she certainly seemed it) demeanor about her. 


As I'm scanning her items, she starts to talk about her divorce. And her three daughters, who most of these items are for. And how I'm apparently about the same age as her daughters. (That wouldn't surprise me, although I'm also probably older than she realizes.) Honestly, I'm just trying to get through the transaction, because I know that eventually, I'm going to have to ask her about the tiny little elephant in the room - the beauty bag sitting next to her basket. And I'm not ready for that conversation.


So, finally, she's ready to pay. And then I hold up the beauty bag. 


Me: Can I look in this, please? 

Sara: Oh, sure! It's just a bunch of samples, but I understand!
 

So I start going through it. Most of it is samples, for sure, but there's also a few expensive perfume testers and a couple of travel-sized items from the mini endcap. (And, not that I was going to say anything, but, uh, if she was looking for the good samples, she missed them.)


Me: Ma'am, these are testers, they're not samples or for sale and I can't give them to you. And, uh, these lotions are for sale, they're not samples.

Sara: Oh my God, okay, that's fine! I thought they were all free samples! I was going to give those to my daughters, because we don't have anything fun right now, but if you can't, that's fine! (Because spending over $100 on clearance beauty items isn't ""fun"" enough, I guess.)


Right. At this point, I'm determined to get her out the door and move on with my night, because something about this doesn't feel right. She pays, leaves, and I breathe a sigh of relief. At least the next customers in line are nice, normal, and exactly what I expect from a weekend night like that. 


Until she comes back in the store about 5-10 minutes later. And then that's when it takes a turn toward the bizarre, jumps the guardrail, and goes careening off the cliff.


Sara: So! I wanted to ask you a question.

Me: *internally* Oh God, what could she possibly want.

Sara: I told you how I was getting a divorce, right?

Me: Yeah, you might have mentioned something about it.

Sara: I was thinking...do you want to move in with me into my spare room? I can't afford my giant house all by myself.

Me: ....What?

Sara: Yeah, I have a spare room, you seem like a nice girl, move in with me, then I can afford to stay and I'm sure it's nicer than wherever you live on a (Store) paycheck.

Me: ....Yeaaaaaaaah, uh, no, sorry, I'm okay, though. Thanks.


The customer I was helping at that point kept laughing about it. And then the next time I saw said customer (let's call her Dana), she asked me about it.


Dana: So, whatever happened to that crazy lady that asked you to move in with her?

Me: *shrugs* I never saw her again after that night. That literally came out of nowhere, so I don't know why she was asking it.

Customer's teenage daughter's jaw was scraping the ground. 

Dana: Oh, I felt so bad for you that night, but you handled it so well. Better than I would have. I would have slapped her.


And the three of us laughed and they went on their way. I hope I never see Sara again, but I'll always remember her as the customer who tried to make her cashier her roommate. Sheesh. The only roommate I want right now has four legs, a tail, and is currently curled up at my feet dreaming of salmon treats.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dbnw6n,My brief stint as an improvised security detail,"This happened a couple of weeks ago, but it's my crown moment in the year and a half I've been working at this grocery store.

This is a store that also sells tobacco products at the customer service counter where the only way in or out is a door that says ""EMPLOYEES ONLY PLEASE"". For the sake of convenience, we don't always keep that door locked; not every cashier has a key, and plenty of customers will ask for smokes at the register with their other stuff. Also, it's not in a very nice neighborhood, to put it politely.

It's a slow Saturday night with myself, two other cashiers, and one woman working the customer service desk and also acting supervisor. For this story, I'm calling her Stella(S).

A drunk junkie(DJ) stumbles around the front of the store, with an open cold one in hand. Obviously grabbed from the beer aisle. He's obviously drunk and any cop would charge him for public intoxication.

S: Excuse me sir, what are you doing with that beer in your hand?

DJ stumbles his way to the service desk, and through the open door, goes for a pack of cigarettes.

S: You cannot be in here! You need to leave now! Give me that beer and get out!

It takes a more sober customer blocking the only way in to convince DJ to leave. Stella calls the police to let them know what's going on.

Stella then tells me to take my break and make sure DJ doesn't try anything until the law shows up.

I just hang out by the front doors watching him pace around. Next thing I know, he darts past me, knocking my phone out of my hand.

I chase after him shouting ""MOTHERFUCKER!"" I end up grabbing him around his waist and keeping a good hold on him. But let me tell you...dude put up one hell of a fight. I tried to put him into a particular hold(not sure what it's called, but it's where you wrap your arms around your opponent's from behind and then lace your fingers behind their neck) that was tricky to do given how much he was moving, and also the fact that he's skinnier and taller than me (I'm about 5'7 or 170cm). The main issue I had was getting him to hold still. But I digress.

DJ: You don't understand! They're coming after me! They're trying to kill me!

Me(having none of it): You done fucked up now, boy. Get the fuck out.

S(like a parent that gets annoyed when the kids are roughhousing): Irraanos, you're gonna end up getting hurt.

It ends up taking me and two other guys with a lot more heft than me to drag him out the door for a second time. Luckily, the cops were just pulling up and they put the cuffs on him in a heartbeat.


Addendum: I'm not a martial artist by any stretch of the imagination. No formal training, I just have an older brother who used to wrestle with me all the time. I'm also not a thrill seeker. But I do need to confess one thing. The adrenaline rush that I got from this whole thing was A W E S O M E. News of what I did spread pretty quickly, with most reactions being either shock or applause. I also found out from a co-worker at my other job(different store chain entirely) that one of the guys that helped me drag DJ out was her brother. I owe that guy some drinks.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dbirsr,We love long lines!,"I work in inventory in a very large chain grocery store.

Today, front end must have had a lot of sick calls or there was an unanticipated rush, because there were some rather long line ups. I was walking back to the office when a woman in line stops me. I recognize her as a serial complainer.

**Woman:** Excuse me, you need to open more cashes. There are very long lines.

**Me:** I can't open more cashes, I'm not in charge there. I could mention it to the front end supervisor.

**Woman:** Yes, you should.

**Me:** I will, but I'm sure if we had any free cashiers they would be in their lanes by now.

The woman just gives me a look, like 'but I noticed and mentioned something therefore it should be changed.'

I resist the urge to roll my eyes and turn around to head to customer service, where I see the supervisor.

**Me:** Hey, \[Supervisor\], a customer thinks you should open more cash lanes.

The supervisor rolls her eyes and makes some fed-up guttural throat noise. I've betrayed her by being a colleague and coming to her with such a stupid request.

**Supervisor:** Yeah, I'd LOVE to if I COULD.

**Me:** Hey, I know, but I had to come over to talk to you because *the customer is watching me*.

At this, the supervisor looks at me, then smiles and laughs. I've not betrayed her after all, I'm just keeping up appearances with difficult customers. She rushes off and I turn to head back to the office, and sure enough I see the customer has edged away from her cart to stand in a spot where she can watch me, making sure I didn't ignore her. I quickly look away and take a different route to the office because I'd a feeling she'd have more demands of me if I were to get too close.

Oh, I should mention, she was waiting in the self-scan lineup. We have a finite number of those, they're all always on unless they're broken, and one employee works all of them. So she was complaining for... Not even her own benefit?  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",TalesFromRetail
t3_dblnz2,Our Store’s Infestation,"I’ve posted here before but to reiterate I work for a decently sized chain of farm stores. Since we are a farm store, we sell feed for basically any animal other than fish. 

For background, about a year ago we received a truck of feed from my DC that was infested with mice. We didn’t know until the pallets were in the store and they started scattering into different corners of the store. 

Fast forward to present, we’ve had multiple exterminators come almost weekly, but none have been able to make much of a difference and the mice have learned where to hide and repopulate. 

So, about a week ago when I was closing with two other people, it was about 30 minutes to close and I was working on returns (i.e. reshelving ones that weren’t damaged and writing out broken or defective merchandise). One of the things I need to reshelve were a pair of muck boots (basically an expensive, $140, pair of rubber swamp boots). I went over to the shelf and noticed another box had a bit of cardboard chewed off of it around the hole commonly found on shoe boxes to grab them easier. I sighed, realizing that a mouse probably got in it and chewed part of the box to make nesting. What I wasn’t prepared for was to pull the box down, open it and find piles of cardboard and tissue paper chewed into small shreds for nesting. I was so immune to it at that point that I just thought that a mouse had gotten busy, but wasn’t expecting that she was using it as a home. 

Grossed out, I pulled out the first boot only for momma mouse, her family and living space to follow suit. I poured them into the box, thank heavens. But then momma mouse decides to jump straight at me in an attempt to get away from me! I scream and back up watching momma run away, leaving behind her home for me to take care of. I pick up the box and immediately notice 2 naked, wriggling, pink baby mice scooting themselves around the box. 

The cashier I was working with at this point asked me what was up and I took the box over to her. We were both shocked and double checked the floor of the store to make sure no one was going to see the orphans. I searched for a pair of gloves to use so I could grab the babies keep them under control. Putting them on, I moved the nesting around and the babies started multiplying. Two turned into four, then five, then ended at eight total babies. Neither of us knew what to do with them, so we ended up just calling our manager over so he could look at the scene too. 

In the end, I had to just throw them into the dumpster we had put back. I’ve seen momma in the same area a few times after all that happened. She had chewn through the boots she had her babies in and that pair was around $160. So, I don’t necessarily feel bad for her, but I still wonder if she’s alive somewhere in the store.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dbe9om,"""You didn't remove the sensor tag!""","I'm currently working part time in a small clothing brand in my country. Also, theft and crime rates are pretty low and not something common here either. 

This clothes store has every single clothing on display tagged with a sensor tag and walking pass the sensor gates triggers it pretty easily because of how sensitive it is. A few days ago, someone stole a shirt worth $19.90 (cheapest item in the store) and our CCTV caught a child taking the shirt and running right out of the store. It so happened that it was a crowded day since it's a weekend and the staff on duty assumed that someone walked pass the sensor gates, accidentally triggering it. We only realised it at the end of the day when we were tidying up and realised a shirt was missing. The company didn't do much about it because it was cheap and simply sent out a warning to all staffs to be more careful.

Little did we know they would come back to the SAME store (we have 5 stores across the city, not far from each other).

Today, while I was serving some customers, a family of 5 walked in and triggered the sensor gates. This also happens sometimes with things bought from other stores. I brushed it off, didn't think much about it and went ahead to greet them.

They were in the store for awhile, trying on several clothing and ended up buying a TOTAL of $260++ worth of clothing. As they were about to pay, the father suddenly passes us the SAME shirt that was stolen and says, ""Oh, we bought this a while ago and you didn't remove the sensor tag, remove it! ""

I looked at the shirt, looked at my manager, looked at the customer and had this dumbfounded look on my face (we don't often sell display sets due to high quantities in our storeroom). My manager looks at them, snickers and sarcastically says, ""This looks just like the shirt that got stolen a while back, I'll remove it for you!"" 

Then somehow, I think it hit them that we have CCTVs and stock takes... 

Long story short, they ended up apologising PROFUSELY and offered to pay for it along with their other $260 worth of clothes.

For those who don't know, most glass screen protectors for iPhones come with a plastic guide you can use to make sure the glass is lined up right. It's not useful for any other purpose, so we typically throw it away with the rest of the trash.

Today a customer came in and asked if my supervisor was in. He was not, so I offered to assist. This is _approximately_ how the conversation went.

Me: ""What can I do for you.""

Customer: ""`$supervisor` forgot to put the plastic thing and the cleaning cloth back in my box. Can you find that for me?""

Me: ""We typically throw those out once we're done with them...""

As dumb as this is, she's not ^(_technically_) wrong. So we had to find the last of that exact screen protector and remove it from stock. So she could have her useless piece of plastic (and the little cloth).

t3_dbifkn,You don’t sell viagra?!,"I’m enjoying my day off, and was telling my husband about a short but very weird interaction from my last closing shift. 

Our store is a popular chain in the US, we also have a pharmacy in the back that is open limited hours each day. 

Anyway, right before closing a man walked in and headed straight to the back of the store. I assumed he was going to the pharmacy so I let him know it had closed at 6, but he shook his head and just kept walking. 

I was about to go upstairs to the office when my cashier walked up to me with a puzzled look on her face. 
She told me to look down the main aisle. When I walked around to the aisle she was pointing at, the man who had walked in minutes before was motioning for me to get over there. 
It was....weird, if that makes sense? This guy just seemed off and I couldn’t pinpoint what his deal was quite yet. 
I walked back to where he was and he finally speaks! But all he says is “come here” even though I was in a normal speaking distance away from him. Then I started to get uncomfortable. I asked him what he was looking for and he whispered “viagra” and stepped closer. 
Viagra?!
I had to be the bearer of bad news (although this whole thing just felt like he had to be joking) and let him know he needed to see his dr and get a prescription for that medication. It is definitely NOT an OTC we sell, or anyone sells OTC in the US. 

He just got a confused look on his face and stepped even closer (god I can’t stand it when people don’t have a sense of personal space, especially in THIS interaction) and just said “but he told me I could buy it here!”

I just repeated what I had already told him, and asked if there was anything else he was shopping for. 
His response was to squeeze my shoulder as he walked past muttering “but he told me I could buy it here” over and over. 

I guess it’s difficult to convey in words. But again, the whole interaction just felt so off. 
He had to be no older than 22, MAYBE 25 at the oldest. 

If you read my last post from the same day, you’ll agree that day was just weird all around. 
Usually the most uncomfortable interaction I have, which isn’t really that awkward on the scale of things, is helping a frantic single dad pick out what kind of pads his teenage daughter needs.

t3_dbf3ij,"No, lady, I can't change the price for you","I work as a cashier at a small grocery store. I've been there for about three months and oh man, do I have a lot of customer stories. For all of the cashiers out there, you're going to relate to this story in a way.

There was one time where there was a lady that came into my lane and was buying a couple of groceries. So anyway, I was charging for the items she had and one of the items was a pineapple. So, you know how some produce is charged by weight and not quantity? Well, this woman thought each pineapple was $1 per one. So, I typed the PLU code for pineapple in the register and it charged for $3, considering each pound was $1. For those who don't know or have never worked in a grocery store, in order to charge a produce item, we have to type a four-digit code (PLU code) for the item the customer wants to buy.  When she saw the price on the screen, she said, ""I thought the pineapple was a dollar."" I responded, ""The pineapple goes by the pound. It's a dollar per pound. This pineapple weights three pounds, therefore it's three dollars."" This lady just stood there as if she didn't understand what I just said for like a minute. I repeated what I said twice to get her to understand. She then said, ""Well, can't you just change the price to a dollar just this once for me?"" I told her no and she flipped out. Then, she asked to see the manager. All I just told her that the manager will tell you the same thing, but she insisted. So, I call for the manager and continued to scan the rest of her items while we waited. After a few minutes, she got even more upset and said, ""Nevermind, I don't want it. I'm not paying $3 for a pineapple."" Thanks, lady for wasting my time and holding the up the line. I hope I never see you here again.

This was my first post in this subreddit, I hope you liked this short story. I plan on posting more stories here about rude customers. What are some of your worst customers stories? Let me know.

t3_db4quc,Screen Protector Did Its Job!,"I work at a cell phone retail store. Someone came in and complained that they purchased a tempered glass screen protector (the kind with a lifetime manufacturer guarantee) and it CRACKED when she dropped it, so she wanted her money back. 

After multiple times of trying to explain to the customer that this is the PURPOSE of glass screen protectors (seeing as her actually SCREEN wasn’t broken), I tried a different tactic and suggest she do a warranty claim with the manufacturer,  but I get cut off multiple times and she says she will just “sit there until [she] gets [her] money back,” to which I’m like “that’s fine but we close in an hour, so I’d have to kick you out then.” 

After multiple times back and forth, I finally got out that I can’t return a broken screen protector, but if she gets it replaced by the manufacturer then I can take THAT one back, and she was like “why didn’t you tell me that to begin with?”

C: NO! I ALREADY PAID, YOU CANT MAKE ME PAY AGAIN.

Literally by this point my customary retail smile was gone from being yelled at by this lady, but thankfully a customer behind the woman just started laughing hysterically.

NC (New customer): Girl, shes just trying to give you back your water bottle, don't you have eyes?

Cue angry yelling customer turning red and meekly taking the water bottle while saying sorry a lot under her breath to me.

t3_db30si,Invisible Green Beans,"On phone, have a cat sitting on my face, english is my language ect


I was helping my manager run produce yesterday, we're packed cause another store of our chain has closed for renovations, it's Sunday and our produce order is WAY too big. (it filled half the warehouse).

So I'm rushing like a chicken with no head, clearly very busy and a man comes up to me and asks if we 'have any green beans left'.

'I dont have any on my current pallet but I'll have a  run out back and check for you' I smile, he just sorta nods while fiddling with his phone.

I tell him to Wait There, he agrees and I rush out back, searching our GIANT prod order for beans.
 I even checked the chiller storage but with no luck.
I admit defeat and hurry back, it's taken me a few minutes to do this and I don't want to make him wait even longer for bad news.


I rush allll the way back to produce (at the stores entrance) and the man who asked is just fucking gone.

Poof, pow, bam no more man 


I'm more than a little peeved, i run my ass off for this guy and he just wanders off like an inattentive child.
I huffily mention it to my manager, he laughs and points at the shelf, we had oooodles of green beans the entire time.

'yeah I saw him aye, he waited for like 30 seconds before he walked out' my managee informed me, in kiwi.



I'll admit some blame, after 10 years in customer service, I should have known better than to trust a customers idea of looking for something.

A woman came in, looking for shoes for her son. She told me she was a nurse, for some reason, maybe she thought I'd respect her more. She picked some out, and I went to the back. I forgot that the shoes come in two different colours and that I can't see the different because of the type of colour blind I am. I grabbed the shoes and brought them out. Apparently they were black and not navy blue or the other way around.

The woman opened the box and said: ""Are you stupid!? These are not the same colour as the display! How can you not know your colours!?""

I looked right at her and said: ""I'm sorry ma'am, I'm colour blind. Let me get someone who isn't to help you.""

t3_dalmwa,Spoiled old people can't read,"I don't post on reddit much but this lady pissed me off and I need to vent.

So I work at a grocery store that's notorious for poorly worded sale signs. It's pretty common that I have to over explain sale specifications to customers and typically apologize for how complex simple stuff is.

Specifically, I work in the bakery, and we had a sale for some of our breads; buy two and get them for $3.50 each. 

I get a call from a register up front telling me that a woman has a couple of our instore breads, and she says they're on sale but they're ringing up regular price. I tell her they are and sale and ask if she has two different kinds, which she says yes. I grab one of the kinds she has (the multigrain one, the other was buttercrust) and run up the the front of the store with the bread. We scan two of the multigrain and it shows up on sale. As a result we assume that the sale is only for two of the same kind.

The woman gets upset and says she didn't think running in for some bread would be so damn difficult. I agree and apologize, and the two of us call over our supervisor who rings her in for the deal on her two different breads, giving her the sale regardless.

I go back to my department and check the sign again. The woman comes up behind me and points to the sign, emphasizing that she's right and I'm wrong. I dunno why she came back since she got her way, but again I apologize, telling her that sometimes the signs are worded badly. She tells me I should fix that, but since it's a chain store we get the designs from head office outside the store, so I tell her I can't change it.

""Yeah, it seems problem solving skills are hard to come by at this store.""

She walks off, and I'm pissed. I now read the sign again, PROPERLY now that I don't have a Karen breathing down my neck, and read that the sale is only for our grain bread, so the buttercrust wasn't part of the deal.

I figured I'd chase after her and let her know, just in case she came back. I honestly did want to be nice about it and save her the trouble next time she came in. I call after her as she makes her way to the exit.

The bitch fucking ignores me. So, being the kind person I am, I just yell out (at the front where all the customers are paying) ""Ma'am the sale didn't work because the buttercrust wasn't listed, have a good night!""

She just walks out faster, I hope out of embarrassment.

t3_daq53a,I hate customer service,"I work at a hunting, fishing, camping, outdoors store, and sometimes, when I pull the short straw, I have to work at the customer service desk. I am not very well trained there, and often have to call for a supervisor, manager, or another employee to help me out. Today I had a customer who wanted to return some fishing reels that were broken. (Which, ugh in of itself. The quality of our merchandise has gone down SO far since we merged with another store. Causes lots of problems for customer service)

His reels, however exceeded our return policy. We have a generous 90 day return policy. Doesn't matter if you broke it in front of us. We take it back. But it has to be within 90 days. His was from nearly a year ago. 

I tell him I can't return it. He says he just wants to exchange it for a working one. It was the first time he used it. He bought it in November. You cant fish in the winter. I'm like, sounds fair. I don't know how to help you, though. So I call up a manager. Who tells him the same exact thing. But, he understands the struggle too, and is willing to take 50% off whatever he purchases to replace it. The guy blows up. Tells us we have horrible customer service. Any other place would have taken it back and exchanged it for him. Why are we being so horrible. He is gonna call corporate and complain about how awful we are. 

I just don't get it, guys. We can't just give you a $100 reel because you want it. Why do they think yelling at us is going to change our mind? I love working with this company, but man. I hate when they put me at the customer service desk.",TalesFromRetail
t3_dar303,I get the watch for less than I thought? Well the I won't take it!,"I'm on mobile, dyslexic and not a native English speaker etc etc, you know the drill

So I work in a jewelry and watch store and on Friday a colleague from another store called me and told me this story:

A guy tells my collegue that he wants a couple of pieces of some jewelry and a watch and my collegue gets them for him. Atm if you buy 50€ worth of items, you get a 25€ discount coupon for your next purchase (till the end of October). In order to pay with the coupon and get a new coupon your total at the register has to be over 75€. So all of the items this guy was buying were over 75€, so he wanted to first pay one, get the coupon, then pay the other with the coupon and get a new one and then pay for the third one with the second coupon and get a third coupon. After talking with the manager my colleague started doing this, but as she peeped the watch to our computer, she realized that it was on sale. The price was lower than it would've been with the coupon, so she happily told it to the customer thinking that he'd be really happy to hear that. Nope. He ended up not buying anything, cause he would've had to pay less for all of it? Like why? Cause he didn't get that one coupon that he would've anyways used immediately? Sometimes you just can't understand customers...

So I'm ringing up this couple's flatbed of stuff, moving it from the belt back to the flatbed, and it's A LOT of stuff. While I'm doing this, I'm telling them about our rewards card to sell them. I did not stop what I was doing, I was literally booping things and moving them while talking. It took about 10 minutes due to the sheer volume of stuff they had. I did manage to sell the rewards, they're happy, I'm happy I got a sale. Then the next customer comes up. She has about three things. So I start, she smiles, then she starts. 

Lady: You are so slow.  (She's still smiling)

Me: Sorry about that. (Smiles back) 

Lady: If you had gone any slower you would've gone backwards. (All smiles!)

Me: (Laugh a little, cause what else can you do, kind of hoping she's not serious.)

Lady: No, really. 

Me: (Stares. Finished her three items. Give her price.  Stares some more. )

This staring thing actually goes on for about a minute, no lie. Usually I would say something with their total, but I'm a little annoyed. She finally puts her card into the machine, paying finishes.

Since it's getting to be the rainy season in my city lots of people are coming in to buy brand new wiper blades for their car. Today a lady came in looking for wipers for a 2015 subaru forester, I think. The phone was ringing at the same time and no one else could pick it up. So I quickly told the lady ""it looks like your car takes a 21 and a 22 and we have those aisle three on the right."" When she went over to the aisle I picked up the phone to help the other customer calling in. While I was on the phone she came back up to me and asked ""do I need two 21s or two 22s?"" 🤦‍♂️ Since I was now on the phone helping someone else my coworker, who just finished with their customer, had to come over and look up the vehicle again for this lady and walk over to grab for her which ones she needed. Wiper blades are not hard. They are measured and displayed in inches. I tell you a measurement, you go pick a pair, you pay for them, you leave. That simple. The other issue I see is when I'm standing there helping a customer pick wiper blades. They will grab one and start to walk to the counter. I will grab the other side of the matching brand and when I get to the counter they look at me confused and ask ""oh did I grab the wrong one?""
""No, you need one of these and you need one of those.""
""You mean they don't come in pairs?"" 🤦‍♂️ I can count on one hand how many cars all use the same size wiper blade on both sides for which it would be logical for them to be sold in pairs.

t3_daf6tg,That's no Trolley‽,"Being my first post here I'll give you some background. I work as a duty manager in an Aussie bottle shop.

This happened earlier today during my shift. I had just finished helping clear out the queues of people at the registers, I had plans of finishing off running today's stock onto the shop floor, but this man had other plans in mind.

Without actually saying anything an older bloke gave me the tiniest of head nods to try and get my attention, which anyone except for the sharpest of eyes would have seen, lucky I have good eyes I guess? Anyways he asked for me to show him where ""overpriced famous wine"" was. Being a top shelf bottle I never looked down, and as I tried to walk around him to check the shelf I nearly knocked into the strangest thing I've seen working at this store for the past two years.

Rather than a shopping trolley or a basket, he was using [one of these](https://i.imgur.com/BSb7bGU.jpg). Not sure what else to call it other than a basket holder. This is where my customer service persona was nearly outed. When I laugh, I laugh a lot, and almost broke out of character. Luckily there was no stock on the shelf, so I ran out back with tears in my eyes.

I shouted to a co-worker out the back to save me and grab the bottle and give it to him whilst I spent the next 5 minutes trying to recover. When my co-worker came back she told me this wasn't the first time he had done this, last time another team member had stopped him trying to walk out to the car park with it. And later on I asked my co-workers on the register whether they saw it, and the one who served him said

""I told him it wasn't a trolley and he responded 'I know'"".

So today I guess I've met the most alpha shopper, and maybe the most ignorant man in Sydney, hopefully you enjoyed this! If you guys did I'll write some more antics I've been through, however I've been lucky for almost all of my customers to be very happy, except for the odd occasion. So lucky me I guess.",TalesFromRetail
t3_da2xcg,To the burglar who fed our office cat: thanks.,"I manage a small furniture store in a formerly upscale area. The owner has been getting on to me for the last few weeks about randomly leaving a light on at night when I leave. 

He and I are the only people who have keys to the building as far as either of us know. Our landlord doesn't have a key.

I honestly don't think I have been doing it. I am very careful about turning everything off, especially once I've already been confronted by my boss about it. The last time this happened was Tuesday. I had the day off and one of my employees called saying the owner was complaining about the lights again. 

With him now complaining to other people, I have been extra careful about turning *everything* off at night. Double and triple checking before I leave with flashlight in hand. I'm not the one leaving lights on.

I needed to be in early this morning to meet a truck driver and I beat the owner in. As soon as I unlocked the door I noticed that the lights were on. 

Nothing has been stolen. The store cash is still exactly the same as it was last night when I left, the cokes in the refrigerator are still there. My custom shop Kramer guitar is still hanging on the wall where I leave it. (My job is really boring.)

The *ONLY* thing that was different other than my office light being left on was a half eaten pile of cat food left in front of our building where we don't normally feed the office cats. 

I have called every employee, our landlord, the maintenance man, and the owner's wife to make sure none of them borrowed a key and came in while we were closed. They all deny knowing anything about it. I trust them, but *somebody* is doing it.

Neither my boss or I really care. Whoever it is that's coming in at night to sleep on our mattresses isn't actually stealing anything other than my enjoyment of feeding the cats in the mornings. We just want them to turn out the lights when they leave.

t3_da2tsr,My Biggest Pet Peeve,"So I'm back with another story from cell phone land. This one is a bit shorter than normal but I felt like I needed to post it to help calm down. 


The first thing this lady does when she walks into the store is simply say ""read the notes on my account"" in as bitchy of a tone as you can have. That's not going to help you any lady. I ask for her ID. Of course she left it in her car.


Once she came back with her ID I opened her account to look at the notes. All they said was that she wanted to return some phones. Cool, you could have just said that. I asked her to explain the situation as there was obviously something else going on. She once again says just read the notes. I tell her they all it says is that she wants to return some phones.


Before I ever start a return I explain that there's a restocking fee per phone. I was going to also let her know that customer service had already credited her account for the restocking fees, which happens all the time. Before I can say that she puts her hand in my face and tells me ""you can be quiet now"".

Hands in my face just sets me off. I tried to hold it together but not before telling her she can not do that and just leave if she's going to ask that way. I turned around and walked off to let my manager know I was going to that back before I did something to lose my job.

t3_da39tu,Customer disappointed at gravity,"Hi first time poster on this sub.

Nothing too dramatic here, just a light-hearted funny story. I work in a large retail store and one day a customer (doesn't speak a lot of english) came looking to buy a kick scooter for her kid. I show her the children scooters and she spends some time checking them out. She starts off with the scooters with 3 wheels and decided that they weren't suitable for her kid's age, so she moves on to the bigger two-wheeled scooters. After a few minutes,

C: Hmmm, I don't like any of these they're not very stable

Me: What do you mean by stable? I can assure you our scooters are well designed

C: No, no, look at this 

She brings one of the scooters over and has one hand holding the handle. She then releases her grip and the scooter leans over and falls.

C: See! \*repeats this a few times\* It keeps falling down

At this point I'm kinda speechless and scratching my head, I mean ???? Does gravity not exist where she's from??

Me: Uhhhhh.... I mean, it has two wheels so it's gonna fall if you don't hold on to it (a little dumbfounded that I had to explain the laws of gravity to an adult)

C: No, no this won't do, thanks for your help

And then she left. I spent the entire day sharing the story with my colleagues, trying to figure out what exactly she was looking for and deduced that it may have been a scooter with an in-built side stand. Since she didn't speak much english, she probably had trouble communicating this. But either way, it made for a funny story and a good laugh, I still vividly remember watching her sigh as she dropped the scooter on the floor multiple times as if disappointed that gravity is a thing",TalesFromRetail
t3_da4hzc,Nightmare customer with too much money nickel and dimes me into a coma &lt;/3,"Preface: I'm sorry, but I've had two awful days at work in a row and just have to vent to keep from going insane. This may get ramble-y and I apologize for the length ahead of time. For background, I work at a specialty store in a pretty wealthy neighborhood of a major metro city in the US. Yesterday a woman yelled at me because I didn't know the exact polyphenal content of every olive oil in our store (she was looking for a number, which **does** exist, but even the professional tasters usually only say ""high"" or ""low""). Then this morning I had to lift a 160 lb. pallet up a flight of stairs by myself because the owners forgot a shipment was coming today. ANYWAY, that brings us to our first customer of the day:

A lady comes in from the rain and it's clear she's had some plastic surgery done. I know it's extremely problematic, but I really judge people for plastic surgery. I know, I know, but I'm currently uninsured (fuck the U.S.) and can barely afford to survive while she gets monthly botox. Whatever.

She asks for something by the wrong name and I - not correcting her, just confirming - use the right name. She goes over to inspect it and says ""um ya, that I guess."" As she walks away, she mumbles something I can't catch. This is how the exchange went, ""L"" for lady, ""M"" for me:

M: ""I'm sorry?""

L: ""What?""

M: ""Sorry, I just didn't hear what you said.""

L: ""The neighborhood discount.""

M: ""Oh! Yeah, I know the bakery offers one.""

L: ""No, I mean I would like the neighborhood discount here.""

M: ""Oh, I'm sorry, we don't offer a neighborhood discount here.""

This whole time she's been looking at her phone. She sets the phone down and looks directly at me.

L: ""Every store in this neighborhood offers a neighborhood discount.""

M: ""Okay, well, the only stores I know that offer the neighborhood discount are the cigar shop and the bakery, and that's only for-""

L: ""The what?""

M: ""The bakery?""

L: ""Which bakery?""

M: ""Uhh, \[inserts bakery name\] French bakery? It's two doors down from here"" (this is a very well known bakery that has a line out the door every Friday and Saturday morning. I go there once a week and routinely have conversations with customers and locals about it - if she doesn't know about it, it's highly unlikely that she lives or works in the neighborhood).

L: ""I don't know that one, but I do know the cigar shop and every other local business on this block offers a neighborhood discount.""

M: ""Well, I'm really sorry, but no one here has informed me that we offer a neighborhood discount.""

L: ""This is unbelievable. Totally unbelievable. You local businesses beg all of us to support you and promise discounts for locals, but when we do you don't honor them. I can't believe this.""

M: ""Ok, well, I'm really sorry. I could probably give you 5% off today?""

L: ""THAT'S THE NEIGHBORHOOD DISCOUNT!""

M: ""Right, that's the neighborhood discount at the bakery and the cigar shop. I don't know what other stores may offer.""

L: ""Unbelievable. Fine, yes, 5%.""

M: ""Ok, great."" I start to ring her up. I try to defuse the situation by just making some casual conversation. ""So what business do you own or work at?""

L: ""No, I live here.""

M: ""Oh, ok. Well, I know the bakery's discount is really only for other local business owners or employees. I don't think they offer it to people that just live in the neighborhood.""

L: ""This is totally ridiculous. I told you already I don't know what bakery you're talking about. I can leave my name and you can look it up later, I live here and I get the neighborhood discount.""

M: ""That's not necessary, I believe you \[I don't\], it's just the owners are extremely strict on giving out discounts they haven't told us about beforehand. I'm sorry for being difficult, but it's my job on the line here.""

L: ""You should know that locals get the neighborhood discount. It's totally unbelievable that you wouldn't honor it.""

She pays and starts to head out the door. I say, ""have a great day, try to stay dry out there."" She says, ""yep.""

First and foremost, I don't believe she lives here at all. I think she lives in a notoriously wealthy suburb nearby and probably heard about the neighborhood discount from the cigar shop owner and assumed every business offered it. Second, I basically gave her the discount to shut her up, but it only saved her 30 cents. I doubt the owners will even spot it, but we did just get grilled about giving out too many discounts a few weeks ago.

I found some dry coffee grounds when the guy walks in (he'll be referred to as BM for bitter man). I see him as he walks in and inform him as I always do when I'm semi-busy: ""Hi, I'll be right with you, give me just a moment.""

I go to find my coworker quickly to ask her if she knew which coffee grounds they were, can't find her right away, rush back, put the coffee stuff back on the pot (took about 30-45 seconds tops, our store is small).

Dude, it 10:30 in the morning, what ""shit"" do you possibly have to do? The morning rush has passed. Now, I could've refused service to BM, but I didn't want to deal with the hassle. BM  slams a $20 on the counter and tells me to put $5 on pump ""blah"". You're in such a rush for *FIVE DOLLARS.* BM is still insulting me while I process his ""transaction"". I put the change on the counter, furthest from him as possible. Normally, I always tell people to have a great day, even those who are rude, but in the passive aggressive tone most retail workers know. BM didn't even deserve that, because he's still spewing insults (mainly calling me fucking stupid) and as BM is walking out he said I was wasting his time, so I just tell him *BYE*. 

Part of me wanted to ""accidentally"" hit stop on his pump, another regretted that I didn't get the number off his company truck to call and make a complaint. All in all, I'm over people who think they can treat retail/customer service people like garbage. In the time he spent complaining about me and insulting me, he could've been outside, pumped his gas, and gone, but no. BM had to insult me for 2 minutes straight. Thankfully PC was super nice to me afterwards. Working retail for nearly 4 years straight in the worst possible places, it's hard to get under my skin anymore.",TalesFromRetail

My personal favourite is a little old lady who called up. “I booked a $20,000 trip, how do I claim my points?”

After asking a multitude of questions it became apparent she hadn’t booked with us. I informed her that unfortunately we couldn’t give her any points, because it wasn’t our booking.

t3_d9wq4e,I want a refund for the rewards points I didn't use,"Fuel clerk 

Already posted today, but here's another one from later on. 

Woman approaches me and gives me her rewards card to scan. Nothing odd, a lot of customers start off with that so they can see how many points they have to determine how much gas they want. 

Well, not this lady. 

I scan her card and she announces that she'd like to use her fuel points on pump 8. Still not odd at first, but she's just standing there waiting for what I assumed was for me to ask how much she wants the pump set for. I ask how much she'd like me to set it for and she tells me that she's already pumped. 

I inform her that the rewards card works by deducting money off your gas per gallon as you pump, thus it must be scanned at pump before you begin. The pump even asks you right off the bat if you'd like to use your rewards card, you have to hit yes or no to start the payment process which means this woman hit ""no"", proceeded to pay for her gas and then came to me to use her rewards. 

She could be a newer customer or maybe her husband does the gas buying, so I give her the benefit of the doubt and offer to call customer service (we're part of a grocery store) to see if they would manually remove her points and give her a cash refund for them. She responds to this by slapping the counter and demanding that I just give her the cash refund there, since I'm the one who messed it up. 

Still trying to be as customer servicey as possible, I asked what she meant and she informs me that I didn't ask her for her rewards card before she bought her gas, so I'm the one at fault. Once again, I explain that if you pay at the pump you have to follow the prompt on the screen and scan your rewards card before you put your credit card in to use it. Her response was to again demand that I compensate her with cash. 

Not entirely sure what to do about this anymore, I try to end it by explaining that I do not have access to her *store name* account so I have absolutely no way to change anything on it, including modifying her rewards points. But a manager in the grocery store does, and would be able to deduct the points and give her cash for them. 

She again drills me to just open my drawer and give her cash, I guess assuming that I have a magical button that I can push that tells me how much cash I owe her and stops my drawer from being that much short. 

She ended up cussing me out, leaving empty handed and not bothering to talk to customer service.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d9i38q,"Lady, you think you're smart. Which is not the same as actually being smart....","I sell glasses in a big box store. 

I had a 60 something lady come in that basically had the condescending ""I've never worked a day in my life so I'm above you"" attitude about her. You know the type. 

The arm had snapped off of her glasses, and she wanted to know if I could put her lenses in a new frame. This isn't an uncommon request in itself. They didnt come from our shop originally, so I explain that the lens has to be a very close match to the new frame and it can be hard to find that because suppliers like to use different patterns so you have to go back to the original shop. I'm still happy to see if I can find her one though. 

I go over and start seeing if theres one I can make work. This is like hunting a needle in a haystack, and there are usually only one or two frames at most that will work. Basically you have to take what you can get, and its rarely the ideal color or style.

Her original frame is a narrow rectangle. The lens size is 52 mm wide, and maybe 32 mm tall at most. Most optical frames have the width stamped on the inside, so she sees a 52 on the inside of hers. 

She pulls down this massive cat eye frame. Its in the 45mm tall range. Her lens is a skinny rectangle. This is a tall trapazoid. 

""This says 52 on the inside. Mine say 52 on the inside. They're the same size. I want these.""

I'm dumbfounded, but try to be as polite as I can. I reply ""Ma'am, I'm sorry, but 52 is the width of the lens. While these two have the same width, they dont have the same height. Your lens is way too small for this frame. We'll have to go with a shorter one thats closer to a rectangle."" 

This was not acceptable.

She reiterates ""This says 52. Mine is 52. They ARE the same size. 52 and 52 are the SAME NUMBER."" 

""Ma'am, I understand that. But 52 is the width. These lenses are not even close to the same shape."" I even hold her lens up to the taller one to show her. ""I have no way to stretch your lens. Thats not something that can be done. We have to find one closer to the same height and shape."" 

""But they both say 52. What don't you understand about that?! 52 and 52 are the SAME! Its the same size! Why can't you seem to understand that!"" She says this like I'm a moron who probably can't even count to 52.

This lady seemed to think she'd found some archaic knowledge by matching these two numbers, like it was a shoe size. If it matches, it works. 

After about ten minutes of back and forth with two coworkers backing me up, she just refused to believe me and left in a huff. I like to imagine she struggled with fitting the square block through the circular hole as a child.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d9p3ji,Box or Bag?,"I worked for a high-end Chocolate Boutique. We sold chocolate either by piece in a box at a set price or by weight in bulk bags. A woman came in and said she wanted X amount of dollars worth of chocolate. I tried to explain to her the bag vs. Box system and how she would actually be getting a better deal if she got a box with a certain number. She fixed me with this angry glare and acted like I was slow, saying ""0r you could do what I asked.""

Taken aback but still wanting to do a good job I went ahead and did a she instructed weighing out the amount that she wanted and putting them into a bulk bag as is our procedure.

t3_d9o1zx,I can't give you what I haven't got.,"Just remembered another story from my old job. No armour plate vest involved this time though! :) 

My homewares shop sold fabric, always by the metre or half metre. When we came to the end of the fabric roll and had something left over or had a piece with a fault in it, we sold these pieces as seconds at a heavily discounted price. They were immensely popular with people doing crafts or small DIY projects. These were usually kept in a big wire basket in the fabric section. 

Another thing to mention is that each fabric had their own name. If you were buying fabric, you told a staff member 'I'd like X metres of ABC fabric please'. Then it would be cut for you. But we couldn't put through a piece as seconds until the stock system had been reset to 0, which had to be done by a manager who checked the actual amount of fabric remaining and authorised it. 

This day I wasn't even meant to be on fabrics but someone was off sick and I was a spare pair of hands. I was sorting out fabric rolls when a lady came up to me. 

&gt;L: hi, I've been looking through your basket. Have you got a 'Lucy' fabric [I can't remember its actual name] in there? 

&gt;Me: unfortunately the seconds are just what's there. We don't have them anywhere else.

&gt;L: are you sure? Haven't you got any more out back? 

&gt;Me: no, sorry. They get bagged, priced and then put straight in there. 

&gt;L: really? Are you sure you haven't got a piece somewhere? 

Cue 5min of this same conversation. This lady just couldn't work out that if it wasn't there then it wasn't there. I tried every way to explain. Then she asks: 

&gt;Well can't you just cut a piece for me off then sell it as seconds? 

&gt;Me: No, sorry. That would be a fraud offence and I could lose my job for that. 

Until this point shed been annoying but polite, but this answer set her off. She started shouting about how 'ridiculous' it was that we didn't have it. Meanwhile I was stood there wondering why she was finding this so hard to understand. 

Luckily for me the supervisor for that section came down for the start of her shift, saw what was happening and took over. From what the supervisor said she still didn't get the fabric she wanted.",TalesFromRetail

I work at a gas station where we lock the doors after 10 at night and do transactions through a window with an intercom type system. A woman asked for a lighter, and when I go the lighter and rang it up, it was $1.81. I told her the price, and asked how she wanted to pay, but instead of paying, she put a house key in the little pass-through drawer we used for transactions.

I asked her again how she would be paying,and she went back to her car after taking the key back. She didn't put any money in, and this went back and forth for about 3-5 minutes.

t3_d95vmz,"The ""Broken"" Lawn Mower","Welcome back to Tales From Returns! Where I worked, we had options that they wanted us to use instead of normal returns. Such as Repair options. Example being, if someone bought a staple gun and it wouldn't run when we test it, we can give them a loaner and take the item in for repairs as long as it is within a certain time frame of the purchase. 

Most customers didn't like this option, for many reasons but the main one is that they couldn't get free items that way. This was super common and I think in the year and a half that I worked returns, only 1 person took me up on the repair option. The rest went with either, ""just give me my cash back"" or the ever classic, ""I want a new one of the same thing"". The first was easy to do, the second required a manager approval, even with a receipt, and they would try to talk them into doing the repair option, but that never worked.

Anyway, I had one customer though that knew of our repair policies and did he best to get around it and get a new mower each year. Since he would return the mower before the end of the applicable return policy, he would talk the managers into giving him a new mower for free each year, even before he got me the first time around. I still don't know how this a good business policy, if he is essentially stealing from us and never paying, but they told me to do it anyway. So I did.

But the following year, I was a little wiser to his and others schemes and had gotten good at talking customers either in circles or fixing the problem so they couldn't complain. \*note: most customers were decent and well meaning people, but there are the select few that try to rig the system\*

So the man walks in with his mower, or what I think is a mower as it is so bogged down with dead and dried up grass I can barely see the red paint underneath. He does his normal, ""I was mowing with it and it just stopped, I want a new one."" I offer him the repair option but he doesn't want to hear about it. So I go, ""Well, sir, I do have to inspect it first before I can return it, do you mind if I take it outside while I do that?"" He is confused but let's me do so.

I have repaired my old mower so many times at home now that I could pretty much be a mechanic for them somewhere, but this one was a different case. After cleaning it, I check the sparks, normal problem starter, they are good, practically pristine. I check power connections, they good. Motor, good and well oiled. Start up components, nice and well tuned. I can't figure it out. Until I pop the gas cap. Damn thing is bone dry. I rolled my eyes.

I come back in after roughly 10 minutes of checking and he goes ""can I just get a replacement mower for it now?""  But me being wise to him make an offer. ""Sir, I bet I can get it started in a minute. If I can, will you take it back?"" ""Uh, I mean, I guess, but what..?"" I don't let him finish as I pull a plastic gas carton out from behind my desk (one we use for filling up replacements) and put a little in the tank. Prime the motor and BAM! Its up and running like new again. 

""Here you go, sir! Its seems to be running just fine now. Can I help you with anything else today?"" He just stared at it dumbfounded for a couple of seconds before quietly wheeling it back out to his truck. To this day I wondered if he never thought I would try to refuel it first?",TalesFromRetail
t3_d974l0,The Dry Ice Man,"OK, first post on this sub, short time lurker.  Mobile format yadda yadda.

I have been working as a clerk at a very popular retail grocery store for about 3 months now. Now, our store does sell dry ice in a big freezer box in the front of the store, and it has a lock on it.  Obviously, only employees know the code to unlock it. This is one of two crazy weird customer experiences I have had.  This happened a out a month ago, so the order of which the ice man said the things he's said is most likely out of order, but he did say these exact things. 

Characters:

Me

ID: Ice dude

C: Checker

S: Supervisor

So anyway, I'm slaving away at the checkout lane, bagging for a customer, when I hear my name called out.  I look to the left and a checker is looking at me and mentioning to an older looking man, with slightly shaggy clothes and Grey frizzy hair.

C: HeG67, he needs some dry ice, can you get it for him?

Me: yeah I got it.

So, I walk up to meet the guy, and we start walking down to the ice chest, and this is where the conversation starts. 

Me: So sir, how much dry ice do you want?

ID: Oh don't worry about it, I can get it myself.

Me: Oh, I'm sorry sir, but I just need to know how much ice you need.  Also, the ice chest is locked.

ID: Oh don't worry, I've been doing this for 5 years every week.  You can go back to bagging.

Red flag #1: Not only are only the employees allowed to even touch the Dry Ice, but there is no way that this man has been doing this every week for 5 years before someone caught him. 

Me: Sorry sir, but I need to grab the ice for you.  Company policy.

ID: Well, I've done this in the past, look, I even brought a glove to help!

He pulls out a glove that was meant for grabbing the Dry Ice from his back pocket.

Me: I'll just get it for you, sir.

By this point, we had made it to the ice chest and I reached for the lock. 

ID (starting to sound flustered): Look, I don't need help, I got this, I k ow the code anyways.

Red Flag #2: What? No employee is allowed to give out the code for ANY lock in the store.  Whether he knew the code or was just bluffing, that freaked me out.

Me (ignoring his insistence and going to unlock the lock): how much dry ice do you want, sir?

ID: Idk, let me look to see how much you have.

Red Flag #3: OK man, how have you been doing this for 5 years and not know how much ice you get?  Now my spidey senses are going wild.

Me: Sir, I can't open the chest without knowing owing how much ice you want.

ID (clearly frustrated that I am following the rules): Again, I don't know how much I want, open it up so I can see what you have.

This goes back and forth for a minute or two, all the while I'm starting to freak out, because this is my first job, first interaction with this kind of customer.  Then, my savior, my Supervisor comes up.

S: What are you doing, HeG67?  Sir, can I help you? 

Me: I-

ID: I'm trying to get some dry ice, but this kid won't open the lock for me!

S: Okay sir (she motions for me to back off, so I re-lock the chest and slowly back up) how much ice do you want? 

He reiterates that he doesn't know, yadda yadda. He then just tells S that he'll get it. 

S: Sir, you're not allowed to get the ice on your own. 

ID: You know what?  Fine.  I'm not getting any ice, this is BS.  I've been doing this for five years, I'm never coming back here again! 

S: OK, bye now! 

ID barges out of the store yelling obscenities at us all the way until the door closes.  S and I make eye contact, with me wide eyed and unable to comprehend what just happened. 

S: It's OK HeG67, just go back to bagging.

Me: Yup!
Hope this doesn't break any rules.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d95xac,Actually This Story Is Kind Of Uplifting,"This may have been made up by the woman to give us hope, but I'll be damned if it isn't a beautiful story.

I was checking sales at the till, while one of my cashiers was open beside me.

A man comes through her line with an exchange from a month ago. She tells him she cannot take it, as our limit is 7 days. The man got upset at her but she wasn't about to budge, bless her stubbornness for rude asses (I backed her up, as her equally stubborn supervisor). He leaves pissed off that his tantrum wasn't rewarded, and a woman and her friend come through next.

This woman says, ""whenever someone does that to you, tell them you're not here to do your job quickly, but to do your job right"".

My cashier agrees that this is how she works, and shes not working minimum wage to be shoved around. The woman then launches into a story...

Her husband was a passenger, and during the flight, the engine had a massive failure and he crash landed into a lake. He and the pilot drowned, and were found 8 days later. The oil in the plane was found to be long due for a change, and nobody had been checking the plane whatsoever.

A completely avoidable accident took her husband's life, and she was devastated.

She was told there was a double rainbow over the lake the day her husband was found; one for the pilot, and one for her love. Well, one year later, she was mourning the loss as she visited his grave, and... what else does she see across the sky, but a double rainbow! Her husband was watching over her!

She said the double rainbow changed her whole life. She told us, ""Every time it rains on me, someone wishes me a long life. Every time I find a coin on the ground, someone wishes me good fortune. And every time I see a double rainbow... I remember to love those around me.""

Again, no idea if she just made this up to be motivational, but I'll be damned if she didn't speak with her heart, and I will be DAMNED if she didn't make my cashier, myself, and her friend beside her all tear up a little.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d8z700,It's Store Policy,"So I worked at a second hand store, got laid off earlier this year but thats a story for another time. I was a Cashier and we had some simple rules that were even pasted on the registers for everyone to see. One of these rules was that there were to be no open bags in the store, such as backpacks, grocery store or mini mart bags, or garbage bags. We do allow them to keep the bags at the front of the store, but don't take responsibility if anything is stolen. So one day, about a good three or four days after I finished my training to run the front. This old man comes in with two plastic bags, which is against the rules so I had to confront him, the rest goes as followed.  
GD: Grumpy Dude  Me: Me

Me: Sir, we can't allow open bags in the store. If you like you can leave them behind the register and I can try to keep an eye on them for you.

GD puts only one of his two bags down that was more full and tries to take an empty one.

Me: Sir, you have to leave both bags before I can let you move around the store.

GD: Oh this bag is mostly empty, I don't have anything in it.

Me: I see that Sir, but that does mean I have to make sure you leave the bags up here.

GD: But there is  hardly anything in it! I shouldn't have to leave it!

Me: Sir, the fact that you're telling me it's empty only gives me more reason to ask you leave it here. People steal from this store because we don't have detectors, it's for the safety of the store.

GD is now clearly upset and starts to raise his voice loud enough for the people in the back to here

GD: You motherfucker! You just don't want me taking my belongings around the store!

At this point I'm feeling a little overwhelmed but kept my cool

Me: I understand you're upset Sir, but you just have to leave you bags up here.

GD: Fuck you! You motherfucker! I'm never going to shop here again!

My manager came up to see what was going on as GD was grabbing his stuff

Me: I understand you're upset Sir, and I think it's fine that you decide not to shop here. Have a nice day.

GD left, I told my manager what happened and she said he's not gonna be allowed in the store anymore, then covered for me so I could get my break in.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d8qan0,Customer wants to stick his head in the baler,"I work at a big office supply store, usually on the floor doing logistics and stock but this particular day two cashiers called in and I was stuck at the front register for the day. This was on a particularly busy day, I had 4 customers in line, and the person who was my back up was busy helping a customer with a printer. I have two customers left in line when the mail guy comes, I'm about to go to sign off for a couple packages he leaves but he stops me and says ""these don't need signing, I can tell you're busy"" and walks out.

A few minutes later a middle aged couple walks into the store, looks down at the packages left by the mail man and kicks them... twice.... 

Me: oh, hi can I help you find something? 

Lady: yes, we want boxes like these. For mailing smaller things

Me: of course! Those are in aisle 15!

Lady: oh! You have them for customers? Like just to take? 

Me: ... we sell them if that's what you mean, you take them when you pay for them. 

Husband: oh,  well what about boxes you get things delivered in? Do you not give them to customers when you empty them out? Could you maybe empty these out and we can have the boxes? Or the boxes that you get stock delivered in.

Me: sorry, unfortunately it has to be my manager to open the mail, and he's busy right now. And we don't get stock delivered in cardboard boxes, we get them in plastic bins that we send back and reuse. When we do get cardboard boxes, we put them right in the baler so they dont take up space in our receiving area.

Husband: that's ridiculous,  can I go back there and take a look at the baler? In case they haven't crushed them today

Me: ... you want to go in our receiving area? 

Husband: yes, I want to see if you have boxes back there! 

Me: I'm sorry sir, I cant let you back there for multiple legal reasons, but as I mentioned, we have boxes that size for about two dollars in aisle 15. 

Husband: okay fine, we'll go take a look. 
They walk away muttering about how little help I am and how ""it's a frickin box, why cant they just give it away, why do we have to pay for a box.""

About five minutes later the husband come back up front on his own, when he thinks I'm not looking he goes around the register that's furthest from mine and starts looking at a box that we use to hold recyclable ink cartridges. 

Me: sir, I can not have you looking around back here and especially not touching ink cartridges that could explode on you. 

As I'm saying this this, I look to the back of the store and see that the wife is sticking her head through the doors that lead to the receiving area. It was like telling kids to not do something only to have them go and try to do that exact thing. So at this point I grab my mic and talk loudly into it, enough for the husband and customers in line to hear it: 

*I have two customers going into employees only areas, after I already asked them not to. One is up front behind the register and another is in the back, near receiving* 

The husband turned bright red and shuffled out from behind the register to collect his wife from the back of the store. They both stormed out of the store, but not before trying to grab boxes that we have at the entrance for customers that come in to recycle old printers and other such things. They gave up when they realized the boxes are glued to eachother, and walked out of the store like scorned puppies.",TalesFromRetail

t3_d8i8fr,"""I'm going to call head office on you for catching me stealing!""","This just happened tonight, I'm still laughing about it, so I thought Reddit might want to laugh about it too. (Forgive formatting or punctuation ect, I'm on mobile.)

M: Me 

T: Tag-swapping idiot. 

I work in a store that has a HORRIBLE problem for stealing as it is a thrift store on a rather bad end of town. ANYWAYS;

I'm currently taking a course to become a security guard, so being able to stop shoplifting is really fulfilling for me. So, of course I see this guy with a HUGE hood (couldn't even see his face) and a backpack. Usually a backpack in this store is enough to keep an eye out. 

I'm working fitting rooms, and we have a company wide policy that you need to count the customers items before they go in, and you can only take 6 items in. Anyways, this guy tells me he has 6, I tell him I need to physically count them (people put shirts inside shirts all the time so feeling the clothing is important.) He is already irritated at this, but complies, jokes on me, he has 8, so that's yet another red flag. A looonngggg time passes, way too much for 6 items, and he basically throws about half the items at me, and rushes to the register. As I start putting the clothing on the rack, I see a low end brand item tagged with a high price, a usual sign it has been ""tag-swapped"" (happens super often, people putting a $2 tag on something Nike for example so they don't have to pay $10). Also, our tags are designed so they can't be ripped off without destroying the tag, so you can tell it has been swapped pretty easily. Of course, all the items he gave me have ripped up tags that are not the price they should be. I get excited, show my manager, and she knows it makes me happy to call people out for this so she lets me handle it. 
Poor girl at the register is brand new and has already finished scanning his items, so I ask to her stop for a second and plop the entire pile of clothes he threw at me in front of him. 

M: ""None of these tags are correct unfortunately, so I'm going to have to re-tag them so they are the correct price."" 

T:""How do you know?""

M:""I'm actually not supposed to tell you how I can tell, but our company reserves the right to correct tags that are not correct at any time.""

T:""Well that's something your company should work on, because I didn't do anything with the tags."" 

M:""Oh, should we? Hey (manager), it seems we need to work on tagging items correctly. Either way, I need to re-tag all of these items."" Infuriatingly, we are not allowed to accuse anyone of anything, so I can only re-tag the items and hopefully he will learn his lesson. 

T:""Well then, I only want these jeans, how much will they be?"" He is being super rude at this point. 
I look at all the tags I grabbed off the other clothes he swapped with, only one says jeans, roughly $16. 

M:""Seems this was the original tag, as I can see this hoodie shouldn't have a jeans tag."" 

T:""fine, but just so you know, I'll be calling head office."" 

I proudly display my name tag to him so he can see my name, and inform the manager, to which she accidentally laughs out loud, as she knows everything is happening. It was an honest accident, don't hate on my manager lol, she's awesome. 
He left with just one item, and left me with at least 8 items, all with wrong tags, only to anticipate an amazing call/meeting with head office about stoping a shoplifter. I know he won't call, but part of me really really wants him to. I did everything right, didn't accuse him, just reserved my right as an employee, and stopped a ahop-lifter. Try me, buddy.

Cast: me, Aggressive Lady (AL) with a minor appearance form my manager

I was stocking candy when a customer came up and asked if we had iphones. Given where I work I assumed she meant the chargers and said no. 

AL: I meant the iphone chargers.

me: I guessed as much. No we don't.

AL: Alright. Why'd you disrespect my mom?

My brain basically shut down for a few seconds because what the fuck? and where the fuck did that come from?

me: Um, what?

AL: *aggressively jabbing her finger in my direction* My mom told me that *you* banned her and I want to know why!

me: Um... I don't have the power to ban people from the store, so...

AL: Then why was she banned?!

me: I don't even know who your mom is, so I can't tell you.

AL: *pounding her fist against her palm* I just want to know who disrespected my mom because I'm about to disrespect them!

me: Like I said, I don't even know who your mom is, so I can't tell who banned her or why she was banned in the first place.

AL: That's fine. I live in the area so I'll be back.

She left after she said that and I immediately went to go relay this story to my manager.
 
Then, while pounding her fist against her palm, she was like, ""I just want to know who disrespected my mom, because I'm about to disrespect them!"" I told her that I didn't even know who her mom was and she said that was fine because she lived in the area and she'd be back before walking out.

I went to manager to tell her all this and she said that we only have three women banned from the store (the majority of our ban list is kids/teenagers who steal candy) and we're pretty sure none of them are her mom. Plus there's only one woman I've personally had problems with and she's almost definitely related to the girl in question so like....... bruh.

I have a felling that girl's probably gonna get banned from the store too once my manager sees her in person, because she's a good manager who doesn't take any shit and won't let *us* be disrespected.

t3_d87qpr,"He Was Able To Pay, He Just Didn't Want To"," So, not a massive or impressive story, but one that filled me with disgust anyway.

A guy came up to the registers with three small housewares items, totaling $1.75.

The guy rummages in his pockets, and clatters down $1.50 in quarters, two dimes.... and FOUR pennies.

&gt;Man: ""Well, looks like I've only got $1.74. You can take that, right?"" He gives me a tiny smirk, automatically assuming that I could.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me, apologetically, ""No sir, I'm sorry, but I can't.""

His smirk dies.

&gt;Man: ""Well, do you have one of those coin trays?""

(Aka the give a penny, take a penny thing.)

&gt;Me: ""No, sir. We don't have one of those.""   
&gt;  
&gt;Man: ""Why not?!""

I explain. To sum it up, our money goes to a local No-Kill animal shelter for surrendered pets and strays. We make money off items sold, and we have little house shaped banks to take dollar bills, and a pair of Big Belly Banks -- one penguin, one begging dog -- for coins, which kids and even adults love. Any declined change goes straight into these banks as a direct donation.

&gt;Man: ""That's ridiculous. You should just have a tray for loose change!""

He then drops a dime on the counter.

Now... here's the thing... he didn't rummage in his pocket to try to scrounge up what he owed. He made no effort to LOOK for more money. He literally had the dime in his palm the ENTIRE TIME he was trying to get me to accept a penny less for what he was buying.

I don't say the half dozen smart mouthed things that flew through my head as I made the nickel in change for him.

&gt;He retorts, in what is clearly a Direct Order From His High And Mighty-ness, ""Just keep the nickel and use it to spot someone else who is short! I can't believe you won't take a freaking penny less!""  
&gt;  
&gt;Me, poo-eating grin, calling out as he stomps out the door, ""The homeless animals thank you for your donation, sir! I'm sure they appreciate you not STEALING MONEY from them!""

Maybe petty. Maybe passive aggressive. But I don't regret a word of it. 

**Epilogue:** I fed the penguin bank his nickel at the end of the night. Oddly enough, no one else had the gall to try to short change our charity.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d8j8ma,Maybe you should just show up at the time the order is supposed to be ready!,"Right, so this is my first post here, sorry if the formatting isn't up to par.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have this story I wanted to share. It's nothing too dramatic or outlandish, but it's those kinds of things that make you cynical about people when you think about the fact that they act like the world revolves around them.

So I work at a grocery store that I'm not at liberty to identify. I work in the deli section of the store, which is usually the busiest part. While most of our customers are okay, with some that actually treat us like human beings and not robots, there are some that are less than friendly. I'm sure everyone knows what I'm talking about.

It was noon on Sunday, and of course, that means that everyone and their mother is raiding the deli like flies to a pile of brown bodily waste. Lines as far as the eye can see on the slicers, sub shop, and the hot case. Not only that, but we also have a ton of online orders that we need to push out on time. Customers choose the time they want the order to be ready, but it always has to be thirty minutes in advance of the time it was ordered and printed out on our end. While they are are a huge pain sometimes, I like to remind myself that if we didn't have that, they would all be customers added onto the lines, so it would be completely unmanageable.

I was personally completing the sub orders we had at the time, churning them out at a reasonable pace. I wasn't getting too swamped, thankfully. I get one order that's due at 2:00, and since I finished all the other orders I had at the time, I get started at around 1:40. Normally I could get it out around 1:50, but there were two subs I had to complete, and we were already running low on the sub kits they requested. I only had one whole sub kit, so I needed another one. It was the store brand, so normally we have them presliced from a special section in the distribution warehouse, but unfortunately, we were completely out of them, so I had to slice it manually. It's also three different types of meat combined, so it takes even longer than a normal sub kit. It takes me about three minutes to take the meats out, slice them, weigh the kit so that I'm not using too much, and then wrap them all up. Then I get asked to help out a few customers since we're absolutely packed. I could have just said I'm doing an online order, but I figured I have enough time to get the subs done since they were both the same and they weren't too complicated. Plus I don't like to leave my coworkers in a lurch. I help around three customers for about nine minutes, putting the time to around 1:52. I can still do the subs in eight minutes.

Once I finished with the last customer I helped, I went right back to the subs. Once I got the meats and condiments on the bread, I found that I needed eight slices of provolone cheese for the subs. I go over to the sub shop, but find that the provolone I had sliced like fifteen minutes back was all gone. *Wonderful.* I go ahead and take out the provolone from the case again, and I end up waiting two minutes before I can even slice enough provolone for me and the sub shop, since everyone else is using the cheese slicers we have. I get a large stack of provolone sliced up, take what I need, drop the rest off at the sub shop, and then go back to making the subs. Little did I know, the customer that ordered the subs showed up around 1:54. She just waited there and didn't bother to tell anyone until about two minutes before 2:00. When she did, she complained to one of the other associates there at the time that she needed the subs as soon as she got there, but the time on the ticket said 2:00 *sharp*, no later. That associate went ahead and told me that she was complaining about the subs.

Now look, if someone shows up early, and they're cool about it, I'll work with them and try to get it out as fast as I can. I really don't mind doing that because we're supposed to provide excellent service. She, on the other hand, was raising a stink about how I didn't get it out fast enough, yet she was the one that was early by six whole minutes. Any other normal person would have simply waited there until we got the subs out on time, but apparently she's so important that we needed to get it out on her own schedule, even though she chose the time when she ordered the sub. If she simply just showed up at the time she set, the subs would be ready. So now that she's complaining, I need to hurry and complete the subs at her convenience when we're still packed. Of course, I didn't do that as a favor, I did it because I just want to get her out as fast as I can. I get them done at 1:59 on the dot. The associate that heard the complaint also went ahead and changed the prices on the subs, taking a dollar off for the ""inconvenience"", which I really didn't like because it just rewards bad behavior, but that's beside the point. I get the subs wrapped up and packaged, and when I go to hand it off to the customer, she's gone like a fart in the wind. I'm left standing there for a minute with two subs in my hand, looking like an idiot while I try to find the customer. Like wow, if you're in such a hurry to get the subs, why the *hecc* would you just leave in order to do something else? Not only that, we're not exactly empty considering *everyone* wants sliced meats, subs, etc. Anyone else would have understood that we're in the fecal matter.

So now I figured she probably went to customer service to complain, so I go ahead and walk over to the little refrigerator we have to place the subs in there until she comes back. Lo and behold, she does. The associate that talked to her lets me know that she did, so I go ahead and hand the subs over to him because I don't even want to look at her face. He gets that I'm pretty annoyed by the customer, so he goes ahead and hands the subs off to her. Of course, she just takes the subs and then just walks away. Oddly enough, she didn't exactly look like she was in a rush. We then talked about how that customer was full of it for a minute, and then went back to the grind.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, there you go. Sorry if it was too wordy, but I tend to include quite a few details when I write. As I said, it wasn't really crazy or anything, but it's those kinds of things that make the job a hassle. Sorry about no dialogue either, I didn't listen in to the conversation because the whole place was nothing but a sea of people chattering. It probably wasn't anything important.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d8gpy9,“I only have pennies...sorry”,"I’ve worked for a decently sized farm store chain for about 3 years now. This happened back when I was about a month in. 

(For reference, my store is small. It only has two registers and, therefore, two tills. I don’t get my own till and I can hop to either when ever I need/want to.)

I was opening with one other manager who was busy stocking feed shelves while I was put on register. About an hour after we opened, an older customer walks in and I can hear the immense amount of coins jingling in her purse. The woman couldn’t have been younger than 60 so I just assumed she was one of those people that liked to carry coins on them. She didn’t seem like she was struggling to carry her purse so I thought nothing of it and welcomed her in.

The lady walks around the store for about 10 minutes (the entire time she’s the only one in the building other than me and my manager) and eventually brings up a couple bones for her dog. I scan them and give her her total: around $10 with tax. 

Hearing this she heaves her purse onto the counter and it lands with a hefty thud. I’m startled, she’s unfazed and tips it over to pull out a gallon sized zip-lock bag full of pennies. 

“This is all I have...is that okay?” 

Internally I’m screaming “Wtf?! NO! There are multiple banks a mile down the road. Why didn’t you trade these in for bills?” Instead I sheepishly told her it was okay and had to count them by hand. She tried to help but I told her to just not and let me take care of it since I didn’t want her to miscount (I didn’t think she would but I didn’t want to get in trouble if she did). 

Counting out the total took about 10 minutes and left her bag almost completely empty. She took her bones and receipt and left with a smile. I was still screaming at her mentally. 

Her pennies filled up both the penny trays and extra coin trays in both tills, and we still had to put some in the store’s safe cause we had no where else to put them. I got multiple comments about the amount of coins in each till by customers who noticed. 

In the three years I’ve been here since then I haven’t seen her again. I’m not exactly sad about that either.",TalesFromRetail

So I was helping the managers close up and a lady comes in with a giant basket of returns from the WRONG STORE. The items in question are sold only at the dollar store and there’s one not too far from my workplace. 

Customer: “I’d like to make a couple returns.”

Me: “Okay sure.”

She takes the dollar store bag and dumps the small “bottles” (??) on the counter. I ask if she has a receipt and she pulls out a receipt for my store but it’s over a month old. I scan the barcode on the receipt and scan the bottle.

As I knew it would happen:

“NOT ON FILE” appears on the screen.

Me: Ma’am I’ll show you my register screen but these bottles aren’t on file. We don’t sell these. 

Customer: No I’m pretty sure I bought these here. Your register is wrong. 

Customer: cAn i SpEaK To yoUr ManAgEr?

I call one of the managers up and they tell the customer the exact same thing. 

Manager: Ma’am I’m sorry but we don’t sell these here but the dollar store does. Take a look at your bag.

She looks on the bag and looks at the dollar store logo for a couple seconds and goes—

t3_d7z9ny,"No ma'am, other retailers can't see our stock. Go ahead, you can call corporate.","I started working at a large electronics retailer recently and I've enjoyed being able to pass off any customer I don't want to deal with to my boss while I'm training. Today, I got to sit back and watch while they interacted.

The lady comes in, already looking somewhat cross, carrying an old Dell Inspiron from around 2012 or so, and starts demanding to see our batteries. I told her that I don't believe we carry those in store, but I'd be happy to help her order one online. She immediately started yelling at me, telling me that we did have it, and demanding to see a manager. He was standing right behind me, talking with the tech support team for a client's computer repair. He puts them on hold and tells her the same thing I just said, and asks where she saw we had it.

Apparently, an employee at another electronics retailer told her we had one. Not another location of the same chain, but a completely different store. My manager tried to explain that we don't carry any sort of laptop batteries in store, much less for such an old model, when she starts going off on him for being rude and ""chit chatting on the phone"". She takes his picture and says she's going to call corporate for his rude behavior, and asks to see the manager again, I guess not believing he was the manager. Then she demands his name and employee ID. He gives her his name, but refuses to give her his employee ID (which we use to access all sorts of private information), so she goes off on him again about how we are giving poor customer service and it's public information, before storming out of the store, yelling how she's going to get him fired.

t3_d87710,"Sorry, I can't accept that much change","My store has strict no paying in loose change policy.  $5 is store policy. Most of us will bend it to about $7 but no more.  There's a 2 fold reason for this.  

1) we only count loose change once a week and more than $5 extra in loose change throws the daily till count way off.

2) the weight of too much loose change will literally break our tills.  A coworker took pity on a customer last week and took $19 in loose change and about an hour after, her drawer wouldn't shut and we found the weight had broke the tracks.  Register out of commission for 3 days waiting on replacement parts.

Now, on to the story.  

Lady comes up, doesn't look like a typical Karen.  She's wearing a tshirt from a local event and usually this group is extremely friendly.  She unloads her cart, makes small talk...

Me: so, your total today is $74.96. We are doing a donation drive and asking for you to round up to the next dollar.  Those 4 cents will go to [charity] in [next town over].  Their location services their town and ours.  

Lady:  sure.

Me: okay so that rounds up to an even $75. 

And she pulls a jar out of her rather large purse.  It's filled with loose change.  She started to dump it out...

Me: Oh, I'm sorry but store policy is no more than $5 in loose change.  We have a Coin Star machine over by the customer service desk.

Lady: No.  You have to take this.  It's the law.

Me: No, ma'am, actually a business can decide what forms of currency they will take. Some places will not take bills larger than $20. We cannot take more than $5 in change.  If you want to roll it or use the Coin Star, we will accept it then.

Lady: NO!  I'm not paying that machine 12% of this!

Me: I'm sorry but that is policy.

Lady: Manager. Now.

Me: *points to name tag* That would be me at this time.  

Lady: That doesn't say manager.  That says *lead*. My horses have leads so what does that make you?

Me: Our store doesn't use the term manager.  We are leads, as in leading our departments and fellow employees in good customer service.  

Lady: *snorts* Whatever.  You're just as cashier trying to be something you're not.   Give me your '*leader*' then.

Fine.  Pages for store manager...excuse me...store leader...to come to my register.

Lady started yelling immediately about how I'm refusing her service and she isn't having it.  We have to take her money or she will call corporate and the IRS(????) for us refusing to take her money, it doesn't matter what form it is in.  

Boss: Well, this is my store, my employee, my policy.  You can take it home and roll it, you can take it to the machine then use the voucher or take it to your bank.  That's your options.  My tills will not hold extra loose change.

Lady: I can't believe your willing to lose a customer over this.  Screw it. I'm out of here.

With that she walked away.  Figure she won't be back.  

20 minutes later, bagger comes back from doing her take back and we hear the Coin Star.

We looked at each other...you don't think...naw...couldn't be...

It was.  

40 minutes after we heard the Coin Star starting, we hear it winding down.

Over an hour after her leaving, she is back in my line.   

Lady: Fine.  I went to your damn machine.  It cost me over $200.  Where's my stuff?  

Me: Unfortunately, another of our policies is to only hold groceries for 20 minutes.  It's been over an hour.  It's been taken back.  

Lady:  WHAT???

Me: let me call someone. 

Quickly inform boss.

Boss to lady: if you will give me your list, you can wait in my office while I collect your items.

Lady:  NO.  I JUST WANT MY DAMN MONEY NOW AND THE FEE YOU SCREWED ME OUT OF 

Coin Star voucher was over $1700. Yes, she had that much in quarters in jars in her purse.  

ETA: I re-read this and realized I didn't type what I thought I had.  I did type *in her purse* but what it was supposed to say was *in her purse and I'm hoping/assuming in her car*. That will teach me to attempt to write a post, get a child ready for school and feed/water/potty my pack of dogs.

Me: excuse me mate, can i help you?

C: yeah, i here to pick up an order.

Me: no worries, do you have your order form?

C gives me to form.

Me: thanks mate, ill bring it out, but can i get you to wait outside. Cant have you in here.

C: yeah okay mate.

I go and grab some CWs to help as the order was at least 25 items long and i wanted it to get out asap.
I get some items and go to the truck that C had driven, to load him up and i fimd he still wandering around and looking at the stock (which are just boxes with codes on them)

Me: mate i really need you to wait outside. Please step outside.

C: oh sorry, its a little cold and i wanted to get out of the weather.

Me: well you cant wait in here. Im sorry but youll have to wait outside or in your car.

I loaded his truck and go back to get some more items for his order and inform the boss that we may have some trouble with the customer but ill handle it.

I go back out with the last of his items as CWs have been loading the rest while i spoke to the boss and i find C still im the warehouse but this time he was all the way on the otherside trying to hide when i walked past.

Me: mate you need to leave now. Im not going to ask again

C: its cold outside. Just trying to get warm. No need to be rude.

Me: then why are you all the way over here? No way its just to get warm, please follow me to the door and ill load you up so you can go.

C: okay lets go.

We get over to his truck and i put the last items in and tell him i just need to get a pen for him to sign the dotted line (to comfirm his received his furniture)

Im gone for all of 2 minutes and i find C inside again, this time even further from the door.
I grab some CWs and tell them to go to door and wait for me.

Me: look mate, you need to leave. I asked you multiple times to wait outside. Now get out.

C: dont be rude im a customer. Im allowed to look at this stuff as ive brought them and i wanted to make sure they are stored correctly.

Me: okay, you wanna be like this. Fine we'll do it your way. 1 Your not a customer at (name) your a customer of (name) we operate as an independent business (same name, same business, same owners but its for tax reasons of something im not payed enough to understand)
2 your not allowed to step foot in the warehouse for any reason.
3 now get the hell out now.

C:your so rude im going to file a complaint.

Me: do what you want as long as you leave.

He finally starts walking to the exit, we get to the door and i tell CWs to unload everything off the truck.

C: WAIT! What are you doing!?! Its my stuff. You cant take it.

Me: you can pay for delivery. Itll be $320 and itll arranged for 2 days time. Now leave. I will not ask again.

C: but its my st...

Me: LEAVE!

He finally gets it and leaves. Just tk double check we get everything i did a count and noticed that we pulled off two extra items that werent on his list.
He called my boss and complained.

B: hey 'Halt' can i see you for a minute

Me: sure.

B: i just had a customer call and complained that you were rude and refused to give him his items or even look for them and now your making him pay for delivery.

Me: no. I loaded his truck up but i found him in the warehouse multiple times and asked him to wait outside, he refused to listen and so i told him to he can get his order delivered and unloaded his truck.

B:i figured he was twisting the story. I just have to ask or else the big bosses will get all pissy. 
did you count what came off?

Me: yeah and we pulled two extra items off that we didnt load.

B: were they his?

Me: no not on the list and the truck was empty when He arrived.

B: i would cancel his order but its to big of an order. Ill just pass it on the head office.


Anticlimactic ending but boy do customers that dont follow simple rules annoy me so much.

Ill update if any thing more comes off it.

t3_d85a23,Where's my recite?!,"Long time lurker, first time poster, English is not my first language and I'm on mobile yada yada yada

A bit background: I work in a small store and have been doing so for about 2 weeks, so I'm fairly new to the system at the register as I also just got introduced to it last week. I wear a pin saying I'm new but I really do try my best to not make mistakes.

So today I'm suiting at the register and doing my thing and everything is going great, besides some barcodes that aren't working (sigh). Out from the back of the line a lady starts calling me, demanding I go help her find something. I obviously can't since there's a line. Call someone over and I think that's done with. 

Once she's at the register and getting her things checked out she also seems fine. I finish up she pays and I ask if she wants the receipt . I don't know if she didn't hear me or didn't register but she says no. I wish her a good day and start checking out the next in line. 

This is when the woman gets mad. She wants her receipt. I say sorry but I thought you said no when I asked. She freaks and says I never asked and demands the receipt. As I'm in the middle of checking someone out then I can't give her her receipt unless I finish up the next customer or call my boss to cancel the entire checkout for the next customer. The woman in checking out have only a few items left so I apologize and tell the angry one that she'll have to wait 30 sec and then I'll be able to access her receipt. She flips even more now yelling how unfair that is. I finish the checkout and find the receipt in the system and she hufs and pufs and goes over to another register to pack up her groceries. The woman that was behind her reassures me that she also heard the woman say no.

Angry woman then goes one of my coworkers and rants about me loud enough so that I can hear and wants me disciplined or fired for my unprofessional way of handling the receipt. Then she goes silent and storms out of the store. 

I didn't hear anything bad from my coworker but it really put a damper on my mood to the point where I was almost crying.

I work in a chain supermarket, no deli or anything like that but it's pretty big and quite cheap. I'm on tills for the start of shift, all is normal till a woman comes up with about $50 in groceries.

Although she dumped them all on my tread the moment she arrived, she waited until it was her turn to suddenly sort through them and put 'priority' items first. I just had to sit and wait while she held everyone up.

I smile, ask her 'Is there an amount you need to stay below? I can keep an eye on the total for you' .

She shoved a plastic bag in my face to scan and kinda yelled 'I Sorted It! Just Scan THESE First!' while pointy at the front of her pile.

I'm scanning and all seems to be going well untill she suddenly snaps and tells me to stop half way through.

'That's enough! I have a budget I need to stick to!'. I smile and say 'no worries' while looking at the pile of stuff I'd now have to return.

She bags, pays on card and I think we're done when she then suddenly pulls out a mountain of spare change. I quickley cup my hands to take and count it for her but she ignores this and instead slaps it down on the counter, sending change all over.

'How much is that!?' she snapped, pointing at the pre packaged apples she brought up.

'$2' - me

'and 'ow much is dat!?' she pointed a prepackaged bad of mandarins.

'2.49'

'How much are they TOGETHER!?' she rolled her eyes, as if I was the one being inconvenient.

'... 2 plus 2.49 is $4.49'


She starts pushing change around despite a $2 coin sitting right in front of her.

'Would you like me to count up this change? We can work out how much there is then an-' I begind but she again cuts me off and says 'JUST DO WHAT I TELL YOU!' right in my face.

I just lean back and let her waste her time while everyone glares at her, she ended up paying 3 more things out of her spare pile but insisted on doing each item one at a time cause she refuse\couldnt up the total change.


When she finally finished, I smiled and thanked her, said i hope she has a great day ect.

On the day she came in to purchase the flooring my boss was out of the office, so I’ve been in the showroom all day by myself. This lady, annnnd that’s being *generous*, was yelling and being so offensive and so far *beyond rude* you’d need a map to get back to civility.


- She had a problem with having to buy more tiles than she needed. Boxes have a set amount of square feet. You can’t break them up. She should know this.
- She was angry about the flat-rate freight charge claiming she’d rather drive to [distribution center located 3 hours away] and pick it up herself. No. Absolutely *no way* am I subjecting my distributor to her tantrums.
- She called her husband a total of *4 times* complaining and cursing about me right in front of my face.
- She kept asking me questions about the process, timeframe, freight, etc.
- She interrupted. Every. Single. Answer. To. Every. Question. She. Asked.


She has been yelling for a solid 5 minutes when I finally picked my jaw up off the floor. Y'all, I LOST it. It’s one of the few times I’ve lost it, *especially* with a customer.  I’m a mellow person and I hardly ever speak to people like this. It takes *a lot* to offend me.  I’m a petite woman and often appear vulnerable, which is definitely *not* the word that anyone who knows me would use to describe me.  If I do happen to get angry, I have a low shiver-me-timbers-scary-whisper voice. And if you hear it, oh boy, you done messed something up good.


Lady:  I can’t *BELIEVE* how many *F-ING TIMES* I’ve come *HERE TODAY* and the store is *F-ING CLOSED!*  (Ha! Liar! I’ve been here all day!)  I have my *OWN*  business and if I ran *MY* compa - 


Me: Look lady. I think it would be a good idea for you to get your flooring from a different store.



Lady: I *CAN’T!!* I can't go somewhere *ELSE*!!! I was referred *HERE!!* I *F-ING HAVE* to get it from *YOU!!*


I’m positive I had a very confused look on my face because when I replied with:



Me: Let me get this straight... You’re treating me this way *and* you *want something from me?!*



She was incensed. 



Lady: *I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU F-ING PEOPLE!!  HOW F-ING HARD IS IT TO -* 



Oh, no. No, no, no. I don’t have security to call to help me. I have to deal with her myself and she clearly only speaks “scream.” 


I then slowly stood up from my desk, planted my hands on the table, and loomed my short little self over her, just to have my next statement sink in as deep as possible. I can dish it right back, should I need to. I have to, or I would be terrible at my job. Petite female + construction industry = Hard. In a calm and icy voice I instructed her that this is going to go *exactly* how I say. 


Me: You have 2 options. You can *sit down* and *shut up* or you can *get out*. If you want *me* to help *you*, you're going to lose the attitude *right now* or you can go throw a temper tantrum *somewhere else*. Can you do that? 


Lady: \*face puckered up like she’s been sucking on lemons for 30 years\* Whatever, I guess.


Me: NO. No *""whatever.""* No ""*I guess.*"" Is there going to be and issue again or can you park the attitude for *5 minutes*, so I can do my job *without* being verbally abused and assaulted? 



Lady: \*Catbuttface for daaaaays\* Fine.



She’s still acting rudely, complaining and mumbling that I need to hurry up because she “just wants to get her groceries home.” Seriously, lady? That's the motivation behind this BS? Seven times, she said this. Seven! I counted! Then please tell me *why* did you go grocery shopping *before* you came to order flooring?!  So, I finish writing up her order and she hands me money. As she’s leaving, she starts up again.



Lady: I’m *USUALLY* not a btch. I’m never *REALLY* a btch. I’m just *stressed out ,* so *THAT'S*  why I'm yelling, but I am *NOT* a btch.


Me: \*smh, chuckling\*  Sure, lady. Whatever, but I don’t buy that *for a second.* 



Lady: \*EPIC LEVELS OF CATBUTTFACE\*



Me: Yah know, you catch more flies with honey....just saying. (I know I shouldn’t have said this, but why not at this point.)



Lady: YEAH WELL I JUST - 



Me: *BYE!!!*



Lady: BUT YOU - 



Me: *GET. OUT. OF. MY. STORE.*


And she did.


She left having no idea when her flooring is being delivered.


A week later, her husband, who she was ~~earning a one way ticket to hell~~ running the errand for, came in waving the sales ticket inches from my face, like I'd EVER forget these people, to see when the flooring was going to arrive, because his wife surely doesn't know. *Maaaayyybeeee* in a few days, I say to myself. I hadn’t bothered to order it yet. It takes a day to ship so, I tell him the day after tomorrow. Now before y’all get cross with me for not ordering the material they paid for, I didn’t mess with the guy’s business. I knew what day he needed it by, and I definitely would have ordered it on time, but I was so appalled by her behavior that I put her on the back burner.


A couple days later, the husband’s employee comes in to pick it up. We shared an “I know, right?” look with each other. We definitely both have crazy bosses. He left, and my life went back to just it’s usual level of guano loco.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d7zlgh,"No, I can't access your info over the phone","I work in a phone store. One of our rules is we cannot pull up customer's info over the phone, they have to come in to be verified, or call 611, where the customer care team CAN verify their information over the phone.

So anyways, today I (M) was trying to communicate this to a customer (C).

C: calls saying they have an issue with their account

C: sounded confused but hung up pretty quickly. Called a few minutes later ""why cant you verify me over the phone? Anytime I have an issue I always get help on the phone!""

M: I understand sir, and you can get help over the phone, you just need to call 611 since theres no way I can verif-*click*

t3_d80li3,Yelled at for Helping,"I don’t understand people at times. 

A man came up to me asking where he could find hamburger buns. I told him it was with the bread, “where is the bread?” It is all the way in the bad. I even pointed. The man said he couldn’t hear me. 

I raised by voice believing I was not speaking loud enough, “Where is that?” Told him again by simply repeating myself and pointing. He was still confused and I repeated myself a few times and eventually he got me flustered to the point he no longer wanted to hear my answer. He told me he didn’t like my attitude and walked away.

This guy was simply lazy. I later heard him asking for the hamburger buns at the register. He made a scene for no reason. People were begging to stare at us while we talked.

What did I do he did not like? He asked a question and I gave him the answer. I try to be firm in my answers because many people get upset with being told we don’t have what they want.

t3_d7mle3,Lady had an imaginary conversation between herself and I,"Tonight was annoying for several reasons and this genius took the cake.  I answered her question twice about the x for $xx deal we had with the panties.  It wasn't hard to understand you got this many, for this price.  Onto the fun part....

I rang up customer with a few pairs of panties, then ordered one and our register gave her the deal automatically.  I said to her that she will see her in store stuff on one barcode, and ordered item above a different one, but the ending total and deal will still be the same.  Rang up her other items, she looked at the screen, paid, and left.  I then see an hour and a half later, my manager was on the phone with someone for 20 minutes, walking around, trying to figure something out.  I was busy tending to in-store customers.  

She tells me later the lady called to complain about me because, and I quote, ""the lady who rang me up told me my shirts were half off and they didn't come up that way now that I look at my receipt.  Also, (some other thing) was supposed to be on sale and it wasn't either.  I don't see where I got my x for $xx panties like she said!""  The funny part?  She never asked me about her other clothing items.  My manager asked me about the interaction and I told her all this.  Manager then says she knew the lady didn't have a clue because one of her items wasn't on sale, it was a completely different item type next to it with a sign, and she had to explain multiple times about the ordered vs. in-store totals, barcodes, and had to do the math for and with the woman.",TalesFromRetail

Simple stuff usually, like “do you carry this” or “how much does this cost”, easy stuff. A call comes, and I think it’s pretty standard stuff. So I answer the phone.

DISCLAIMER: This happened on Friday, so I’m retelling this to the best of my ability lol, I don’t remember word for word what she said.

LADY: Boomer 
Me: Employee 

LADY: Hello?

Me: Hi, this is XYZ Company, how can I help you?

LADY: Hi, I was calling to see if you guys sell table runners. 

Me: *looks it up on my scanner gun* No sorry, we don’t, it’s an online only product. But you could always order it online and have it delivered to our store :)

I’m hoping to shoo her off at this point.  We don’t sell them, none in the back, our store just doesn’t carry it.

LADY: Are you sure? I was there last month and you guys had it. 

Me: Yeah sorry, our store doesn’t carry them. Was there anything else you needed help with?

LADY: You know what, I’m going to come in there tomorrow and if I don’t find them, I’m reporting you. What’s your name?

At this point, I’m pretty pissed off, tired, and just bored. So I decide to fuck with her a little, knowing that she’s going to follow through on that threat.

I give her the name of one of my friends, who works at a completely unrelated retail chain. We’re going to call her Tammy. 

(Keep in mind there is no employee named Tammy at my store or team, so I know this is airtight.)

Me: My name is Tammy, Ma’am. 

LADY: Okay Tammy, I’ll see you tomorrow.

This happened before I came in, but according to the recount told by my one of my coworkers, she came in looking for ‘Tammy’, and insisted that it was Tammy who she talked to on the phone.

t3_d7o0et,One of our Regulars,"Sorry for the errors I am on mobile. I’m writing this at 4am because it’s keeping me awake. 

To preface the story this woman and her bf (mid 30s) come in all the time and they’re clearly stoned, drunk, high you name it they’ve been in the store under the effects of it. Her bf tries to play it cool but she can’t seem to not act like a child under any circumstance. 

I was having a terrible day at work. Garbage scheduling (nothing new), extra rude people giving me attitude over their errors, people being dumb. All that jazz. I happen to walk by one of our HBC aisles, which is ideally placed in the front of the store, and I happen to notice one customer on her knees holding a stack of shaving products, probably $50 worth. She was trying to adjust her purse to get them to fit in while hiding behind a 2 tier basket. Which is like hiding behind a chain link fence. You can see everything. 

It was like watching a toddler attempt to put a square peg into a round hole. She just couldn’t do it. I stood back and watched while she tried. After 10s I walked up and asked her if I could help her with anything. I saw the cogs in her brain work their hardest to not freak out and make a bs excuse. 

The first thing she told me was that she was trying to read the back of the items to get a better understanding of them. Mmhm, yea I didn’t know you need to be on your knees to do that. After that she let out nervous laugh and then told me she was about to ask me a stupid question. “Do you know anything about these products?”  I strait up said no. Unfortunately I was pulled aside by a self check out needing help to correct a mistake. I bolted back there but didn’t see her put everything away. Though I did see one item left behind on the top of the basket. 

After that she disappeared like a fart in the wind. We couldn’t find her. A few minutes later she and her bf came out of the men’s bathroom together. I can only imagine what they were doing in there. She began browsing the discount rack and was making a small scene with her bf. I pointed out who the attempted shoplifter was to my manager. We kept a close eye on her until she left. 

Oddly enough she came back into the store about an hour later but with her parents. She gunned back to that same aisle and told her mother she wanted her to buy the items she couldn’t steal. Sadly enough her mother who was in her 60s bought it all for her. She then checked the discount rack but decided against getting stuff seeing how she’d have to wait in a line. Nothing else happened after that. 

Hopefully she won’t show her face in the store again but I doubt it. I’ll keep my eyes peeled.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d7ikqo,"""You should find another job""","It's been a few weeks since this happened, but I'm over it. I work at a grocery store with online pickups where people pick their groceries up for **FREE**. No charges at all.

Well, on this fateful day, I was working the closing shift. We were horribly understaffed so I was working alone. We still have a few orders that haven't been picked yet for 8 to 10 and it was already 7pm when 3 customers came in at the same time. We have a first come, first serve basis so whoever calls our department for pickup first, gets their order first. It usually takes 3 - 10 minutes to load each customer (unless the system goes down and we have to manually scan each and every item which takes forever).  I also tell customers when there are people ahead of them so they know when they're gonna expect a few minutes of wait.

So, I start loading these 3 customers in order. Lady 1 was thankful for me loading her groceries into her trunk without having to get out. No problems at all. Mind you, it only took me 4 minutes to load her. Now I start loading Lady 2's groceries. I got to her car and she comes out. You can immediately see that she was in a bad mood. No worries, we all have our days, right?

**Lady 2**: ""Why did it take you so long to load my groceries?""

**Me**: ""I apologize, but I cannot get to everyone immediately. Lady 1 called first so she got her groceries first. Plus, I'm working alone right now"".

**Lady 2**: *sighs* ""Alright. Just load mine quick. I have to tuck my kids in soon.""

Reasonable enough. Let's say it took me between 7-10 minutes loading hers since it was a huge load. She thanked me and drove off. Now, I start loading Lady 3's order. She also had a huge order so it took me a couple of minutes to get to her. As I get her order out of our department's door, I see her stomping towards me. She was angry. I know she was, but I really wasn't expecting it. I was tired. I've been working since 12:00pm and I had to rush my lunch and not take any 15 minute breaks (atleast until the end of my shift where everything slows down). I wasn't able to say anything back until she took a deep breath after a few minutes of her rant.

**Lady 3**: *insert really long rant about how long her wait is, how she has chores to do still, and that we should compensate her for her time.*

**Me**: ""Miss, I'm really sorry about the long wait. I had to load to customers ahead of you and I'm currently alone-""

**Lady 3**: ""Well, maybe you should schedule more people then!""

**Me**: ""I can't do that, miss. I'm not the department manager, and I don't decide who works when.""

**Lady 3**: ""I don't care! I'm expecting a full refund for this. You and your department are incapable of accommodating your customer's needs!""

A full refund of 600$ worth of groceries with no pickup fees? For 15 minutes of her time?

**Me**: ""I can't issue you a full refund. I can get you a 10$ voucher for the inconvenience, but a full refund is impossible. And as I said earlier, I was working alone.""

**Lady 3**: ""You should find another job if you can't load all of us under 5 minutes. And if you won't issue the full refund, I'll take this to the head manager and I'm getting you fired!""

I just stood there, shocked. I wasn't able to respond at all.

**Lady 3**: ""Now put all my groceries into the back of the car. You've wasted too much of my time already! I hope they fire you.""

She went back into her car, and I just loaded her as fast as I could, cause I just don't wanna deal with this anymore. After she drove off, I sent an email to our department manager regarding this and they sent her a 25$ voucher cause ""customers are always right"".

Maybe I should really find another job...",TalesFromRetail
t3_d7ms5x,Angry Chicken Salad Wednesday,"Hey all,

Back story:

I work in a grocery store deli and I great quality equipment to work with in excellent condition, but now and again you'll have something out of your control like broken a slicer, fryer, or oven. In this case it was a broken salad case. we had to pull the salads from the front and not use them, except three different salads available while the case was broken. We still had customers ask about the salads. We just said we have three salads available at the moment due to the broken salad case Potato salad, Macaroni salad, and Chicken Caesar salad.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the Story:

It's been a few days and we're still waiting on the repair tech to come fix the salad case. A customer comes up and asks for some sliced meats and I slice the meats. The customer then asks ""do you guys have any of the salads today?"" ""yes sir, I do have a few salads available"" and that's where I made the mistake ""can I have chicken salad"" at this moment I knew I... HAD... DUN... GOOFED!!! I didn't say what salads we had available and now I'm going to die for it. ""I don't have chicken salad but I do..."" i was cut off mid sentence by the anger that ensued ""YOU DON'T HAVE CHICKEN SALAD, IT'S WEDNESDAY AND YOU DON'T CHICKEN SALAD"" this customer has just went from calm to over 9000 anger level. ""I'M GOING TO TO TO"" he picks up a sign and throws it at me I duck down and he walks away angry as HELL. I pick up the sign and place it back where it was and get on the phone with my manager to inform him what had just transpired in my deli after I get paged on the store intercom. 

I still wish the customer well and hold no hard feelings about what had happened. I'm just glad it didn't get worse that what is was.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d7kzvw,Power went out (:,"Last hour of work, everything was going great, aaaaand the power went out as I was about to swipe a debit card. I remembered her total, did a cash transaction instead, and waited for further instruction.

We waited, the power didn't come back on. So we instructed everybody to leave their things for us to put away. With no power, there's nothing we can do. It would have been too tedious and messy to ring up the items on a calculator.

You've already guessed what happened next. A little lady grabbed the last few items and tired to check out. I'm not sure she understood that the power went out, which is a bit saddening, but all I could do was try to reexplain. 

Her husband turned around and told her something along the lines of ""honey we'll come back for our things, it's time to go."" What a sweet old man.

She asked me to hold her items, but the senior cashier said it would be unfair to the others. She'll find them when we reopen.

Bonus story I already knew would happen:

After work, I went to grab the rest of my groceries. Working at a popular store in a small town, a lot of people see me daily-weekly. I knew all too well what was bound to happen.

A guy who was shopping with his family asked""Did the power ever come back on?"" ""Nope, but I figured someone here would ask. It's down for the day."" ""Oh well, we'll be back this week!"" And his family kept shopping.

I'll have to cash out the register when I come back to work. Oh well, it could have been a lot worse. Nobody got hurt, and we only had an hour left, if that. The timing could have been a lot worse than it was.",TalesFromRetail

t3_d7iktr,Just bad at shoplifting,"Long time lurker, first time poster. 

I work in an independent record store that sells a bit of everything: vinyl records, CDs, DVDs, cassettes, band shirts and memorabilia, all that stuff. Today, right when we opened, we had a particularly skeevy looking dude come in. He wandered around the store, picked up a few CDs and a T-shirt. He comes up to the front counter to check out and pays for his stuff but he sets off our alarm when he goes to walk out. So, my coworker, assuming she just forgot to zap an antitheft device, takes his bag and puts it on our demagnetiser and hands it back to him. He still beeps at the front door, which gets my manager's attention.

So she has him empty his pockets and walk through without the bag. Still beeps. At this point,  it's obvious that he's trying to steal something but he plays dumb. She asks him to show her his waistband, which he refuses. At this point, I look at my manager and mouth ""do you want me to call the cops?"". ""Not yet."" she mouthes back. While she's turned to me, he pulls an action figure from his waist and puts it on the counter. So there we have it. He tries to act like everything's fine.

Nah, bitch.

Our general manager is gung ho about us prosecuting shoplifters, so we call the cops. Which the guy is clearly not stoked about because he ""gave it back"" (the item he attempted to steal in the first place). Then he gives us a sob story about how he has a prior for vandalism and he'll go to jail if he gets caught for shop lifting. Which, I mean, c'mon. The fact that you're a career idiot doesn't make me feel bad for you. If you were stealing something essential like food for your family, I'd have a ton of sympathy. But nah, you stole a stupid plastic toy. 

The real kicker though: the item he attempted to steal has an obvious anti-theft device stuck to the back of it AND one of my coworkers knew the guy. Maybe consider shoplifting somewhere where they don't know you personally and/or consider stealing an item that isn't tagged.

But it's not like we could just hold him there so he runs out to his car and takes off. The cops come and we give them his description and his car's description - we're told an investigator will get into contact with us.

All of this happened within an hour of us being open. Weird Saturday, man.

We got our action figure back though.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d7jklk,Why isn't it working???,"So, hi it's me again. So for context to the story I am an 18 y/o male cashier for a popular North American clothing retailer, and am commonly listed as the top performer in credit card sales and in email capture. Again a disclaimer, I'm on my phone so I'm very sorry for the horrid formatting. 

Anywho, this is less a story than it is a common occurrence that truly confuses me, and I notice it especially when it's a slow day and nobody is in a hurry. Here, let me just show you this way...

Me: ""Hello, I hope you found everything alright today."" *At this point I'm already scanning and folding the items.*

C: ""Oh yes, thank you."" *Customer helps me to remove the hangers.*

At this point, if it's a short transaction we're already done, but I have a spiel that I have to say at some point of the transaction. Keep in mind on the card terminal there's a list of the items and the grand total.

Me: ""Alright so your grand total for today is going to be $69.69."" *Customer inserts card, staring at the terminal. I'm obviously not done talking, though.* ""However, if you'd like the price to be smaller, you can sign up for the brand credit card to get yourself about 42.0% off. It only takes about ninety seconds and offers--"" I'm often interrupted.

C: ""Why isn't it working? I put my card in.""

It's normally either that or *Swipes card, puts card away, then looks at me, wanting their bag.* (I don't bag items or give them to the customer until the items are paid for and a receipt is printed) Then after my spiel, I instruct them to slide or insert the card when the blue lights flash. And the FAQ for that scenario is 

C: ""Will this charge my card twice??""

And for those with the same question, no.. No, it won't. 

I don't know if at other retailers it automatically processes the card without a cashier pressing the go-ahead button but we always have to send the instructions to the terminal manually at all of these locations. And more often than not, these are regular customers. 

If someone could tell me if that's impatience or possibly a lack of understanding how the technology works, that'd be great. It doesn't really aggravate me, it's just so common, and it does slightly annoy me, but that's only when it's a busy day and it slows down the line.

t3_d6ykqg,“I Thought It Was A Fancy Humidifier!”,"So I work at an older women’s clothing store, and as many clothing stores do, we have an industrial steamer to get the wrinkles out of new products so they look presentable. We also have to steam the products next to the registers because we don’t have enough staff to be prepping things in the back. 

If you’ve never used a steamer before, they get insanely hot. You can very easily burn yourself if you’re not careful, even just putting it five inches away from your skin long enough can give you a nice red mark. 

Now onto the story, a younger girl and her friend were browsing products near our registers while I was steaming some shirts to be put out. I noticed one of the shirts was missing a sensor, so I turned to grab a set, and while I was walking the five steps back I noticed the girls making a beeline for the steamer.

I swear it was almost a slow motion moment, my brain couldn’t register fast enough that the girl was reaching to GRAB onto the steamers head! She held onto it for around 2 seconds before she yelped and jumped back, “Oh my god it’s hot!”

I stood there in disbelief for a second that this girl literally just decided to grab a steamer. “Are you okay?!” I said, still dumbstruck. 

“Yeah I’m fine, I just thought it was a fancy humidifier!” The girl and her friend turned to leave, laughing at what she just did the whole way out. 

Thankfully she was fine, but I still don’t know why she thought a store would have a humidifier, nonetheless reach to grab the source of the steam! Ever since I’ve been super anxious when people even get close to it when it’s on.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d74qp2,“I’ll probably beep on the way out”,"This woman came into my clothing store with a bag of clothes she wanted to return. All had tags. All were duplicates and had sensor damage. Sizes ranged from XS to XL, but she claimed her daughter bought it all and none of it fit. We aren’t allowed to turn away any returns no matter what. 

Since she didn’t have a receipt I had to put it on a gift card. (They don’t care because then they use the gift card, return everything and get the money) She got back more than $300. 

She also mentioned that she usually beeps on her way in and out of stores because of her bag. She told me she was surprised she didn’t beep on the way in, but that she’ll probably beep on the way out. I laughed my ass off as soon as she walked away because it was hilarious to me and everyone else around that she would say such a thing. Basically telling me she was going to steal. 

We also aren’t supposed to say or do anything. You have to laugh or else you’ll just get frustrated. 

She left. Didn’t beep. Came back in and bought a $10.00 t-shirt after trying on a mountain of clothes and walking around the store for almost an hour. She beeped on the way out. No surprise there. 

Another store told us she seems to be hiding things not only in her bag, but somehow under her very long skirt that she was in fact wearing when she came in. 

She called not even an hour later saying she lost her gift card and wanted to know if she could come in again so we could issue her a new one. My manager knew exactly what was going on and even though she could get in trouble for it, she gave the woman our customer service number  and told her to talk to them. The woman got noticeably angry and said it was ridiculous. 

We were told afterwards customer service would cancel the old gift card before issuing her a new one which was good news. 

She came in later that week to try things on, but not buy anything. She beeped on the way out so our store manager followed her outside to see her license plate because apparently, that’s how our other stores have been doing it. “Anonymously” call the police and basically say we are workers but not to tell corporate we called. The only problem was that she had a driver and he sped out of there before sm even got outside.",TalesFromRetail

Me: 'Thank you for calling Big Box Hardware. How may I help you?'

SG (Very angry) : 'I bought some birdseed from you about a week ago.  I planted it, but no birds grew.  What did I do wrong?'

ME: ...

At first I was waiting for her to laugh and hang up.  This has to be a crank call.  No one could be that dumb.

SG: (Continues, sounding extremely annoyed.) 'Do I need to water them more?  What else do I need to do?'

ME: 'OK... You do know that you cannot grow birds from birdseed, right?' (Still waiting for her to start laughing.)

SG:  (Huffs loudly) 'Well, someone should have told me that before I bought it!' 

She was completely serious.

The rest of the conversation was her trying to find out how to return the remaining birdseed.  Without a receipt, of course.

I will be very interested to see if she comes in this weekend.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d6zbqa,A slightly wholesome story about a formerly odd customer,"For background, I'm a section head in a store that sells everything from home goods to clothing to groceries. I've worked in my store for a dozen years.

About a year ago we had a woman who would come into our store and she was a bit off. She always wore the same clothes. She would come in daily. She would make grandiose claims that she worked for the store, she was in our loss prevention, she was a police officer, she was a doctor, she was a lawyer, she was in the government, etc. Creating problems but not significant enough she was a major issue.

We took to referring to her as ""crazy Asian lady"" when discussing our interactions.

Nobody had seen her for a long time and the last month or so she's been showing up again. She's always in different clothes now. She doesn't make grandiose claims of her employment. She's.... Pretty normal.

I'm glad she got the help she needed and is doing better.

It’s not a toy.” I smiled and the kid stopped playing with it. His mother, who was at the pharmacy with a baby, snapped her head around to look at me and I will never forget what she said to me. “You can’t talk to him without my permission!” I looked at her a little shocked, said sorry, and left. I was fuming. She knew her son shouldn’t have been playing with it and I knew he shouldn’t have been playing with it. He could either hurt himself or break the machine. But what could I do?

t3_d66a5v,Cop tries breaking Georgia law in liquor store,"So, I work at a small liquor store in Georgia. One day an older man (looks about in his 50s) along with a young girl that might be 18 at oldest walk into the store. The guy brings 2 bottles of RTD drinks up to the counter and the girl brings a 6 pack of wine coolers. Obviously since Georgia law requires anyone who physically brings alcohol up to the counter with the intent of it being purchased in any fashion, I have to check her ID. So, I ask for the ID.

Guy: No, she's not buying it.

Me: Well she brought it to the register so, by law I have to see her ID and confirm she's 21.

Guy: This is my daughter and the beer is for my wife.

The guy then pulls out a police badge and places it on the counter. I pause in disbelief. I think ""Is this guy really trying to do this?"" So, we then go back and fourth about how the beer cannot be purchased and he even tries the old ""what if she goes wait in the car or if she puts the beer back and I bring it to the register""

Me: It's like this: You being an officer of the law should know what the laws are. The fact you're putting me in this position is pretty inconsiderate. And, I cannot in any way sell you this 6 pack.

Well, eventually he concedes. It was never really a major argument. Wish I could say some more crazy stuff happened, but no. There is this one little bit of info though: I later found out the officer was of top rank of a neighboring city. Not gonna get into any specifics other than that. But I mean, maybe he was getting it for his wife like he said, but I still just can't sell it to him. For all I know it could have been a sting (that's a thing...they will do that to liquor stores).

He was a real cop. I told my boss what happened thinking we can have a good laugh about it. She knew who I was talking about because she saw him moments before this happened. Also, he lives down the street from her.

Cashier- c

I go up and talk to the cashier as the guy is going back to grab another mower. 
I look over the old one and find nothing wrong with it. 

C- he said the handle is upside down and that it won’t start and the motor locked up. 

Me- what? 

The customer then comes back and says they are all like that. 

They are brand new and not all of them are locked up. 

He cusses us out as he gets his refund and leaves. 
 
I look over the mowers he was talking about and realize this guy is a giant idiot. The handles is upside down on all the mowers because they fold to make room for packaging and shipping. 

The motor wasn’t locked up it says in the instructions that the handle needs to be pulled out because they go so far down they hit the blades. They do this to make the boxes smaller so they can ship and store them more efficiently.

t3_d661q9,Putting their foot in their mouth.,"TLDR AT BOTTOM

This happened a few years ago when I had just started my personal Hell that is a career in retail, but I remember it as if it was yesterday.

I worked at a local grocery store next to a housing estate, so we would get pretty regular customers. Over the course of a few weeks, this one customer sporadically came in to do some shopping. Pretty normal so far right?

The guy had no arms.

He would use one arm stump to carry the basket and when getting something from the shelves, he would use his feet as if they were his hands.

Know what else he done with his feet? Pay for his goods at the checkout. He had the bottoms of his jeans turned up to use as pockets and would rummage for coins or notes and pass them over between his toes.

Absolutey disgusting yet kind of fascinating at the same time.

Anyway...he was in doing his thing one day and I was on the checkout, mentally preparing myself for when he was done. My supervisor was with me and we were just chatting. She sees him trying to get a bag of sweets off the shelves, turns to him and asks....

...""Do you need a hand?""

I don't know what he said in reply mainly because
I was too busy chewing my lip to stop myself bursting out laughing at the till. 

They had their exchange and he went back to shopping and I turned to my supervisor and asked if she had realised what she just said. 

She was mortified and said the words just came out before she even realised. 

I often wonder whatever happened to that guy.

t3_d631p1,My First Pharmacy Experience,"This is a tale about a customer who was so off her knockers that a fight nearly ensued. Now I can't give away too much information (HIPAA) but what I can tell you is that this took place the first day I worked in the pharmacy. I do need to give some background first.

When I started working in this store, I started out as just a measly cashier. As the months went by, I started getting small position changes. Some days I'd be working more in the photo department, and other days I'd be working on projects that my boss would give me instead of cashiering the whole day. After about a year of working at this store, I was offered a position to where I'd not only help in the front of the store, but I'd be helping in the pharmacy too. I was helping fill and dispense prescriptions. I was basically a non-licensed pharmacy tech with entry level skills. There was a raise involved so I took the position. In the weeks following that promotion, I was being trained on the various work stations in the pharmacy.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally I'd gotten a portion of one of my shifts working in the pharmacy with minimal help for the first time. I felt so anxious and exhilarated at the same time. My first customer was an elderly lady who was simply picking up a prescription. At first she seemed so harmless and docile. I asked for her last name and everything. She was so compliant. As I was looking at her prescription information, I was terrified because the script had a TPR (Third Party Rejection). Looking at the notes, for whatever reason, her insurance company wasn't covering her prescription and this was for a certain controlled substance. I relayed this to the customer as delicate as I could and she absolutely blew up.

C = Customer

M = Myself

P = Pharmacist

O = Officer

C: WHAT DO YOU MEAN MY INSURANCE STOPPED COVERING THIS? I'VE TAKEN THIS FOR SEVEN YEARS! YOU MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG! LET ME TALK TO THE PHARMACIST!

M: Okay I'm sorry! I'll let you speak to her!

I called the pharmacist over and explained the situation. She looked up the script on her own computer and had seen an error code next to the rejection that only she knew (I think I was supposed to know what it meant too but I was clueless).

P: Okay so it looks like you need to set up an appointment with your doctor. Then your doctor will authorize another prescription for you and we can fill it.

C: I'M MOVING OUT OF THE COUNTRY SOON AND I CAN'T GO TO THE DOCTOR! THIS IS ABSOLUTE BULLS\*\*T! CAN'T YOU JUST GIVE ME A PERMANENT VACATION OVERRIDE OR SOMETHING?

P: No ma'am we can't. It's against policy for us to do that. Are you going on vacation or are you actually moving?

C: I'M MOVING!

P: So unfortunately since you're moving, there isn't anything we can do on our end. I'm sorry.

C: YOU MOTHERF\*\*\*ER! I WANT MY SCRIPT NOW!

She started picking up the scan gun at the pharmacy window register and threw it back at the pharmacist. I immediately went into a ""fight or flight"" response and backed up as far as I was able to.

P: Ma'am we have to ask you to leave the store now or we will call the police.

C: I AM NOT LEAVING! GIVE ME MY MEDICINE!

I was backed up against the wall, terrified of what this lady could have done. She was screaming threat after threat at myself and the pharmacist. Other customers were watching the incident from afar and didn't come any closer. They had a right to be scared. The pharmacist gave me a signal to call the store manager from a different phone. I do so from a phone that's up against the drive thru window. The manager was surprised but gave me the go ahead to call the police. After describing the threat to dispatch, they offered to send two officers to the store. They do so very quickly. It took them about five minutes. In that five minutes, she nearly got on the counter and tried to lunge at the pharmacist. Like holy crap this elderly woman was super limber and agile for her appearance and age. I freaked out and ran to the back of the pharmacy where the break room door was. I was afraid she'd gotten into the pharmacy and started wrecking the snot out of everything. I immediately heard ""GET ON THE GROUND WITH YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD"" from an unfamiliar voice. It was the voice of an officer. They were subduing and arresting that lady. She never made it over the counter but instead cracked one of her hips trying to get on it.

O: Sir you can come out from back there. the area is safe.

I walk out and the second officer is escorting the lady out of the store. I answer some questions from the officer and they leave the store about twenty minutes later. I was absolutely traumatized. I'd never experienced anything like that in the four years I'd worked retail. The store manager asked me if I was okay to continue working or if I wanted to go home for the day. I asked to keep working. I was extremely wary and on edge for the rest of my shift.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that that's out of the way, let me give some backstory. I've been thoroughly invested in this subreddit and didn't think I would ever have a story to share, but now I do! I recently started a part-time job at a large chain retail store, mainly sells clothes but dabbles in electronics and toys. Anyway, our store is in a pretty well off socio-economic area so we tend not to get *too* many thefts. On to the story!

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday a lady came in with her kid (maybe 8 or 9?) And the kid led her straight to the toy section were she promptly  began a loud conversation with somebody over her phone. (I'm working the register but have a clear view to pretty much the entire store) While this is happening the kid behaves like a kid and begins pulling all sorts of toys off the shelf to show his mother, who ignores everything and continues chatting away. I quickly lose interest and help out some customers. Soon afterwards I see them walking towards the exit again, the mother is still on her phone, but I notice the kid has some sort of Pokemon TCG pack in his hands (I used to collect the cards but don't anymore, I didn't realize they even still made them) I know they haven't paid for it and as they're about to walk out of the store I run over and try to tell the Mom about the kid still having the pack. Of course it takes me a couple of attempts to actually get her to listen and stop talking on her phone. Finally she tells whoever she's talking to that she would have to hang up because ""Some employee is harassing me"" Fun times ensue:

**Me:** (Hilarious joke about who this could be)

**IM:** Ignorant Mother

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** Excuse me miss your child has a Pokemon card pack he hasn't payed for

**IM:** *Looks at me like I'm some sort of alien life form* A what now?

**Me:** It's a toy from this store, you haven't paid for it yet

**IM:** Are you saying my kid is stealing something?

**Me:** *Dies Internally* Not at all miss I just think you may have forgotten to pay is all

**IM:** I would never forget to pay for something *Begins walking away*

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I probably could have (and should have) gone after them but I suffer from pretty bad social anxiety (I know, retail job + anxiety = Bad) But I just tell my manager about it and offer to pay the price of the pack ($6 I think it was) But my manager says that it was fine (he's nice and understands my anxiety) and tells me if I see her again to come get him.

&amp;#x200B;

Next day rolls around (Today at the time of posting this) and I see her come back into the store with her kid. I go and grab the manager like I was told to and as I come back with him overhear this conversation:

**IM:** Ignorant Mother

**C2:** Cashier 2

&amp;#x200B;

**IM:** Excuse me my son bought (stole) these Pokemon cards yesterday and my son says he didn't get the cards he wanted so I would like a refund

**C2 (Who has an understanding of how Pokemon booster packs work apparently):** Unfortunately Pokemon packs aren't guaranteed to get you the cards you want, they're all randomized.

**IM:** *Alien look again* What?

***Manager (M) steps in***

**M:** Excuse me miss I'm going to have to ask you to leave this store. My employee here (Me) told me about you stealing that pack

**IM:** *Pikachu (haha) surprised face* I did not steal anything!

**M:** Unfortunately miss we have surveillance feeds of the entire incident, so I'm going to have to ask you once again to leave or the police will be called

*IM just runs out of the store, leaving the cards on the cashier bench*

me= is me

rdc= rude customer

matm= manager at the moment

Starts out me on the computer that we have doing the dumb and unhelpful training that we have to complete when rdc comes in and starts looking at the phones I go up tell him about our phones and am cut off while he explains what he wants a cheap phone for at&amp;t for his mother. So I tell him what we have in stock and am cutoff again by rdc saying it has to be Samsung so I tell him about the j series and chooses the only one we have so I go get it to show him and after I return ask him if he wants payments or buy it straight out (earlier he said he didn't want payments but I still asked out of habit). He replies in a rude attitude saying ""I told you no payments"" alright the phone will be 250 he looks at me and says the to expensive 3 years ago I bought a phone for my father for 40 dollars which I respond we don't have an Samsung phones that cheap (we have prepaid but there is a couple month span before you can switch the phones over to another carrier). He points at the prepaids and says what are these while I try to explain the process he would have to do to get that switched to his plan and he cuts me off ""you are not helpful at all how do you even work here where is your manger"" and gets mad that I don't have a manger at the store and storms off while grunting ""ya ill find a manger"" . So I figure it happens and wait as expected a matm comes up and calls me to the front  luckily she is laid back so I have to deal with the manger for about 10 min trying to give my side of the story, explain what happened and tell the matm that he constantly cut me off not letting me explain the manger relaxes I ask where the customer is only to hear that he stormed out already I hope that's the last time I hear from him because dealing with him for 30 min close to end of my shift was wearing out that last of my patience for customers.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d5eqyh,Woman shakes the bottom of ladder I'm standing on.,"I work at a large retail chain, where most of our stock that has been unboxed and unwrapped that is ready to go on the floor gets placed into overhead bins above the racks and inside the walls, usually covered and disguised by posters. This is so when stock runs low, we can very quickly replenish it.

I hate heights, but as a result, a huge part of my job is climbing up ladders to replenish stock. Last week we were out of stock of (item), and it just happened to be on the highest shelf of the excess stock, so I had to use the tallest ladder, which is about 2m (?), or 6.5 foot. Basically, the height of an impressively tall man from lowest to highest usable step. Again, I really do not like heights. I understand to a lot of people, this may not seem very high, but I am always extremely stressed doing this, and my biggest fear has *always* been, since I started this position, some dumb karen coming over and knocking me over.

Last week, my head inside the shelf, standing on top of the ladder, I feel someone at the bottom pushing and pulling. I instantly pull my head out of the shelf, clutching the item, and grasp onto the handle at the top of the ladder. I can literally hear my heart beating inside my head. I look down, gasping for air, and its some dumb youngish woman, about 23-24, smiling up at me, completely oblivious to how fucked up of a thing that is to do to someone.

""hehe! just checking it's sturdy! nice work!""

I was really shocked bc to see someone around my age being such a karen threw me off, but it was the fact she was so oblivious to why shaking a 2m ladder someone was standing on *wasn't ok*. In my nightmare situation it was always a Karen at the bottom, going ""yoo hoo!!! what do I need to do to get some assistance in here!!!!"" or something along those lines. After she stopped shaking, she walked away and I (slowly) climbed down.

I turned my back to quickly replenish the stock I'd pulled (it only takes ten seconds and I'd already gone to all that trouble) and when I went to walk around to find my manager I couldn't find one, nor could I see the woman. I told a coworker I needed a bathroom break but I really just needed to calm down, and when I came back the woman had definitely left the store, and I kinda just let it slide I guess. I don't really have a super comfortable relationship w supervisors or managers at my place, so I figured if I see her again I'll have a polite but firm conversation, but I probably won't. Sometimes I just don't understand what's wrong with people.

EDIT: I think a lot of you are really right I should've had a spotter. I think it's just one of those things where everyone in my workplace is so chill with it and treats it like it's so normal I never even really thought about it enough. I don't live in the US so I can't contact OSHA. I think the course of action I'm most comfortable with is just not replenishing overhead unless someone is in the aisle with me, and if it get's brought up I'll do as you said about refusing a task if it's dangerous. I feel silly now because I feel like in my workplace they wouldn't even bring it up, let alone notice and I shouldn't have been putting myself at risk this whole time. Also as far as retail goes, I actually quite like this job, and otherwise it really suits me. It sucks in situations like this when no manager is around but on the other hand I can kinda just mess around for a lot of my shift and talk to my work buddy.

Also, I did want to address something I see a lot of in this sub, which is ""I would've done this, I could've done this"". On one hand, I totally understand, I definitely read stories on here and think ""I would've punched that customer"", or ""oh yeah I would've given them an ear full!"", and get all riled up. But sometimes in these situations, and I think we can all empathize, when someone starts yelling at you out of the blue, or a customer says something so insulting and abusive really unexpectedly, or shakes a ladder you're standing on and you've been working for 6 hours already so the lights are on but no ones home, it can take you a minute to even adjust to what actually just happened. It honestly wasn't even until I got into the bathroom until I actually understood what had even happened. My fight or flight started going and I think my biggest thing was just to get down from the ladder safely, and find a manager to report it (who turned out to be on a smoke break of all things).",TalesFromRetail
t3_d5qzdw,The tale of the fraudulent returner,"TLDR at the bottom. 

A bit of context.  I work at a craft store, corporate cut our LP position, we use customer service to deter shop lifters. When doing a return without a receipt you get the lowest sale price and we need a form of ID.

Our cast: M=manager, FR=fraudulent returner, CO=coworker, and ME.

 Our story begins about a month ago give or take a week. I get called up to the registers fire back yo by my coworker. As we get the line down a girl(FR) comes to my register. FR has about 6 products she is returning without a receipt. I'm going through the transaction normally, no red flags yet. 

About the same time my CO needs some change and calls up M. As M was getting the change M notices a certain product in the return. She strikes up a conversation with FR.

M: so you didn't need all of this?

FR: no I was working on a project last month and this is what was left over. 

M: oh, always buy more so you return what you don't need. *picks up a certain product* Interesting we just stocked this a 2 days ago. You said you got all of this here?

FR: no I got this at a different location, like 2 weeks ago.

M: interesting this product just got shipped to the stores, no store was supposed to put them it until a specific date. Which store?

FR: I don't remember which store. 

M: ok.

I finish processing the return and send her on her merry way.  FR leaves and M tells both CO and ME to keep an eye for her. This is where most stories end and you wouldn't figure out the return is stolen product returned. The story doesn't end here, it continues today. Same exact cast, FR really didn't think. 

So today I'm covering my CO's break. FR is back and has another return. I of course recognize her. I say the normal spiel and then walkie M and tell M I need a managers approval for a return. Luckily M is a couple of aisles away and gets to the register almost immediately. M just takes over on a different register. 

M: hi I hear your returning all of this?

FR: yeah my grandma doesn't need any of it.

M: do you have the receipt?

FR: no, my grandma couldn't find it.

M: did she buy it all in this store?

FR: yes that's what she told me.

M: all on the same transaction?

FR: yup that's what grandma said. 

M: ok do you want to give me a moment to see if I can find the receipt? You would get the exact amount you paid for instead of the lowest sale price. 

FR: sure that would be awesome.

M: did your grandma happen to say when she bought all of this?

FR: uh yeah a couple of weeks ago.

M: ok I'll be right back.

Exit stage left M.

FR: I'll stand to the side so you can help the others. 

FR is grinning ear to ear like she just won the lottery. 

I take the next customer and tne starts building. I was going to call for back up, however my CO pages over the walkie she's back from break. Sweet!! 

CO gets back and takes the next customer. While both of us are finishing up with our customers, M comes back. 

M: I couldn't find any receipt are you sure it was at this store?

FR: it could have been the store closer to her house. 

M: ok then it'll have to be the lowest sale price. Is that ok?

FR: yeah that's fine. 

M processes the return, tells CO to finish it up and hands CO a return card. 

CO tries to process the return card and one small problem it's already been issued. CO calls M back. We ran out of return cards. M voids the transaction. And apologizes to FR. FR exits scene. 

M sends a mass text to every location in our district and one to the DM to inform the other locations not in our district. CO asked if that was the FR we were on the look out for because she looked just like her. 
We all agree we won't be seeing FR anytime soon. 

TLDR: a customer who is suspected of returning stolen product, gets away the first time, comes back to the same store in which the same exact staff just happened to be scheduled. Because of confidence FR doesn't get away with it and all other locations are warned.

Edit: fire back yo is meant to be paged by.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d5ahuh,"It doesn't run on magic and unicorn farts, you muppet!","I just got to top off my Monday by arguing with an irate customer. Fun. My store installs television service. Most of our products are wired, but we have one product that is wireless. The wireless aspect is that it doesn't connect to a coaxial cable in the wall, the signal to the unit is sent wirelessly, and you are free to move the tv and unit anywhere within the home.

Enter customer who was up in arms because he was promised wireless and his box has wires. I checked his account and confirmed he had a wireless unit. He started yelling and telling me I am wrong. I showed him the unit on the sales floor when I get hit with a gem.

Irate customer points at the unit in triumph ""SEE??!? THIS so called wireless box has wires!!!!"" Yup. It has a power cord and an HDMI cord to connect to the television.

t3_d5audl,The times our entire store lost power because of the builder's carelessness,"The title can look pretty much self-explanatory, but the ending is not what you might think it is. It's funny, though! TL;DR at the bottom, cause I have a feeling this will be long.

So I worked at a big chain retail company for some time (gotta pay tuition, you know!). The entire chain is currently upgrading both the interior and exterior of - I think - all the stores in the world, and since my specific store is in a very small county, we started much later than the other stores (the work was already started when I began working there, though). 

For whatever reason, the store manager could not seem to find good builders, and the weeks before I started working there had been awful for the store. Why? Cause the workers apparently weren't educated enough to manage to keep the power on for more than 30 minutes continuously. Mind you, we of course have fully electronical payment systems, and not even the registers could be opened without electricity. Every time the power got cut, we had to call the electricity company, who took at least 10 minutes to come, and additional time to fix the problem. Plus, the register systems themselves took about 15-20 minutes to start up everytime. This meant a great loss in funds, since we lost SO many customers over the course of many, many weeks. 

When I got there, the power had not been fixed whatsoever, so it still cut out regularly, and my poor manager (who is SO nice) and/or colleagues had to call the electricity company many times during each work day, and they got increasingly frustrated with how the builders handled things. They were slobs with pretty much everything they did, not just the electricity. It's the only times I've ever seen my manager angry! They bothered the customers by making extremely loud noises (and yes, of course there will be noise when a store is rebuilding, but they did NOTHING to lower the volumes, which they apparently easily could've done), their equipment sent out fumes that made people dizzy, they drilled holes in the ceiling that cracked it up so much that debris started falling down (thankfully not on customers) etc, etc. So when a certain - very, VERY angry - customer came to me with a complaint, I was not surprised.

I was standing alone at the register, and my only other colleague that worked that shift was in the back, where the loading dock was. In comes this very tall guy (mind you, I'm also very tall, but this dude was TOWERING over me), his face was almost purple with anger, and he comes up to me. He starts telling the story, of how we - the employees - apparently hadn't checked if the nails had been completely hammered down in the wood, in a hand made speed bump outside the store, that was right nearby the loading dock. In fact, he wondered if they'd even TRIED to hammer them down. He had driven over them with his MANY-WHEELED CARGO TRUCK, and said that if we had punctured his wheels, he would make us pay.

After he had finished yelling, I - very carefully, cause I actually thought he was going to hit me - said that it was not us that had a hand in those things, but rather the builders, who did nothing right. But they had gone for the day. He did not calm down, and I was very scared, so I told him to come with me to the back, where my (male) colleague was, so I'd have a witness if he actually did something. We went to him, and I told him what happened. He said the same thing as me, that the builders were responsible. The guy went away and said something along the lines of ""if I find a puncture, I will have you pay for it!"".

I got back out to the register, and after about an hour, the power cuts off again. The electricity company is called, and they come and try to sort things out. They took an unusually long time to fix it, but I didn't think too much of it since there were no customers there at the time. The power comes back after about 40 minutes, and I start everything up again. Then my colleague comes out from the back, and asks me ""hey, did you hear what happened?!""

Usually, what makes us lose power is when too many machines are connected to the power supply, and sometimes the builders run over cables with their portable elevator, so they pop out of the wall. And since the workers had gone for the day and couldn't have moved anything, I figured that their equipment (still running) had blown a fuse like it usually did, or maybe it had burned out the entire electrical cabinet they had in the room they worked in, cause that would've taken some time to fix. But oh boy, was I wrong!

My colleague goes on to tell me that the angry trucker was the culprit! The dude had snuck up to the side of our store building, AND PULLED OUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE HUNDREDS OF POWER CABLES THAT WERE CONNECTED TO THE FUSE BOXES! I did not believe my ears! The electrician was SO fast to fix it, too, he deserves some kind of award (also, if I remember correctly, it was actually a Saturday, so he wasn't even supposed to come in to work AT ALL!).

I talked to my manager about it all the next day, and she basically said that the trucker was not very smart, cause if his wheels WERE damaged now, he could not win a claim for the money, because he committed a crime! I didn't hear what happened after this, but I think it never got cleared up.

TL;DR The builders MAY have punctured a man's truck wheels, so he punished the completely innocent store/employees by yanking out all hundreds of power cables from the fuse boxes outside the building, so we lost all power for a while.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d53xbq,Rude dude wants pants,"Hey all, on mobile so please forgive the formatting. For context, I’m a 24 year old American female living in a Nordic country. I’ve lived here for two years now, and have a pretty decent command of the native language. I can hold small conversation and can understand very well—and even when I don’t, the gist of things is usually apparent. However, being human, I often come into contact with words I don’t know, or have trouble with the phonetics. In any case, I still try my best. 

I’m currently working at a clothing store in one of the local malls. It was my day off, but I got called in because of low staff. It’s Monday, so business is extremely slow as most people are at work or school in the area. 

About an hour into my shift, in walks a burly older dude who starts browsing the men’s section. Now, our store is marketed as “youth street style,” but we have had older customers find some things they like, so I didn’t think much of it. I see him kind of wandering aimlessly, so in the native tongue I greet him and ask if he needs any help. He says he is looking for “____” pants. I ask him to repeat himself because I thought I was misunderstanding. He does. Then I say (in English this time) “Umm sorry would you mind describing these pants in English?” This dude looks at me so disappointingly, and just repeats the word, again, in the native tongue.

Okay, we do get a lot of older people that would rather speak to someone who is fluent, so I walk over to my coworker and ask her. The dude is standing right next to me. I repeat what he said as best as I can, and not even my coworker knows what he means. He never tries to step in and clarify and just keeps his focus on me. 

So, naturally, I turn to him and say “I’m sorry, but I don’t think we do...” He sighs and gives me a hard look of frustration, and in a very condescending tone asks me (in English from here on), “You don’t know what you’re selling?” Politely, I reply, “yes, I do, but it would help me if you could describe it in English, if you don’t mind.” He then hyperactively waves his hands at me, and tells me to follow him, so I do, and he brings me to a table where he POINTS out the pants he’s looking for (uhhh why didn’t he show me to begin with if he knew where they were??). I ask him what size he is usually, and he tells me he’s “105 in the waist.” I pull out the biggest size we carry in those pants, and ask him if he wants to try them. He holds them up and says they’re too small.  Again, he says, “I NEED 105 IN THE WAIST!!!”I proceed to tell him we don’t know the exact measurements of pants, we just have the sizes on the tag to go by. He doesn’t want to listen, waves his hands at me, and tells me never mind. Cool.

Maybe it’s just the fact that it’s a Monday, but almost every customer I have encountered since has been condescending or dismissive in some way EVEN when I’m speaking the native language. How fun! Maybe the universe didn’t want my ass to work today, but I’ll still kill them with my customer service smile :)))",TalesFromRetail
t3_d4vysw,Rude customer actually apologizes,"When I was working at a thrift store, we would get all sorts of customers.  Most are nice folks and some not so much.  I was busy ringing people up and helping people with merchandise they wanted to look at.  I then look up from my work at the cash wrap and spot a guy (we'll call ""Todd"") carrying a crockpot in his arms.  Bear in mind that Todd is a regular.

&amp;#x200B;

For some weird reason, I call Todd over and ask if he paid for it.  He goes off, saying things like ""you know me, I wouldn't steal"" and ""I shop here all the time; do you think I would steal?"" I was kinda shocked that Todd would act or behave this way toward me.  I apologize and my co-worker told me that I was just doing my job (other co-worker vouched for Todd as he had rung him up).  I excuse myself and went to the bathroom to cry as I just felt horrible for pissing him off and for being yelled at for doing my job.  

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a few days later, I was at the cash wrap and Todd approaches me and, with true conviction in his eyes, tells me that he wanted to apologize for his behavior and that he behaved inappropriately.  To paraphrase him, he tells me that he's not a rude person in real life.  I accepted his apology and told him that my asking him was just an impulse.  Later that day, I'm in the break room for a swig of water and my supervisor (who's on his lunch break) asks me if Todd apologized.  I said yes and then the supervisor proceeded to tell me that he had shown up the day before, thinking I was working (I was off) to say he was sorry.

t3_d4wbk3,"Why can't customers say ""excuse me""?","I work in the meat department at my store, we cut our beef steaks on site (rump, porterhouse etc.) and there's a pretty open view of the shop floor where this happens (there's a refrigerated case between us and the customer, a bit below shoulder height), we can see out and look at the department and customers can see us and talk to us if they need too. 

So, I'm here wrapping steaks today, not really paying much attention to a customer on the other side, I knew he was there though. He's kinda just standing there, so I assume he's looking at the steaks, again, not really paying attention and haven't really looked up to see him staring at me. 
Had been a solid minute of him staring at me and he decides, instead of saying ""excuse me"" to clear his throat, which still didn't get my attention until I look up like 20 seconds later:

&gt;Me: Hey, what's up?

&gt;Friend: Felyne! Thank god it's you. Do you have any USB-C chargers? The one that came with my phone is barely working and my phone is almost dead.

t3_d4rxx4,The €1 dilemma,"So. For the past few months I've been working as a cashier in a supermarket. Now, as most of you know, there can be some really... annoying customers. Here's my fair share of the stories, even if it's not the most horrible thing to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

So, this took place several weeks ago. I was happily going on with my afternoon shift. Then these elderly couple come in and start to put their products on the counter and I scan them, as I'm supposed to. They were really nice at the start and there were was really nothing to criticize them on... Until the moment of paying comes. NOTE: I did make an accident during the events, but the way they handled it wasn't the best.

  
Before I continue, here's a little background: While in most stores, you can pay a little bit extra with your card, and then the cashier hands you the extra money in cash. (So you kind of withdraw the money from your bank account) However, our store does not accept this method, since we literally have an ATM in the corner.

&amp;#x200B;

So... EC = Elderly Couple. ME = Me.

EC: ""Can we do a small withdrawal at your cash register?""  
ME: ""I'm sorry ma'am, but we don't do that here. There is an ATM over there where you can withdraw some money."" (I pointed them in the direction and generally stayed nice to them.)  
EC: ""We know, but you can only withdraw €20 or more. And we only need €1.""  


Since they were super nice up until this moment, I decided to be a good guy and accept their request. However, since this was something I had never done before AND because it's something out of the ordinary (and because I can't cope with sudden changes that well), I got a little confused and instead, accidently charged €1 too much. I didn't realize it at first and neither did they, so I went on with the next customer. This is where stuff goes down.

&amp;#x200B;

As I was busy with the next customer, they came back to me.

EC: ""I'm sorry, but you have charged €1 too much.""  
ME: ""Oh, I did? I apologize. Once I am done with this customer, I can help you further, okay?""

They shrugged it off at first. (NOTE: There was quite a line building up) But within in a minute they became impatient and started to get mad at me

EC: ""WE DEMAND THAT €1 BACK!""

At this point, I was still convinced that I hadn't screwed up, so I calmly explained my actions and how they would be correctly. They kept demanding the €1 (which was in the right of them), so I kindly gave them the €1 back, and they left kind of fed up. (The discussion kinda went back and forth for a while, as I tried to stay calm, not get a panic attack and not to cry, as they kept being mad and yelling at me)

&amp;#x200B;

The next customer was really nice and gave me an extra €1 with his products, however, which was really nice.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, I did make the mistake. But is it that bad? We cashiers are human and we make mistakes. I was and always am in the position to help people. However, whenever they get mad at me, I am less likely to cooperate, as a way of karma. Had they stayed calm and waited patiently, so they could calmly explain what I did wrong, I would probably realize my mistake sooner and be more willing to help them.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have discovered a mistake the cashier has made, please point it out nicely and respect that they have more customers to help.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d4jkcr,Stop smoking in people's cars,"First time poster looooong time lurker Mobile English blah blah blah


Anyways some backstory,  I've been touring with my band for the last 6 month and just got back about a month ago. So I was thinking that I need a job to pass the time. I ended up getting a job at a car wash. Im 20 years old and was born with a heart condition (this will be important later) This happened a Wednesday (also important) on to the story. TL:DR at the bottom.

Cast:

Op- Me

CS- Cool Supervisor (Dave)

CL-Crazy Lady (Karen)

FM- Friend Minor (Noel)

CM- Camaro Lady (Margaret)

So about a month into this job  I've gotten pretty comfortable working I know just about everyone there and I quickly realise that Senior Day (Wednesday) is the worst day of the week. The way my  shift goes is open till the minors come, we have a lot. Well one of these minors (FM) came early and I happen to be friends with him so Dave put me and him on the same team. My job was to clean the inside of the car his was to clean side 2, the Noel was stuck on a lady with a Camaro (Margaret) so I just move on to the next car. I finish doing every thing I needed to so I gather my things to get out and Karen ask for my supervisor (Dave), this super common since people are really picky about their cars. I go get him and I have to stay just incase Karen needs me to wipe/clean anything off. Karen then ""politely"" accuses Noel of smoking in her car, the legal smoking age where I live is 18 and he had just turned 17 in June and was still in HS. Dave tried to explain this but she was adamant. Something I should add is that he was still with Margaret. Karen then asked who was inside the car I confess it was me (wrong thing to do) Karenthen switches the blame to me and accuses me of smoking in her car saying things like ""check his pockets hes going to have a vape"" or ""check the cameras youll see"". Im one of three people who don't smoke Dave tried to explain to her that I don't smoke. I then say that I can't smoke cause I have a heart condition thats doesn't let me smoke (not that i want to). Still adament she keeps waiving our explaining and clearly reasoning with here was impossible so she just asked if she could have some frangrance so it doesn't smell like ""smoke"". As she was leaving she said something that I find funny even now ""Just remember people are watching"" we both looked at eachother and laughed internally. We got her a  fragrance and sent her on her way. I ended by taking the only smoke I've ever took but since I dont smoke I just ate a sandwich.

TL:DR- A Karen accuses a minor and someone with a heart condition of smoking in her car.

t3_d46whu,"""Stop calling it by its name!""","I work in the electronics section of my local location of a popular department store. The town is largely populated by old/retired people, so I'm used to explaining technology in a simple-to-understand way. With that out of the way, on to the story.

I'm stocking shelves when I see an older man staring at cables and muttering to himself. I put on a smile, walk over, and do my whole ""hello, welcome to [store], how may I help you"" thing.

Man: ""I'm so sick and tired of needing so many cables to connect my technology. I have an iPad, a phone, and a computer and it's a pain to connect it all.""

Him: ""These are too expensive.""

Me: ""Well, sir, this is the cheapest that these cables usually go for. Now, when you're selecting a cable, make sure it says 'micro-USB' on the box, like thi-""

Me: ""Sir, I understand, but that's what I'm trying to expla-""

Him: ""Clearly you don't understand people,"" I'm a terrible worker, I'm out of touch, etc.

At this point, I realize he's going to refuse any kind of help, so I decide to take our cheapest cable, peel off the tape keeping it shut, and show him the end. He yanks the cable out of my hand as I'm in the middle of saying ""Is this what you're looking  for"" and starts walking towards the exit, and I chase after him, explaining that he needs the box in order to check out. He barks that he doesn't need it, finally grabbing it out of my hand when I restate that he needs a barcode if he intends to pay for it. He barks something about ""teaching me how to work"" as I sigh and go back to stocking boxes.",TalesFromRetail

t3_d495r3,Guy gets stuck in a loop about backpacks,"Hey retail people, this is my first post on the sub. I’m on mobile and not that great of a writer so apologies in advance. This happened about a week ago. It’s a long one...

I’m a manger at an office supplies chain store. I’d say 85% of our customers are easy but oh man that 15%. Right now, we are at the end of back to school season so there’s a lot clearance going on. This tends to incur the wrath of a lot of penny pinchers and more Karens than usual. This story is about one of those people. Sadly I was on the phone with our general manager (we have 4 mangers total for various departments) so I didn’t get to handle this personally but I watched it all happen and got a full recap. 

Our characters today are-
Plaid Lad- PL
Coworker- CO
Manger 1- M1
Manger 2- M2

Right now we have a sale that is 50% off school backpacks. We carry backpacks all year round but during back to school we get an entire new rack and shipment for kids. Think like ages 5-17. These backpacks are OBVIOUS. As in directly up front in the middle of the store obvious. They have a dedicated sign and every one has a sticker marking it as 50% off. All year backpacks are in an aisle closer to the back of the store. These are classified as business cases because they hang out with the briefcases and are insanely expensive and made with “better materials”. Cue this early 30’s gentleman coming in with a plaid shirt and a trilby on.

PL: Hey where would I find backpacks?

CO: (standing directly in front of the rack) We have a few up front here on sale, but there is more back in x aisle. 

PL: Okay thanks. (proceeds to check out the rack and then head back to the aisle)

 This is when I take a phone call from the GM about a scheduling crisis so I head to an inconspicuous spot.
CO has gone to the register to check someone out and M1 takes his place near the doors. This is when I notice PL is back up front holding a backpack from the aisle and is taking pictures on his phone of the signs on the school backpacks. Weird, but okay, after that he heads up to the register. I’m told the interaction went like this (paraphrasing) all while PL is sweating and stuttering:  

PL: So...this is a backpack s-so it’ll be 50% off right?

CO: Unfortunately the sale is only for the school backpacks up front there. You have one that is classified as a business case so it’s not on sale. I’m sorry. 

PL: But it’s a backpack. It should be on sale. The sign says ALL BACKPACKS. 

CO: It’s specifically for all school backpacks, I’m sorry if it’s confusing, but the 50% off ones have stickers on them. 

PL: Thats completely ridiculous. I want to speak to a manager. 

M1 is called over to help, he is generally chill and he doesn’t give in to customers acting a fool. 

M1: What can I do for you?

PL: Your sign says ALL BACKPACKS (it doesn’t) and this is a backpack. (Just for reference he has a messenger bag actually) 

M1: Yeah our 50% off sale is actually for the school backpacks it’s— 

PL: But I’m using this for school. So why does it matter. It should be 50% off. That’s what the sign says. 

M1: I’m sorry but there’s not a lot I can do about it I could maybe see if we have a coupon and I can—

PL: What’s the corporate number? I’m gonna call them about this.

For general ease of use for employees and customers we have business cards printed out with the corporate numbers on them because there’s a few different ones for different things (general, rewards program, etc.) 

M1: (hands him a card) The general number is the customer service line. 

PL: Wow you guys are such a bad store you have cards already made?? (Storms out after asking CO for M1’s name and like all of us, he’s clearly wearing a name tag)

Okay well annoying but situation handled right? Nah. Maybe 2 minutes pass and dude comes back. Heading in the exit door, CO confronts him. 

CO: Was there something else we could do for yo—

PL: Yeah IM PISSED OFF.  (Becoming more animated) This is garbage. It said all packs. 

CO: Well sir it— 

He storms off to M1 who is helping another customer with a computer. PL marches up to him, and M1 radios for me or M2 so he can finish with his customer. I am still on the phone at this point trying to help GM figure out the schedule for next week but M2 just happened to be walking by already. 

He flags him down and the whole bit starts again. 
As they walk past me to the rack of school backpacks I hear PL’s phone camera once again going off all over the place. 

M2: So on this sign here, as you can see, it does say “excludes business cases and x brand” 

PL: I’m using this for SCHOOL. So I should get the discount. It said aLL bAcKPaCkS. 

M2: Yes, and I’m sorry sir but the one that you have- PL: You have to be kidding me. Are you dumb? Come back and show me the difference then! 


They walk back to the aisle and I can only imagine that he just keeps talking in circles. 

I didn’t see the resolution but after I got off the phone CO told me that M2 gave him the 50% off just to get the guy to leave. 

I have mixed feelings on that, usually I’m the type of manager to just get rude/mean customers out of my associates faces but 50% cuts deep for us cause we’re a smaller store compared to other locations in the area. M2 has only been a manager for a month or so, so I could see where he’s coming from but also I know CO and M1 felt a bit betrayed. They spent the time trying to find solutions and telling this rude guy no just for him to get what he wanted anyway by being such a nuisance. 
We all came to the conclusion that at some point he decided he wanted to start a fight about this, between the pictures/being nervous and sweaty at first it just seemed too weird. 

Im curious if any of you would have handled it differently, let me know. 
Thanks for reading, Take care out there everyone!

He came out to be about a 11 (in youth sizes), I always tell the parents what size their kids wear just so they can know. When i told her she began to raise her voice ""no! He does not wear an 11 that's way too big he probably wears an 12 or so. You measured his foot wrong!"" (yes she said he wears a size bigger AFTER saying an 11 was too big).

I went back and got the shoes for all three of her kids. She got all three of her kids matching shoes and had two of them trying them on at once while the youngest was eating some lego brick candy and dropping it on the floor. During that time she was making side comments like ""I have to re-lace the shoes because YOU did it wrong."" Thankfully my manager was helping me as it would've taken forever on my own.

""I need my ID."" he says, staring at my hands. In my hands were my clearly bright -pink- sticky notes. At first I was very confused and said,

""Yes sir, its right there."" and nodded down at his ID. He didn't look down. His eyes clearly darted from my notes to my eyes.

""I see you holding it."" he says.

I finally point as well, right at his ID . The one right in front of him. The one NOT in my hand. The one that is clearly not bright pink.

t3_d3ydms,How a grocery store opens for business: Complex setup methods finally explained,"Have you ever walked into your local grocery store and suddenly noticed how some of the fresh products (such as fruit, vegetables, meat cuts, fish fillets, and bread) are not in the same spot as they were only days before? How some fresh product is even missing or different than when your last grocery trip? Even more shockingly, sometimes the fresh product might not *even be there at all* if you walk into the store 4 seconds after you watch an employee unlock the door that you've been impatiently pacing in-front of despite operational hours being very clearly posted for you! How does this happen, you ask. I am about to reveal the mystery that is 'Opening for Daily Business'.

First, the employees arrive in the morning, most likely 15 minutes prior to opening despite the opening procedures taking a solid 40 minutes. This is because hours need to be cut so the grocery store can maximize profits. Once the employees have signed in, they begin a very rushed set up of their respective departments. Believe it or not, grocery stores strive to ensure all of the products are fresh, clean and properly stored! A lot of the fresh product you see is actually taken down at night, the surfaces and display plates that it is stored on are cleaned and then it is set up again in the morning. Wow! What a concept!

Here is an example of a **real** conversation that **really** occurred, as two different customers enquirer about these very procedures only minutes after the doors have opened. Let's see what happens.

&amp;#x200B;

Customer 1: \*walks up to the seafood service case where only 2 kinds of fish have been set up so far\* Yes, hello. Could I get a piece of that salmon?

Employee: Good morning. Sorry, but I am still setting this case up so not all of the product is properly tagged yet. What you're looking at is actually trout. 

Customer 1:  . . . . this isn't salmon?

Employee: No miss, it's trout.

\*Customer 2 has now walked up and stands next to Customer 1\*

Customer 1: . . . . but the tag above it says it's 'salmon'.

Employee: Right, I understand. However, as I said earlier, I am still setting everything up.

Customer 1: Well I need salmon. \*Customer 2 meanwhile,  is patiently waiting to be served next.\*

Employee: We do have some salmon fillets already pre-packaged, just behind you on the shelves. It's the same salmon I'd be putting in this case. I just haven't gotten to it yet.

Customer 1: Oh. You're tags are wrong then because it says 'salmon' above this trout. \*Walks away to grab the pre-packaged salmon.\*

Customer 2: \*steps up\*  Yes, hello. Could I get a piece of this organic salmon?

Employee: . . . . It is not salmon, miss. Sorry, but I am still setting up so not all of the product is properly tagged yet. What you're looking at is actually trout. 

Customer 2: Oh. So it's not organic salmon?

Employee: . . . . . . .

Please, to avoid causing violent insanity for your grocery store employees, remember that they need to set up a lot of the fresh product you see every day and it takes time.

He was rushed into emergency surgery and they think he had an aneurysm. We still don’t know how he is doing. But I do know that the guy who rushed to call 911 and do CPR saved his life. I can’t imagine what he must have been feeling at the time or how he is feeling now.

t3_d3md4t,Customer accused me of theft today,"I'm a volunteer in Australia. I volunteer in an opportunity shop (op shop) and I am still really upset with this rude, ungrateful customer I had the displeasure of dealing with.

This customer had one of those cases that you put all your cards in so you can flip through them easier (see here: [case](https://www.wish.com/product/5a508939cd0e680915c27bab?from_ad=goog_shopping&amp;_display_country_code=AU&amp;_force_currency_code=AUD&amp;pid=googleadwords_int&amp;c=%7BcampaignId%7D&amp;ad_cid=5a508939cd0e680915c27bab&amp;ad_cc=AU&amp;ad_curr=AUD&amp;ad_price=3.00&amp;fallback_cids=5c0f73133a5a2b6b4a947ad65b0278a227428779865f917b5ba37f7eded3583cad8cae595b1104366b11c815ee46b4425c3982e3329d6c234170e51f5c8096e31aae9a415ba7deb8&amp;campaign_id=6465790720&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIp9izprPN5AIVl6mWCh1z7QW9EAkYByABEgKJNvD_BwE&amp;hide_login_modal=true)). She dropped it where we keep the CDs.

I found it when I was tidying the area and gave it back to her. She thanked me, put it in her handbag and all was good. I went back to my job and she went back to browsing.

Another volunteer ( I shall refer to as Jim for clarity) was serving her at the counter when she was trying to pay for her items but couldn't find her bank card.

She asked me where I found it because her card was missing. I naturally assume it fell out somewhere near the CDs and tried looking for it there. Jim helped me search for it but we couldn't find it anywhere in the area.

She then has the nerve to accuse me of taking her card because I was the one found her case and returned it to her.

She wouldn't let me leave her sight so I had Jim go out the back and get the manager so we could sort out this issue.

Manager comes out, we explain the situation and he offers to help look for the card, and offers to get her name and number so we can contact her if we find it. Customer says that isn't good enough and wants him to search me and turn out my pockets. He rightly denies that request and she demands him to call the police which he also refuses to do.

Customer says she is going to make a formal complaint and leaves to get money out of the bank and cancel her card.

Manager sends me out the back to have a small break and make sure I'm OK.

Apparently she came back and paid for her things but I was still on my break.

Manager had to call the regional manager and explain the whole situation to her so she would have a heads up in case a complaint really did come through.

A bunch of us were making fun of her when she left and saying she probably left it at home or in her car. Manager certainly wasn't going to waste any effort in looking for the card after she accused one of his volunteers of stealing it.

t3_d3qxqc,Dumbass on the Glass,"So, as I've mentioned on a post in r/idontworkherelady, I work at a car dealership. It's a pretty great job, too. Decent pay, a lax work schedule, and the rest of the staff is great.

You see, the way the building is designed, the different offices are in the back of the showroom where we keep the Corvettes, behind glass doors and glass walls. I clean the doors at least once every other day, but apparently, I'm too good at my job because people are always walking into the glass.

In particular, when people are getting ready to leave my office, they somehow completely miss the door and leave a picture-perfect faceprint 2 feet to the left, which I then have to clean up later. What's even worse is that we always leave the office door open, so none of these people were smashing into the door. These people always manage to completely miss the door and hit the glass like a bird against a windowpane. There is literally no excuse for this level of stupidity.

This isn't a once-in-a-blue-moon incident, either. I've counted at least 10 cases of people hitting the glass on that one wall, and I've only been working here for a few months. And before you ask, I was one of those 10 cases, too.

It's actually amazing that the glass hasn't cracked yet. It's become such a common issue that we've considered putting a sticker on the wall, or putting an advertisement display in front of it to steer people away from it. We've tried the latter, and it actually worked for a month, but then we removed the display later.

Just a week and a half ago, a customer was walking out the office (interfacing with the customers isn't really a part of my job yet, so I don't pay much attention to these meetings), and left the most perfect faceprint I have ever seen. We patiently waited for her to get out of earshot, before promptly laughing our asses off at the fact that it FINALLY happened again.

The best part was that my supervisor asked me to go polish the glass afterwards. She is fucking awesome.",TalesFromRetail

I told them im sorry but I dont have controll over the chicken but if you go to the hot bar about 50 feet straight ahead, they have more chicken. They were cool with it and walked there. Then this woman SQUAWKS like, I swear to god, pterdactyl SCREAMING about, and I quote, 'how dare you not have any chicken for my precious family' and 'you should be ashamed of yourself! How will I feed them now?!'. I was so done with her after the squawk. I just walked away letting her bitch because I am self check out host. I DONT have to deal with you lady. Get your head checked. The hot stand near self check outs isnt the only spot. If she hadnt squawked at me I would've gladly helped her get her chicken. I would've went to the hot bar myself.

t3_d3mwlg,"I don’t know how tall your window is, lady","Just a heads up, I’m Norwegian, so I can’t promise the grammar and all the translations are correct, but I’m trying my best.

I work at this store in Norway that sells curtains, towels, pillows stuff like that

But this happened at least an hour or so ago. I was just doing my thing, Manning the cash register. 

Btw, we have two different stores in my town, they’re both pretty small so we only need one person on at the time, so I’m alone until I leave today. 

Anyway, this woman came in asking about pleated curtains. Not sure if that’s what they’re called in English, but I’m just gonna call it that, because that’s what google translate said.
She wanted one that went from her ceiling to her floor, because her window was that tall. (I’m terrible at explaining, I’m sorry)

I told her we didn’t have any in those measurements, and that if she wanted we could order some, but they would have to be custom made and that it was a whole process. I added that I was still pretty new, and didn’t really know much about that. But the lady insisted I check the price. I just said okay, asked her to wait a moment while I called the other store for some help.
After a minute I found the site I needed, and a folder so we could look at the different fabrics she could get the curtains in.

When I presented the folder to her, she just told me she wanted it white, and to give her the cheapest option. 
It’s not cheap to get them custom made. And it’s not the fabric that decides the price, I think. I believe it’s actually the measurements. And if she wanted it from roof to floor, it would be pretty expensive anyway. She wouldn’t like the price even if it was 30% off.

I told her that it was the measurements that mostly decided the price, she nodded and I asked her how wide they needed to be, and how tall. I need exact measurements so I can get it right. If she had ordered them there and then, and I got the measurements wrong, I would have some trouble. And I don’t know if she could return them.

Instead of being helpful, she pretty much expected me to know how tall her wall was. 
Listen lady... I’m 20. I took media classes in school. I failed math, I half asses all classes that involved building. I know nothing about houses other than the fact that we live in them.

I told her again that I needed the exact measurements, but this time, she guessed it was 2 meters. Uh... okay. That helps a lot...
Then she proceeded to tell me she didn’t have time to stand here for much longer, left me her number and walked away. 

I still don’t know how to help her. I don’t know how tall her window is, but what I do know, is that I’m too tired for this.

Her: This is ridiculous. You’re being stupid. This is stupid. I’ll just go elsewhere.

I closed the company over a year ago and when i did i kept the company open at a loss for 2 months just so I could honor any warranty claims that would pop up our warranty is 60 days. I still have the number just so i can keep in touch with old employees or friends i made in the industry I also occasionally get calls from people selling machines and i am a collector. Here is the call i just took. 
M is me.  ap is angry person.

M: hello. 

Ap: how to you expect to make any money if your never at your store?

M: excuse me?

Ap: i have been to your store every day this week trying to get someone to help me fix this game and it’s always locked. 

M: if your looking for ***** we have been closed for around a year. 

Ap: so how the hell do i get this thing fixed then it’s still under warranty do I bring it to your house. 

M: the company has been closed for over a year there are no machines still under warranty. 

Ap: the guy I bought it from said he bought it off you 2 weeks and it’s still under warranty that’s the only reason why I bought it off him. Maybe if you did your job properly you would still be in business. 

M: first i have been closed for over a year i have not sold anything in over a year. Second if your not the one that bought q game from me you would have no warranty anyway. Maybe you should have asked whoever you got it from why they were selling a broken machine when they could get it fixed for free and sell it for more. Third you do know me or why i closed I actually take a lot of pride in my work. I actually closed because one of my frequent customers offered me a full time job making over double what i made running the shop.

Ap after a short pause: im sorry i just want to get this thing fixed i have the guy $600 for it is there anything you can do to help. 

M: what kind of game is it and what is it doing. 

Ap: its a cds(a type of old slot machine) and it lights up but nothing else happens. 

M: then it was never one of mine i never worked on those they aren’t cost effective to fix. The only guy i knew that did died 5 years ago.

So, very commonly at my store people ask for directions because we're right off of a highway. Also commonly my coworkers make me give directions because I'm more willing I guess. 

So this old woman comes in and asks me how to get to another store a whole town away because she's been driving in circles all day. 

So I explain that she needs to get back on the highway and head North, to which she immediately interrupts me to tell me she needs to go South. 

I ask her if shes sure she wants this specific store, and she confirms we're talking about the same store. So, I Google it for her and show her she's mistaken and she starts laughing and telling me I have no idea what I'm talking about.

So she shows me her Map quest directions, and I realize that she put them in backwards from store to her house and thats why she thinks she needs to go South. I point that out and she gets mad saying I'm wasting her time, but for whatever reason won't leave until I help her. 

So I decide reasoning with her is not working so I give her the same driections without using the words north or south, and she keeps interrupting me because map quest didn't mention those street names and highways.

t3_d32irq,Homeless Guy Doesn't Want Me To Talk To Him,"So, I work as a bagger/cart pusher at an organic grocery store. Like any grocery store we have homeless people who will occasionally walk around the parking lot and ask people for change or just hang out in the front. Some of my coworkers and managers will tell them to leave the property or not to harass the customers, but I choose to leave them be mainly because I don't personally care if they ask people for change. Even when a customer asks me to tell them to leave, most of the time I don't do it. 

So there's this homeless man who I'll call Karl who never asks anyone for change, but he'll just hang out in front of the store. We have a sidewalk like path that goes from the front of the store and snakes around to the left side of the store. Karl and another homeless man who I'll call Daniel were sitting on the curb smoking cigarettes. I was looking for carts, and I had to walk behind them to check the left side of the lot. By this time Karl knows I won't bother him.

I walk past them and saw that there were not carts, so I turned to walk back. Daniel chose this time to talk to me.

DANIEL: Hey. (I look over at him with expecting eyes) Don't talk to me.

ME: Alright.

DANIEL: Don't try anything.

t3_d2qud7,"We all know the music is repetitive, but it's not supposed to be at full-blown Cantina Band level.","For the past decade, I've worked in women's fashion retail. This story is from a couple of years ago, when I was a full-time assistant manager at a store in the mall. We had a staff of about a dozen people at any given time.  

My store had one of those music systems where new songs and playlists are automatically pushed to the hard drive every month. Corporate tended to keep the playlists pretty static, however, only tossing a few new songs in here and there. It was pretty standard retail pop music, and it all kind of blended together over the months and years.  

Is it any wonder we barely noticed when the playlist started to dwindle? The computer was deleting songs by its schedule, but not receiving any new downloads. Normally, we'd hear the same songs every day, but only once. We caught on when we started to hear the same songs multiple times. HelpDesk was in no hurry to do their job. We watched (listened?) helplessly as the selection narrowed more and more over the next few weeks, until it was down to about a dozen songs on repeat.  

One morning, I went in with my sales associate to open the store. It was one of the last few days before Labor Day Weekend. I turned on the music when it was time to open the doors, and ""Elastic Heart"" by Sia was playing. Neither of us really made a note of that... at first. That song ended, and the next song began.  

&gt;""... hey, didn't we just hear this song?"" my associate asked.   
&gt;""What? Uh... did we?"" I responded, honestly uncertain, and distracted by morning paperwork.  
&gt;""I'm pretty sure we did,"" she said.  
&gt;""Well, maybe it's the end of the playlist, and it just happened to restart the shuffle with the same song,"" I suggested. She agreed that might be it.   

But in our (elastic) hearts... we felt a deep sense of dread. And our fears were confirmed when the song proceeded to play a third time in a row. We laughed, since that's about all we could do, especially since HelpDesk was ""aware of the problem"" already. I wanted to just turn it off, but my associates couldn't handle the quiet.  

Over the first three days, Elastic Heart would've played approximately 453 times during open hours. I, personally, would've heard it 280 times over my three shifts (not counting my breaks, or non-open hours). Even if I were only subjected to five hours of music per shift, (which would be a conservative estimate, especially since the holiday weekend meant everyone was almost always on the sales floor), I still would've heard it about 200 times in 72 hours.  

Sure, we laughed at the absurdity, and we had the comedy of watching customer reactions as they tried to remember whether or not they had just heard the same song. Still, combined with the stress of the holiday weekend, tempers started to fray. Even the customers were more irritable, and they only had to hear the song a handful of times. I've often wondered about the deleterious psychological effects of involuntarily hearing the same few songs on a loop. Hearing just the one song, over and over, for hours and days on end... well, that takes it from brainwashing to downright torture. The humorous aspects soon withered, and I felt like we were lab rats being experimented upon.  

I couldn't take it anymore, and refused to turn it on by the fourth day, no matter what the part-timers said. To add to the nonsense, the music system didn't have any standard jacks or plugs, so we couldn't just hook our phones up and play something else over the stereo. We ended up bringing in our own Bluetooth speakers and using our personal data plans to stream music (because, of course, the store did not have wifi).  

Fixing it was a huge PITA and involved a lot of phone tag when I could get time away from the sales floor, but I eventually emerged victorious.  

... that is, until the following year, when it happened AGAIN. With the SAME SONG. I think I still have a twitch whenever I hear it.  

TL;DR: Over Labor Day Weekend, the store's music system deleted all the songs off its hard drive except ""Elastic Heart"" by Sia, and the associates insisted on keeping the stereo on. We lasted three days before taking matters into our own hands.",TalesFromRetail

t3_d2qn3l,Online mistakes,"I was reading a story earlier which reminded me about this experience from about 7 years ago. I used to work in the complaints team for a large, reputable department store in the UK. Being in the complaints team, I would usually only see complaints from customers whose issues could not or had not been fixed by the Customer Services departments. We were well respected within the organisation, as every member of the team had a lot of Customer Services experience and had time and authority to resolve almost any problem. Complaints sent to the Managing Director  and other executives within the company would be sent to my team to deal with.
 
One time I received a call from the Customer Services department. A customer was on the line complaining that we'd gotten his online order wrong. The customer had ordered some kind of face cream, listed as 6x30ml pots of face cream, costing in the region of £400 (I forget the exact amount). He had called a couple of days earlierto say he had received the order and received 6x5ml pots. The call handler at that point replaced his order and wrote off the pots he initially received, meaning that the customer could keep them, free of charge. The customer had received the replacement product but it was the same thing; 5ml pots instead of 30ml pots. The customer was furious and the Customer Service rep transferred him over to me.
 
After about 5 minutes of shouting about how incompetent our company were (these 5 minutes were the best part of any call - I would never need to pay attention and could let my mind wander as I'd heard it all a million times), I told the customer I would make some enquiries and call him back. I contacted the buyer for this product and learned that it was incorrectly listed on the web. It was 6x 5mls, or 30mls total; not 6x30mls. What he received was correct, and the buyer immediately went away to correct the website.
 
I called the customer back and explained that there is a problem on the website and we are correcting it now. However the products he has been sent is correct and we do not have the product he thought he ordered. I explained that he has two options: Keep what he has been sent at the price he paid for it (essentially a buy one get one free offer) or send it all back and receive a full refund plus £50 cash (not a gift card) as an apology for the mistake.
 
The customer refused both of my offers (cue another, longer rant, and me sitting back to enjoy a further 10 minutes of not having to do anything) and said he wants what he ordered. C (customer)- ""You HAVE to honour the contract! It's the law"".
 
Me- ""No sir. We don't have that product in stock. We can't send it to you. It has been corrected on the website now - look."" And, sure enough, the website had been fixed already and the correct volume was shown. ""If you send us the products back I'll give you a full refund and transfer £50.00 into your bank account by way of apology. The postage is 100% free or I can even send a courier to pick them up from you tomorrow morning to save you the hassle.""
 
C- ""I can't send them back. I've given them away to friends who've already used them.""
 
Me- ""Well in that case, feel free to keep the 6 pots sent to you originally. You're quite right, we did tell you days ago to keep them. Send us the other 6 back which you just received an hour ago, and I'll give you a full refund. Or, you can keep all of them at the price you've paid, and I'll still send you £50.00 as an apology for the mix-up.""
 
C- ""No, you need to send me the amount of cream I ordered.""
 
I quickly worked out that what he was asking me for was £2400 worth of product for only £400. This was beyone the remit of even my team. I spoke to my manager and explained the situation. We both felt that the customer knew that he wouldnt be getting 6x30ml pots before he placed the order but that he was trying his luck to take advantage of the error. It was probable that he had sold them on Ebay rather than giving them to friends. Even if it had been an honest mistake, which we had to assume it was, I was offering the customer to keep £400 worth of products absolutely free. And still, this wasn't good enough. After a few minutes, we decided that we would refund him the full purchase price of his order and allow him to keep everything that he had received.
 
Was the customer content with this? Of course not. C-""YOU HAVE TO SEND ME THE AMOUNT OF CREAM I ORDERED!""
 
I told the customer that was his only option. Processed the the refund there and then and told the customer our address to write a complaint if he wanted to take it up further. He did. Two days later I got an email from the Managing Director with the letter from this customer attached. He asked me to respond to the customer on his behalf, and told me that he felt the offer made had been fair. I gleefully wrote to the customer, enclosing a copy of the MD's email to me, explaining that the offer he had been given was fair and reasonable and that there would be no further discussion on the matter. I never heard from the customer again after that.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d2k9lt,Whole family comes to shoplift not once... not twice... but THREE times.,"This is another story from my time working at a store going through liquidation during the summer of 2019.

Around when I had first started, I became grossly aware about how bad of a problem shoplifting actually was in retail, or at least at my job. 

The first time this family came in we were able to scare them away. While we couldn’t really do anything to stop shoplifters if we saw them (most we could do was yell and hope to embarrass them enough to put the stuff back or tell our managers and then keep an eye out for them again) when we knew one was in the store, everyone came to the floor. Both managers, all the leads, even people in the back in charge of getting big orders out to customers for pickup. With us all on the floor, most shoplifters would give up and leave whatever they were trying to steal on a shelf. 

The first time this family came in, we all quickly focused in on the mother who was the most obvious. She actually came up to some of my coworkers asking us where certain things were, and since we hadn’t caught her actually trying to steal yet (she was acting really shady though) we couldn’t do anything but give her vague answers. After a while they did end up leaving with some stuff bc one of my coworkers got lazy and didn’t care to watch, but we did make the husband and son leave their stuff. None of us had expected the father and son, especially the kid because come on... that’s just sad, but they became uncomfortable because of how honed in on the mother we were. Once they were gone we could do nothing but sigh and move on with our jobs.

The second time they came in, I wasn’t working at the time. I only knew they came back because my coworkers told me when I had come in later the day. They had tried to get out with some expensive shoes and tools, but they ditched them by what was left of our selection of refrigerators. I was also told a week or so later by my manager that when cameras were checked from another store these people had hit, these people actually snuck out the back and stole someone’s car to get away. 

By this point we had actually given these people nicknames and my manager was fuming. I had been told stories about how this woman literally chased down shoplifters in the past, so not being able to get these people was eating at her. About another week went by and the mother and father came back without their kid. My coworker instantly came over to me and told me to watch for her and stay by the mall entrance by my registers. I made my other coworker stay at the registers and watch the changing rooms while I “cleaned” the racks by the mall entrance. The untrustworthy coworker who let them get away the first time was at the other exit and so after a few minutes I went over there while another coworker took my place. I really didn’t trust this coworker to not let them slip out without any issues again. When I got over there I saw my manager on her phone while she was telling another worker to go outside and follow the woman. 

Apparently the shoplifter had walked up to my manager asking where a certain item was, and my manager called the cops right in front of her and told them that there was a shoplifter currently in the store. The woman ran out right as that happened, leaving whatever she had on the counter by the registers on that end of the store. My coworker came back inside and said the lady went into a different entrance to the mall, and my manager began making her way to the back of the mall thinking the husband was meeting her back there like they had before. My manager was gone for over an hour before I saw her again, looking particularly proud. I never got to ask her what happened, but the smug look she had on her face gave me reason to believe the woman and her husband would not be returning to steal again.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d27dnz,I should've used gloves,"So, I used to work at a popular retail chain where the return policy was (and still is) suuuper lax. Even if customers didn't have a receipt or the item is clearly decades old, 99% of the time managers approve returns. I was working returns that afternoon and business was pretty slow. It was just two of us at the counter and we'd have many three or four people in line, at best.

This older woman came up to my till for a return on deli chicken wings. While I asked her what was wrong with it, I opened the bag to see what we were working with. The most putrid stench of rotting food just blasted in my face. It was as if she'd eaten the chicken, tossed the bones then dug them back out of the garbage for a refund. Keeping a straight face I asked her, ""what was wrong with the food?"" She explained how the chicken was dry and tasteless and that she wanted her money back.

Okay...I asked for a receipt and she told me it was in the bag. I pick through it with the tips of my fingers and lo and behold, the receipt is at the bottom, covered in slime. Except all that ooze ended up erasing all the printer ink on the receipt. So I told her, ""I can't make out the transaction number, I'll have to speak to a manager"" She said ""you do whatever you have to do, baby"" and mentioned how she knew one specific manager. I called that one and he arrived quickly and actually did know the customer! He hugged her and they chatted while he processed her return without receipt. She got her cash back and they let me go wash my hands.

I’m not having a good day. I was fine the whole rest of the day up until I went to work and then everything crumbled. I’m fairly certain I’m getting a flu or cold because, as soon as I entered work, I was cold and hot, mildly dizzy, exhausted, and my left knee is swelling. I’m overweight so the knee isn’t new but it hurts to walk, sit, or get on my knees. I only had a 5 hr shift so I decided to suck it up because I needed the money. 

It was the longest 5 hr shift of my life. 

There was only 20minutes left and I was dead tired. I have a resting jerk face and it’s not getting any prettier as a migraine starts rolling in. 
An elder woman gets in the line and she’s a sassy one. 
“You never said hello to me.”
“Aren’t you going to ask if I have a rewards card?”
She’s not trying to be funny. She’s dead serious. 
What a peach.
I didn’t say anything because 1) Too tired 2) too nice 3) my boss is standing behind me 4) I can see a pick line inserted in her arm so I figure she’s just having a bad day and 5) rude customers are nothing new.
Then she says the line that made me want to chuck her items into the street. 
“You should smile more. Life is too short.”
I about lost it but thankfully I was too exhausted. She leaves and I say nothing. 
Her words have been playing on repeat. The more I think about them, the more I want to scream. I cried in my car because I know that phrase all too well. 
“Life is too short.”
This year I attended a funeral for a friend from work. She died suddenly from a pulmonary embolism and left behind four kids and a husband. She was only 40.
Last year my grandma lost her husband to cancer. She couldn’t attend Christmas the year before because she was too busy feeding him morphine pills so he wouldn’t be in pain. 
The year before that, we lost our uncle on our grandma’s side. He contracted pneumonia when his immune system was already low and my grandma and mom got a call he was dying. That day my grandma lost her younger brother and my mom last herself to alcoholism. 
Every year since 2012, I’ve gone to a funeral due to a death in the family. It sucks every time but I don’t bring my grief to work. Even if Ive had an awful day, I try not to take it out in someone else because that person doesn’t deserve to have their day ruined too. I don’t want to put my pain on a pedestal, I don’t thirst for others pity, but I do want to give perspective. I do however, accept hugs. In fact I shall now give you all a virtual hug. Whether you had a great day or a bad day, here’s a hug. Whether you’ve  had a good year or a bad year, here’s a hug. You if hate hugs then I’ll give you a handshake and a thumbs up. Maybe even cheer you on from the sidelines. And a message to that lady and all the Karen’s of the world.
Life is too short to spread poison to others who are just trying live their lives. 

Ps: another message to that lady, sorry I was probably scowling the whole time I was ringing you up. I was exhausted and in pain. No excuse for your attitude but I beg your forgiveness if it looked like I had one. Hugs!",TalesFromRetail
t3_d29scu,Online shoppers going to brick and mortar,"Hey guys I’m on mobile and not very good at formatting, but here you go!

  So I manage  a vape shop which none of you have probably ever heard of considering we are only in one state, and today I had the greatest customer of all time!

  A little bit ago I had a customer come into the shop and ask for 3 very specific items. No problem I have all 3! I start to ring said customer out, double checking each product to make sure they are correct for the customer. Then I tell them the total.

  Also we don’t have a website that tells what products we carry and prices this is kind of important.

Me: that’ll be $67.54 (or whatever the price was)

C: wait it’s how much?

Me: $67.54

C: I checked online and it said product was on sale

Me: I’m sorry this product is not on sale here it’s $30

C: well why did your website say it was on sale

Me: our website does not have any prices or products on it, are you sure you checked our website?

C: YES! It said it was on sale!

Me: If you can show me I will honor it (knowing it’s not on our website)

C: *pulls up online vape shop* SEE!

Me: I’m sorry that is not our website that is an online only store not even affiliated with our store

C: YOU JUST TOLD ME YOU WOULD HONOR IT!

Me: yes if it was at our stores website, I’m sorry for any inconvenience. That’ll be $67.54

C: well I don’t have that

Me: okay no problem! Have a good day

The customer left in a huff. Well it’s a pretty short one but I find it hilarious that they can’t even read what site they are looking at before running to the closest shop around them thinking that the sale is there.

TLDR: customer thinks random website is ours and wants me to honor the sale price of that website.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d2a0ug,"I'm not putting that in there! or, How to quickly disassemble your new crate engine!","As long as I've been on the topic of extraordinarily stupid things a certain ex-employer of mine had me do, this one shines. From the world of auto parts.

So I have a guy come to me who wants an engine ordered. Nothing unusual about this. He orders up a mild crate engine (crate engine means fully assembled, usually shipping in a crate).

The engine shows up a week or so later and I give him a phone call to let him know it's arrived. He says he will be by shortly, and sure enough, he was there within the hour.

I ask if he has the core (old engine) with him, but he doesn't, I still have to keep the crate at the store until he returns it though. The crate is used to ship back his old ""core"" engine. I uncrate the engine and hoist it up on a lift and he backs his truck to the loading doors. Just one problem, I've got an assembled engine up on a hoist, and he's got a completely empty truck bed. Like, there's no palette, tires, nothing.

He gets out of his truck and tells me to lower it into the truck bed.

Me: Uh, what are you putting under it?

Customer: What? Nothing, just put it down.

Me: No, definitely not. It can't sit on the oil pan, it'll crush.

Customer: Just bring it down, I'm not going far.

Me: No, you aren't hearing me, it will damage the engine, and it will move.

Customer: Look, I only live a few blocks over the freeway, less than 5 minutes, just put it in.

Me: **NO!** It's dangerous and I'm not doing it. \*I'm getting irritated at this point\*

Customer: It's *my* engine and *my* truck, just load it and I'll deal with it. \*he's getting irritated too\*

Me: I'm sorry, I'm not doing this, you're going to have to come back with a tire and some straps or something, I don't have anything to spare you.

At this point he's gotten angry at my repeated refusals to put the engine in the bed of his truck, he's pissed, I'm pissed and he storms back to his truck. I close the loading doors and get back to other things when the phone rings. I answer, it's corporate.

Corporate: You have a customer picking up his engine there and you are refusing to load it?

Me: YES! It's unsecured! He has nothing to put it on or tie it down with!

Corporate: Have him sign a waiver and load the engine into his vehicle as requested.

Me: What!? NO! It will smash the oil pan or valve covers for sure!

Corporate: Just have him sign the waiver and do it. \*click\*

Fine, fuck it. The guy is already back in the store staring at me so I print up a waiver and have him sign, then lower the engine into the back of his truck. I put it down as gently as I could with the hoist and managed to set it down without crushing the pan. I roll the hoist back inside and he closes his tailgate. 

I go back inside and wash my hands (greasy from hoist).

About ten minutes later, I head outside for a smoke break, and when I get outside, I notice traffic is backed up the hill, very unusual for this part of town and it's a total standstill. I walk out to the road and look down the street. A block down at the peak of the freeway overpass, is Customer and his truck.

Well, most of his truck. The tailgate is hanging off and is bent like a V.

His engine is all over the road. The oil pan is down the street, the valve covers are off, and most of the valvetrain is in the street. Traffic is stopped for BOTH lanes going over the freeway since it's full of engine parts that this guy is now picking up piece by piece.

I just laughed and lit up my cigarette. Had a most enjoyable smoke break while I watched him trying to push the block off the roadway. Then the local PD showed up and ticketed him. A *most* enjoyable break.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d2cdh6,No Sir we cannot change the Music,"So this is a story of when I used to work in the big corporation store in the ends of every mall in California... 

Anyway this happened on one of my Fitting Room shifts... Little backstory for anyone who's never been inside of a retail store of any kind.. We got 5 songs total and it plays on a loop. And you would think ""Oh this is fine like its pop songs right. 20% correct. 1 is Shape of You by Ed Sheeran, but the other 4 are obscure songs... Like the ones that you have on your I tunes or Spotify that say ""Various Artists"" and that was that. Drove me up the wall every second of every day.

\*Enter Older dad with his adult son\* (OD for older dad, AS adult son, Me for me)

Me: ""How's it going? Are you guys finding everything okay today?""

AS ""Yeah dude we are cool we are just getting these dress shirts and we are dipping""

OD ""You know what would really help us out.. \*Long pause\* if you could change this music""

Me ""Sir I do not think that I could do that there is no music player in this store""

OD ""Well then get your General Manager to come out here and change the song""

First off the general manager was in Europe or something so obv that's not happening

We were also trying to save face on reviews also so no customer left with a bad taste in their mouth, therefore when it came to me I redirected

Me ""Sir I am sorry there is no music player but if you want to see a manager they usually hang out on the first floor of the store in the service desk""

OD ""Well then that's where I'll go""

At this point I knew that I would never see this man again as I got off shift in like 10 minutes, also that poor service desk person always got these people, anyone with a grievance towards me that wasn't personal got told the same thing, do i feel bad about it?

t3_d2aalw,Tales From The Farmers' Market: When Humour Backfires. My work here is done…,"For many years I have been helping out a farmer friend at a couple of farmers' markets. He grows and sells a wide range of organic vegetables, which are freshly picked and beautifully presented at the stall. We both have a quirky (and occasionally dark) sense of humour, and believe that shopping for food should be fun. 

&amp;nbsp;

We've always had quirky signs. Some have images that are Dadaesque, bearing no relation to the product advertised. Some have odd descriptions, some are simply funny marketing (an example of the latter is baby summer squash labelled as ""Squash Kittens""). We've been known to put up signs indicating we're out of a product, or that a much-demanded product is not in season, so you'll see ""Parsnip-Free Zone"" or ""Early birds swiped the baby spinach"". 

One fine morning at market we ran out of something (I forget what, this was years ago) and the empty basket was still sitting out. I took this as a comic opportunity and elected to write a quick sign indicating our lack of product. I settled on ""[Zen Lettuce](https://imgur.com/a/C9OsAdZ)"", scrawled it on the back of an old sign and clipped it to the basket. A few people noticed it and smiled, some passed comment on it and continued the joke. It was successful enough that we did it again. One customer's young son decided this was a vegetable he could deal with and would come to get Zen vegetables every week. Some didn't get the joke and we'd have to explain and dissect the frog¹.

The sign and its variants continued to be a feature at our stand, to the point where we'd sometimes even set up an empty basket at the start of the day so we could put it out. It became a feature along with the banter between the farmer and me.

&amp;nbsp;

Many winters passed. Helpers came and went, but the joke sign would still feature on our display. Cue the bureaucrat. Every so often, someone from the County Agricultural Department would come to inspect everyone at the market. They were supposed to check that our scales were tested and sealed, that our permits and papers were up to date, and that everything we sold was on the list the farmer had approval to grow. You can see where this is going.

I'd just hired some new help. Let's call her Ruth. She was on duty when the inspector came, I was off buying my groceries. I returned to find her in a bit of a tizzy. I'd love for her to tell the story here in her own words, but for now I'll have to paraphrase. The Humourless Bureaucrat makes his appearance.

&gt;***HB:*** I need your paperwork.

&gt;***Ruth:*** There's paperwork?

&gt;***HB:*** Permits, insurance, planting plans, organic certification. It's all supposed to be on display.

&gt;***Ruth:*** *(a little flustered, I'd not told her about the clipboard, though it was clipped to one of the tent struts)* Um…

&gt;***HB:*** You're supposed to present it on demand!

&gt;***Ruth:*** *(finally twigging what the clipboard was for)* Here it is!

&gt;***HB:*** Harrumph.*(Rustles through everything, checks the display, ticks things on his clipboard)*

&amp;nbsp;

The dialogue paused as he went through everything we had out and checked it against our planting plan. There's always a question or two here as sometimes the signs don't *exactly* reflect what's on the papers. Squash Kittens are not listed, for example, and what we grow as ""curly endive"" is on the sign as ""frisee"". 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;***HB:*** *(After much frantic rustling through ten pages of planting lists)* There's something missing! This ""Zen Vegetable"" is not accounted for!

&gt;***Ruth:*** …

&gt;***HB:*** This is not right! You can't sell something you don't have in the plan!

&gt;***Ruth:*** Well, we aren't actually selling Zen Vegetable.

&gt;***HB:*** You have a basket with a sign for it!  

&gt;***Ruth:*** Well, it's sort of a joke, you see.

&gt;***HB:*** …

&gt;***Ruth:*** *(Explains the joke, dissects the frog. Nobody benefits and the frog dies)*

&gt;***HB:*** *(Leaves in angry bewilderment)*

&amp;nbsp;

After I returned (this had taken some ten minutes), Ruth told me what had happened, to everyone's great delight.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;***wertperch:*** My work here is done.


&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR:** County Inspector gets upset that they can't complete their damned paperwork due to a comedy sign for a non-existent ""Zen vegetable"". There was much wailing and gnashing of teeth on their part, and barely-concealed mirth on ours. I love messing with a jobsworth bureaucrat.

t3_d2d9cq,"2 Jobs, 2 Robberies, Same guy","So i used to live in this town that was small but the crime rate was really high, especially around the holidays.

I worked at a gas station for 6 years and always had a side job for extra money. This story starts at one of my part time jobs at a game store.

I had just started working that day and the ast. manager was there with me. A kid walks in, he's about 15, he ask to look at the used handhelds.
We point him in the direction, and continue to do inventory checks and deal with customers. When the store was empty, he asked the ast. Manager if he could look at one and make sure it works. Thinking nothing of it, he hands him the game system. We were both there, watching him, helping him with questions. He then asked ""does it play those games"" pointing behind us, as we both look back behind us, ""ding dong"" the door alarm. He stole the handheld. We looked at each other as to say ""did that..what?"". Called the cops as we watched him run across the parking lot. He ran behind a store across the driveway from our store.

The cops show up and as I'm describing the kid, i see him walking with his head down from afar.
Apparently the kid had a get away plan with his older buddies and they left cause he took to long. So the cops took him hone and we got the game back.

Now 3 years later, i have quit that game store job but i still worked at the gas station. I was heading into work early and i noticed 2 men running out of the store. My cashier ran outside crying and screaming. I zoomed my truck behind the store thinking that they lived behind the store in a small community and i was going to cut them off. But they were get in a car by the coin operated vacuum and i hit there car, pinning the rear of the car between my truck and the vacuum. I get out of my truck and they get out of the car. They started to run and then stopped. One said to the other ""get the gun"", I panicked and ran to get between their car and them. I chased them across the road. Telling people to stop them, and of course they didn't. I gave up, thinking we have their car the cops can handle the rest. I see the police zoom by us and down the road as im waving trying to flag them down. We had another bigger store 4 miles down the road with the same name. They thought it was that one. As im walking back to the store. I see one of the guys walking back to get the car i guess. 

I lock eyes and said ""come on then!"". He did, we wrestled and i banged up his head a little bit. I noticed he looked familiar. Finally i had him pinned to the ground. My cashiers bf pulls up and i tell him to hold him down as i catch my breathe. Next thing i see is this guy running to the car. Im like ""how the heck you let him up?"" Followed by the thought of that guy saying ""get the gun"". I took of running into the store. 

The cops finally get there, they scan the area. Found 1 of the guys hiding near the railroad tracks. Brought him to the store so we can id him. Then it hit me .. same kid from the game store. WOW.

I totaled out their car and the other guy was caught later.

t3_d1x7yf,The one where my dumbass returned $300 of stolen goods,"Alright so this happened a few years ago when I was 17. I (thankfully) don’t work retail any more but kudos to all of you out there still fighting the good fight. 

Anyway I was 17 and I was working my first job at a pretty major US home/furniture retailer and let me say I have never, ever worked at a place that was easier to steal from. Obviously I’m not speaking from personal experience but shrink was a constant and pervasive problem at this store yet for some reason the upper management never took steps to stop it like installing those detector things, having regular security or basically anything besides saying “watch out for people stealing.” 

Anyway, I was a young naïve cashier and one day this lady came in to return all of this bedding and some other random household odds and ends. She didn’t have a receipt (not uncommon at this store we did a lot of returns without receipts) so she could only get store credit and as I told her this I was worried that she would be mad because people usually liked to give me grief for that and she had a ton of stuff but she was cool about it so I was happy and started returning everything. 

As I’m returning all of these items she started telling me about how her engagement was called off and how these had all been gifts she now had no need for and I was doing my best to console this lady as best as a high school who has no frame of reference for that kind of thing can. 

Her return total was something like over $300 so I was like, “oh I need to call a manager over to approve this” since our limit was something like $150 without manager approval. 

Then this lady starts to get nervous for reasons I can’t figure out because she’s about to get $300 in store credit! This is great for her! Then the GM comes and starts looking at things and getting this concerned look on his face and my dumb 17 year old brain still can’t figure out what’s happening. He tells me to just complete the transaction then he calls over the other manager so I do what he tells me but I’m still like ??????

The GM then ran all the product codes through our system aaaaaaand we had no record of ever having sold those items! I was conned into giving some random lady $300 in store credit that was I guess fraudulent. 

The manager (who was known for being a meanie) started yelling at me telling me this lady was going to go sell that gift card for crack and I was just like what crack dealer accepts gift cards to furniture stores? But then the GM (who was a super nice guy) calmed her down and said it was their fault for not training me for things like that so I got to keep my job but boy did I feel like a dumb ass after that one. Still haunts me to this day. And I also have a feeling that lady was never engaged....",TalesFromRetail

Go ahead, call corporate, I'm not taking it back.","Remembered about this thanks to a customer just asking for a refund on parts they didn't buy here.

So I'm a manager at a certain corporate auto parts chain. One of the ones that only gets parts from one source, so if you go there, they can either get it, or not. No choices on brands.

Corporate: Yes, you have a customer there in the last hour trying to return a part?

Corporate: Yes. Give it to him.

Me: ....What? It's not ours.

Corporate: Give him the refund, in cash.

Me: It's not our part.

Corporate: I'm aware of that, issue the refund.

Me: I *can't* take it back, it's NOT ours! It's not in the system!

A few minutes later...

Corporate: Here is how you will add a new part number to the system \*explaining instructions\*

Me: How?! We have no internet access remember?

Corporate: Use your phone.

Me: The one I'm not supposed to be carrying?

Yes, this asshat actually had me use my own personal device, that I wasn't supposed to be carrying, to violate company policy and access the internet on company time. To find an arbitrary price and give a cash refund for a part that wasn't ours. 

Then when he came in, I had to ring it out, because manager with password.

I use to work in the beauty industry at a retail store. It was a similar store to the orange beauty retailer and similar to the white and black retailer, but it was a much smaller version of them. Anyways...

We had a lady come in and go straight to the Peter Thomas Roth skin care, which was the most expensive skin care brand we had.  I was busy washing brushes and the other associates were helping guests, so we had no idea what was happening. This lady was opening boxes of product and putting the unboxed product into her Louis Vuitton purse, then sticking the boxes on the shelf. Literally everything was caught on camera. Then, she came up to the register to return everything she had just put in her bag. She was hoping for cash or store credit, but since she had no proof of purchase she was denied the return - and she left the store...with all the product. 

Shortly after she left, we found the 5 empty boxes on the shelf and immediately realized what had happened. I immediately called the orange beauty store, which was just across the lot from us, and informed them that they may have a woman coming in to return a ton of skin care product and to not accept the return, and that we had already called the police. The store told me she had JUST left their store after trying to do a return, and she was denied there as well. 

I knew the only other place she would go would be the white and black beauty store about five minutes away, so I called there next. Thankfully a friend of mine answered and she kept me on the line when the woman arrived. My friend had called loss prevention (LP), and she tried to keep the woman at her register until LP showed up. Unfortunately, the woman was onto her and ran out of the store. With no other store in the area that sold the product, we figured that was it and she was going to try to sell on the Facebook marketplace or something for a quick buck, so we waited. We figured the woman wouldn’t be back at either store since we all had eyes on her and knew she was a thief. 

*However*, the very next day I’m at work and the store phone rings - it’s the orange beauty store. The woman has come back to get her hair done, so she’ll be there for at least an hour. We call the police and inform them, and one of my store’s employees runs over to FaceTime the entire thing. 

The police show up, and having already known what happened the day before, they’re ready. They end up arresting this woman with foils still in her hair, and that’s the end of that! Unfortunately we never got the product back, but we had one less person to worry about! 

I really hope that was worth the read. Sorry for any errors!",TalesFromRetail

t3_d1w0w7,Wrong Product? Give me the discount on the Coupon anyways!,"Some set up is needed first, as this is only partially my story.

Over the summer, I was working at a grocery store in order to have some extra money before I went off to college. One of my coworkers and I were the only cashiers in between the shifts of the morning workers and evening workers (There are four who work in the morning, two who come in when they get off around noon, giving the mid-morning workers about two hours before the evening and night workers come in), and at the same time that week was our double coupon week where, as the name states, coupons are worth double.   


There's a decent lull in customers, so CW and I are just hanging out at our registers, talking about this or that (I was asking if he needed a ride back home, he was asking about when I was heading off to college, etc. Nothing super important) between the few customers showing up.   


Its a bit later when lo and behold, an older lady (OL) comes up with a cart full of items. 

No big deal, that's pretty normal and as I move to go help him bag the items, someone comes to my lane so I apologize and start ringing the customer up.  A few more customers show up and hop into my lane since I tend to work pretty fast and most of them don't have many items to ring up— Fruit which codes I knew by memory, small items, that sort of thing. 

I'm ringing up someone, keeping an ear out for CW since we've had issues in the prior week with haggling attempts and other coupon issues, and I hear CW apologizing.   


CW: I'm sorry ma'am, this coupon isn't ringing up. The system says that it doesn't match the sale.

OL: The coupon says that \[x\] product is 50%

CW: Yes, I know, I can call someone over, but I can't assure you that the coupon will work

(both CW and I had been told to call someone from Customer Service or a manager over if there were issues with coupons, since there were only two of us working register)

OL, huffing: Please, do

By now I figure that CW has if covered, so I'm mostly focusing back on my own work, only slightly glancing over when CW calls our CS Manager (M) over, as he had sent our CS worker on break while he was working on the next week's work schedule.

The manager walks over, asks what the issue is, the usual procedure and CW tells him the issue. At this point, there's no one in my line, so I'm actively listening as I face the end of my lane. Manager scans the coupon, as you do, and the same thing pops up on the register screen. The coupon does not match the previous sale. Manager reads the coupon slowly before he tells her the exact same thing that CW had told her.

M: Ma'am, we can't use this coupon for you today, since you don't have \[x\] (he looks in the bags), you do have \[y\] but \[y\] is not covered by this coupon.

OL: But I got \[y\]

M: yes. But this coupon only covers \[x\] not \[y\]

This goes on for a bit, and by a bit, I mean a good ten minutes, but eventually, OL takes the coupon back in a huff and pays. Not really super climatic, as most people just give up when our Managers show up and firmly tell them that there's nothing to be done, but still.

t3_d1dpu7,Woman threatens to vomit on merchandise after I wouldn’t give her a discount. Then actually does.,"Obligatory on mobile so my apology for formatting error. As for grammar and punctuation I’m just an idiot. 

So I worked at a certain phone company as a “wireless consultant” which is basically just a cashier that can change your phone plan and take your money for accessories and what not.  Well we had a strict policy where if you buy a phone case or something of the sort and want to return it, you have to pay a 25% restocking fee.  People often got annoyed at this so we would have them sign a waiver on the receipt that says they understand this is a rule.

So this elderly Karen looking woman maybe around the age of 70ish comes in to return an item (don’t remember what exactly). Okay that’s fine. I ring up her return and give her 75 percent of the price back to her. 

Cue mental breakdown. She says “I never knew about that policy” and “that is stupid” “I have been with this company for years and you should respect me” blah blah blah. I tell her to give me the receipt so I can look at it. On the back of the receipt it very plainly says in big words “there is a 25% restocking fee on all returned accessories”. Directly under that was her signature.

This escalated even worse and she began yelling and cussing and finally she looked me dead in the eyes and said “if you don’t give me all of my money back I’m going to throw up all over”. I tried to hold back my laughter but I couldn’t help but let the smallest smirk cross my face because of how ridiculous this situation was. 

For context this item was maybe 35 USD new so we are talking like 8 bucks she doesn’t get back. And normally I’d cave for such a little amount and refund the whole thing, however, I was not a manager and did not have to code to do this.

She storms off and walks out the door. Not even 2 minutes later she comes steaming back in slams her finger down her throat and sent her grandma juice all over the phone cases on the wall. 

At this point I was stunned and can’t believe what was happening. I used all of my 7 hour communication training to handle the situation. 

Me: “ma’am please don’t throw up on the merchandise”

Her: *shoves finger down throat and vomits on phone charger accessories*

Me: “ma’am I am going to call the police”

Her: *proceeds to vomit on the counter I was standing behind*

Me: *petrified* 

Her: *starts to leave, and on the way out looks at me, then sends it one more time on the glass door*

Cops come, they honestly had a hard time believing what I said. They told me there wasn’t a whole lot they could do. Manager comes in from her off day and tells me to clean it up. I quit. That was the first and only retail job I ever worked.


TLDR: old woman was mad about restocking fee she knew about. Proceeds to vomit on all merchandise.",TalesFromRetail

t3_d19qlw,You're hiding it from me!,"As anyone who ever worked in UK retail up until a few years ago knows, the most exhausting yet often fun times to work used to be the last few hours before closing for a long bank holiday weekend. Most shops didn't open on Sundays and also stayed closed on the bank holiday.


This sent many customers into Panic Buying Mode with people stuffing their trolleys with half a dozen loaves of bread, six pints of milk, enough fruit and veg to keep Carmen Miranda in hats for a year, etc. As a result, by closing time there were usually many items sold out. 


One particular Saturday about ten minutes before closing a furious gent barreled up to me steaming like the Flying Scotsman.

There was this gentleman with his family shopping for his daughter, the whole family is with them. The daughter is getting five Nike brand items and five other brand items. 

We have a lovely card promotion going on where customers get 20% off for applying and 36% off when they get approved. The dad is in the family is the one buying the items, he tries at the beginning to get some discounts but I tell him of our deal. He says no at first. I start scanning the items. 

Everything is going good, we get towards the end and I tell him that he could save some money for applying and even if he doesn’t get approved, he still saves. He agrees right away, we go through the process then at the end he doesn’t get approved but I still explain that he saved for trying out. 

He comments about the additional percentage off, I try to explain that he saved some money for trying out. He gets mad and says I told him that he could get an additional percentage off. I call our newest captain over and explain the situation to her. She tries to explain to him about the percentage off for trying out. They tell back and forth. 

Then we end up calling a manager over, he explains to her his version of the story where I pretty much forced to him to apply for the card...at this point, I’m annoyed and offended and try to defend myself. The manager has to push me back some and I’m a little thing 😂. 

Then the wife gets her two cents in about me supposedly being rude and laughing in their faces, none of which I didn’t do. I didn’t figure out if they got an additional amount off because I had to go for my last break.

t3_d1hmj2,Getting filmed by a disgruntled clearance shopper who didn't want to pay 2 dollars more,"Ok, this just happened and it sort of blows my mind,  but here we go.

I'm not sure how clearance works for other stores, but for ""big southern department"" , it is usually 40% off the last price marked in red. This means that same style clothing can be marked slightly different based on color because the stock of one color was in the store longer than the others,  so its shelf life will show up cheaper than other colors. People get annoyed by this all the time, which is understandable,  and it is hard to explain it to them, but usually they don't mind paying the 1 or 2 dollar difference since it is on clearance price anyway.

Cut to this lady who we will call SundayBargains.

SundayBargains comes up to my register with several clearance dresses that are the same style but different colors. I ring them up not really paying attention to the prices until she interrupts. 

SundayBargains: um, why did only one dress ring up 7.99?

Sure enough, I check the last marked price, and only the yellow dress is 7.99 because it was marked lower than the others which were 9.99 after their last marked price. I try to explain to her that because the yellow dress was lower, it was most likely in store longer than the others. Kind of weird, but that's how clearance works. She is not having it.

SundayBargains: that makes absolutely no sense. I want to talk to a manager, and I'm going to  be documenting this and sending it in to corporate! What's your name? You're not even wearing a name tag! Clearly you do this shady stuff all the time if you dont want anyone knowing your name.

Ok, lady,  nevermind I had forgotten my name tag in my purse and was going to just put it on at lunch.

So I get the manager for her, and at first when I'm explaining it over the phone, the manager accidentally hangs up. This drives SundayBargains wild.

SundayBargains: so she hung up on you? I'm adding this to the report. 

Once the manager comes, she explains it the same way I did, and even lets SundayBargains see how the dresses ring up in our system. 

SundayBargains: They are all the same dress! They need to all be 7.99! Let me talk to the manager.

My manager: I am the manager, ma'am. If you would just let me talk, I'd be happy to explain it to you again.

SundayBargains: well I'm reporting this to corporate,  and your name is going in. I am through with this store after this! 

She is taking pics of her phone and filming to make sure she quotes me correctly in her ""report"".

At this point my manager just calls her out for being really aggressive and how she needs to calm down and actually let her explain the store policy. I wander off to help more customers...and when I return, SundayBargains has a smile on her face and says thank you before leaving without the dresses...

Not sure what happened, but jeez louise. All that fuss over 2 dollars....not to mention we had a 10% off clearance coupon, so she would have been getting them,  including the cheaper one for a dollar less. 

I can understand the frustration over not knowing the store policy, but this lady was looking to make a scene over something so simple. Glad we didn't change the price to appease the harpy, anyway. Any other of our managers would have.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d1i03j,What do you mean different items have different prices?,"This happened a few months ago, so some of the details are fuzzy, but the gist of it is all there.

I work in a tech store that sells quite a few computers. In our store a decent computer (one that you can work with and not want to rip your hair out) starts at around $650. We also have “value” computers that range from $150-$500. 

One day I am walking my section when I see a woman and her son standing at an end-cap that has a few of our value computers on it. There are three on that particular end-cap. Two are from the same brand with very similar internal specs. The main differences are that one is blue vs silver, and one is 11 inches while the other is 14 inches. These sizes are clearly labeled on both the info card and the box for the computer. 

Anyway, I asked the woman if I could help her. She asked me what the price of the 11 inch computer was, so I told her the price (let’s say $200). I could tell she was already in a bad mood, but she did *not* like my answer. She goes on to tell me that she had been in there about a week ago, picked up a computer from underneath the 11 inch spot and got charged $250 for it. I asked her if she knew which one it was and she pointed to one of the 14 inch ones. I clarified with her that it was the 14 inch one she picked up, not the 11 inch one. She got increasingly upset and asked me if there was any way that I could match that price for her. 

I told her unfortunately I couldn’t price match that item, to which she almost yelled at me that it was false advertising. I told her that normally we would be able to do a price match, but seeing as the box she picked up was clearly labeled differently than the item she was looking at (and since she realized that when she got it), I couldn’t do a price match or change the price. 
Not to be discouraged, she then asked if we could do a price change because the computer was a different color than she thought she was getting (again, very obvious as there is a picture of the computer on the box). I told her no once again and started trying to get out of the conversation. 

After a few times going back and forth she looked at me and basically said, “so I have to pay the extra $50?” I told her “if you want the bigger computer, yes”. She grabbed a computer, sighed dramatically, looked at me, and said “fine, but I’m never shopping here again!” as she stomped off to customer service. I cheerfully replied, “I’m sorry to hear that, I hope you have a great day!”

I learned later that she was looking at those computers that day because she had tried the same story at customer service with a manager before and had already gotten shut down once. 

TL;DR Woman doesn't understand the difference between 11 and 14 inches, demands a price match.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d1blgr,"Came in for a phone, gets caught cheating on his wife, stormed out and almost ran over two co-workers.","Yesterday while working in a retail store for a mobile carrier, a couple comes in to ask about their phones that are having issues maintaining a connection to their watches.  I wasn't working with them but I was standing close enough to hear the bulk of the conversation.  I was temporarily distracted for a few seconds but I noticed a shift in their conversation.  Apparently while she was waiting, she began closely examining their joint bank account and discovered something that lead her to believe her husband was cheating on her.  They briefly argue with slightly raised voices and she gets up and storms out to the car leaving her smartwatch behind in her haste.  The accused sheepishly walks out behind her without saying a word but you could tell he was absolutely furious because he was cheating and got caught.  The guy is driving and almost runs over two coworkers in front of me and four customer-witnesses while they were attempting to flag Cheaty McCheatface down to return their watch to them.

These two folks acted perfectly fine when they walked in and twenty minutes later their whole world shattered.  His reckless driving, disregard for the safety of my coworkers, his inability to remain faithful, and her overall reaction to this revelation of infidelity gave me the impression that the fallout will be swift and severe.

t3_d1f5f3,"""I can't believe they let a stupid cow like you work in this store!""","Warning: this is a long one.

So, this happened about two years ago, so I don't remember the exact words that were used during the confrontation, but it will still give you a pretty good idea. (Also, English is not my native language, so if you see any glaring mistakes, do tell me and I'll correct them XD).

After graduating uni I had a lot of trouble finding a job in my sector (this was before I went back to school to study to become a teacher) and after a couple of months I saw a supermarket half an hour away from my home was hiring and decided to give it a go.   
I was immediately hired as they are always short on staff and I started working the cash register and filling shelves, you know, the usual.  
One day, a woman walks up to me while I'm restocking crisps or something, asking me about a specific brand of milk (I don't remember which brand it was, only that it's not something that we had a lot of, because of rather low demands).   
I follow her to the dairy isle and, indeed, the brand of milk she wanted wasn't there.   
Now, I hadn't been working there long, so I wasn't really sure whether we still had some in the back or not. So I asked her if she was alright with waiting a few minutes while I went to ask a manager.   
She was a bit irritated at the wait (she looked to be in a hurry) but agreed.  
I went to a manager and she told me that we had indeed run out of that brand of milk and that, while the delivery truck could arrive any minute, she wasn't 100% sure when it would arrive (there'd been some kind of traffic jam on the way) and she also wasn't sure if that specific brand of milk would be in that delivery or in the one that was scheduled to arrive the next morning, or a few days after that. (Seeing as this was a rather low-demand product, apparently it could take a few days for a new delivery to be made).  
So I go back to the woman and tell her exactly what the manager had told me, adding that I could ask to hold aside a bottle (or 2, 3, how many she needed) for her the next morning, or any other day and that she could just ask for them at the area where we sold cigarettes and flowers, as there was usually at least one manager/senior store worker working there. I also added that if this were a problem, she could just call the store to ask whether the milk had been delivered already or not, in order to save her an extra trip to the shop. 

Woman: ""What kind of service is this? You always have this brand of milk. You should go look in the back, there's probably still a bottle there.""

Me: ""My manager said we were all out, but I'll go and take a look just to be sure. It's always possible we missed it.""  
I went to take a look and there really weren't any bottles left. I return to the woman and tell her we're out, but that there should be a new delivery of her milk the next morning or in a few days.

Woman: ""There *should* be? So, you're not really sure?""

Me: ""Ma'am, I'm just repeating what the manager told me, so yes, there *should* be a number of bottles coming in soon. But because of the rather low demand, it's always possible it takes a few more days. I can tell you that this brand has not been discontinued, so yes, we *should* get some bottles tomorrow or one of the next days.""

Woman: ""Well, since you're not able to get me my milk, can you please get me the brand of milk that resembles the one I want the most? Because that's the least you can do after wasting my time like this.""

Now, like I said, I hadn't been working there long, plus it was a store that sold a lot of products I'd never heard of, like that specific brand of milk, so I told her I didn't know, but I would go get someone else, whom I knew had been working in the store for several years and knew WAY more about the products than I did. 

The woman then suddenly starts poking her finger in my sternum, forcing me back a few steps, while she lays into me, calling me a 'stupid cow', 'lazy kid', someone who 'doesn't know what she's doing', and how it's a 'disgrace that they allow people like this to serve customers'. 

While I got that she was probably annoyed that her specific brand of milk was not available, and that I wasn't the most knowledgeable person working there, I wasn't just going to let her insult me like that. So I said - amidst her continuous ranting about my incompetence - that I would get someone else to help her, turned around and walked away.

Later, one of the other workers came up to me and said that this lady apparently always gives the workers a difficult time and that I shouldn't think too much of it.",TalesFromRetail

However those can make stories in them selves. There are some things you need to know first.

Tint = the stuff you put in paint to make it colored

So I called the MOD and he came over and was like “what’s the problem” and I replied “this guy is trying to return a bucket of paint and it’s water” he then opens the bucket, conforms it’s water, and says to the customer “Well there’s the problem, you just haven’t mixed it. If you want we can take you over to the paint desk and have it mixed.” To which the guy (not wanting to admit he’s wrong) hesitantly says “sure let’s do that.” So I watch as the MOD has the paint desk put tint in a bucket of water and mix it all the while the customer is standing there with look of defeat.

Slurred/mumbling speech, slow blinks, a sway in her movement even while 'still', and finally once she spoke up, the smell.

She asked for a cigar and matches (after much difficulty and a building line behind her) and after paying she's on her way...that is until I lament to the customer behind her that ""wow she doesn't seem done with last night's partying. She is suuuper drunk.""

I had a line of customers, so I asked if it wouldn't be too much trouble for him to call for me. He eagerly does so, and is ready to even go distract her to keep her there if need be (for reference I was alone at the time since my manager had to make a bank run).

Thankfully, firefighters were out collecting donations for their annual benefit, and we had an officer in less than 20 seconds, actually while my customer was talking with dispatch. The officer got out and spoke with her a bit until more showed up.

t3_d0v9ij,"""That's how it is in my job so that must be how it works here!""","For context, I need to give a description of how the credit card machines in my job work (this is important to the story.) This might be a little confusing but I'll do my best to explain. The credit card machines in my workplace turns on the contactless feature automatically when the sale begins, once the subtotal of the sale goes over €30 the machine automatically turns the contactless feature off and there is no way to manually turn it back on again, the machine does this because in my country you are only allowed pay contactless using your credit card for payments up to €30, and more than that is illegal because there is a risk of credit card fraud. However,  you are allowed to pay with contactless using your phone and there is no limit. But the credit card machines in my workplace haven't been updated to accommodate this, once the limit goes over €30 euro you can't pay using contactless regardless of whether you're using a phone or a credit card. This has been causing problems for a while because customers come in and try to pay for shopping over €30 with their phone and I then have to explain why it won't work. Most customers just say ""oh ok"" and pay using an alternative method of payment, a couple of customers get annoyed but only one customer has ever caused a big fuss about it, and this customer is the star of the story.

I was serving customers on the till when the customer approached with her shopping, we where making small talk as I was scanning and bagging everything and she seemed really nice at first. The problem arose when she wanted to pay with her phone but the total was over €30. I explained to her why she can't pay with her phone but she doesn't believe me.

Customer: ""No, you're wrong.""

Me: ""Um, excuse me?""

Customer: ""You're wrong. You just need to press the contactless button.""

Me: ""Ma'am, we don't have a contactless button here. The machine turns contactless on and off automatically.""

Customer: ""No it doesn't. You just haven't pressed the contactless button yet that's why it's not working.""

Me: ""I can't, we don't have a contactless button here. I have no manual control over the contactless function on the credit card machine. It's automatic.""

Customer: ""You do have control over it. You're just not listening to me. I'm trying to show you how to do your job but you just don't want to listen""

Me: ""I am listening to you but what your asking me to do is impossible because we don't have a contactless button.""

She starts to shout attracting the attention of other people in the store.

Customer: ""YES YOU DO. THAT'S HOW TO CREDIT CARD MACHINES WORK IN MY JOB SO THAT MUST BE HOW IT IS HERE!!!""

Me: ""Your workplace must use a different credit card system to ours.""

Customer: ""NO IT DOESN'T. ALL CREDIT CARD MACHINES ARE THE SAME.""

She then tells me to call a supervisor so that she can have someone who ""actually knows what they're doing"" to finish the sale. The supervisor arrives and I try explaining the issue but the customer cuts me off.

Customer: ""No that's not the problem. The problem is that he won't press the contactless button.""

The supervisor looks confused.

Supervisor: ""Um, ma'am we don't have a contactless button on our tills.

The customers starts screaming again.

Customer: ""YES YOU DO!!!""

Then the customer and the supervisor gets into a long argument about which one of them were right. The argument goes on for about 5-10 minutes and comes to an end when the supervisor tells her to see for herself.

Supervisor: ""Fine, if you don't believe me then how about you come back here and show me where the contactless button is.""

The customer looks unsure.

Customer: ""Oh, no, that's ok.""

But my supervisor insists.

Supervisor: ""Well if you're certain you're right then you should have no problem coming back here and proving us wrong then, will you?""

The customer comes back uncertainly and looks at our till.

Supervisor: ""Well? Please show me where the contactless button is.""

Customer: ""I... I don't see it.""

My supervisor tries unsuccessfully to hide his big smug grin.

Supervisor: ""Do you believe me now?""

The customer gives him a dirty look but doesn't say anything. She just walks back to the other side of the counter and takes out her purse.

Customer: ""I guess I'll pay by card then.""

I finish the sale and the customer says thank you and leaves without looking me or my supervisor in the eye. My supervisor looks victorious.

Supervisor: ""Don't worry about her, she was just looking for an argument.""

He then walks off. He was definitely my favorite supervisor.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d0yno6,I spent over £200! What do you mean I can’t have this free?,"This just happened today- a busy Saturday.  I work at a supermarket and was on the tills as usual. 

I get told by my one of my colleagues to keep an eye out for the older man at the end of my till because he’d be seen eating food from the bakery while walking round the store. He was looking at the magazines while waiting and I could see him eating a donut. 

He was with his (what I presume) wife and had a small amount of groceries and 3 large boxes of gardening equipment. So I scan all this through and it comes up to around £230 or so. 
Sometimes, customers will pay for their items separately. So I assumed this and ask them to pay, but still no mention of the donut. He’s still chewing. 

At the end of the transaction, I asked him: “shall I put the donut through now” 

He was not happy to say the least. His tone completely changed and seemed very taken aback that I’d even dare ask him to pay! It went something along the lines of:

Customer: “I thought as I’ve spent so much in here I could have the donut” 

Me: “No, you still need to pay.” 

(Doesn’t say anything) 

Me: “is their anything else you’ve eaten” 

(He’s really not happy now lol)

C: “ no I haven’t been here for long *gestures at his shopping*  I’ve only had time to eat one. If I was here longer I would’ve had 12” 

No idea how he said that with a serious face. 

Anyway I’m fairly certain he had more that one as a couple of different people saw him eating and our bakery is at the opposite end of the store to our check outs.

Me: “ok, so that will be 29p”

He seems completely shocked that I’m actually charging him for it and storms off out of the store leaving his wife to pay. 

Later on, I get told he was grazing the grapes too.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d138ba,"""You're wrong!""","(TL;DR at the end) This guy is by far the rudest regular customer we have (not the most annoying though, that's a story for another time). He quite regularly tells his kids ""naw yer no having that, yer too fat!"" when they ask for a bar of chocolate. For reference, I work in a petrol station in the UK. The shop is quite small, and while I dont know the price of every item, I do know the price of some of our more popular items (coke, Pepsi etc.). 

So this guy comes in today, gets some milk, crisps, cereal, and a bar of chocolate. After the transaction is finished he forgot he wanted some diet coke. Normally he gets a 4-pack of cans, but we were all out so instead he got a 1.75L bottle. He bring it's up to the counter, I scan it, and that's where the fun starts

Me: ""thats £1.89 for that one""

Him: ""it said £1 on the shelf""

Me: ""thats for the 1.25 litre bottle, this one is 1.75 litre"" (I knew this because I get a 1.25L bottle each shift, plus the 1.75L bottles are price marked at £1.89 each or 2 for £3)

Him: ""oh ok""

He pays, and I start serving a customer that came in while he was paying. I see him walk over to the shelf where the large bottles are, looking intently at the labels. I finish serving the other customer, and the rude guy then pipes up ""you're wrong! It says here £1 for diet coke! Come here right now and I'll show you how you're wrong!"". Now, sometimes after a promotion finishes some of the labels get missed when we are changing the signage. However, the only promotion the 1.75L bottle has ever been on is the ""2 for £3"" promotion that's marked on the bottle, not £1. So I go over to where he is standing by the shelf to show him that it is him that's wrong. Now, on the shelves the 1.25L bottles are right next to the 1.75L bottles. So I can see how it would be confusing for someone with bad eyesight, or if they just aren't paying attention. But this guy is just plain arrogant. He points to the sign that says ""£1 Diet Coke/Coke Zero 1.25L"" and says ""see its £1!"". I say ""aye, for the 1.25 litre bottle, as it says there"" then point to the label for the 1.75L ""and that's the 1.75 litre, at £1.89"". He then starts ranting about how it's ""false advertising"" to have the 1.25L next to the 1.75L and that I need to ""move those right now!"". I simply tell him that I am not permitted to rearrange the shelves without approval from the manager, who has to get approval from the merchandisers in an office down in England. After some more ranting, he leaves, shouting ""get them told!"" as he walks out the door.

t3_d14cot,Return falling apart,"I work at a grocery store. We also sell other stuff sometimes like clothes or plants.
At one day a women came to me and explains that the poinsettia plant that she bought a few hours ago has been falling apart. She told me that it happened while the car drive. She showed me the bill and said she wanted to have a new plant. I was a bit curious but since we are very margin I told her that it is no problem and she can have a new one. Then I asked her to give me the old one. 
""I don't have it with me"" 
was her answer. I asked her why and she said that she saw no need to bring it because it has fallen apart so much it's just leads and twigs and there was nothing left to bring.
And when I explained to here that she can't return/chance something without the item and that she at leas could have brought the flower pot with her, she got really angry and loud. It took a long discussion till she finally gave up and left the store. m
Margin or not, I wonder how people (or at least this lady) can expect to get a new Item without the old one.

The store I work at is very unique compared to the other stores, but we are also a bit more expensive than the rest of the thrift stores in a 2 or 3 hour radius. 

This customer stood at the till complaining the 3 shirts i was ringing in were double the price of other thrift stores. I said well yes but we are independent we are not a chain and we also are very different than the other stores. 

Why buy items that you don't really need but just want if you aren't happy about the price. I get that for some $7 a tee shirt is too much, however don't buy it then? She did not appear to be in any particular need for clothing. She was very well dressed. There is an event in our town today that brought tourists, I am pretty sure she was an out of towner.

t3_d0mpwr,"""I Found Corporate's Number!""","Hey guys! This just happened an hour ago, and I'm still steamy about it! English is my first language; I'm on mobile; and I'm on my break.

As you guys should know, I'm black and work in a big department store, specifically in the shoe department. In my department store, our return policy for one particular type of shoe have a limited return policy, meaning that it can be returned within a certain amount of days. We tell this to every customer who buys these shoes, and it's on the back of the receipt as well, and we are not allowed to make any exceptions.

Anyway, I just clocked in and am starting to get to work. This woman, an older black lady (who will be called Rude Customer), came over to me with a box in her arms. I approached her.

ME: Good afternoon. Do you have a return?

RUDE CUSTOMER: Yes ma'am.

We went to my register and began to start the return. Immediately, I get a notification on my computer saying that it was past the last possible return day for the shoes. Oh great.

ME: I'm sorry, ma'am, but I cannot return these shoes because it's past (insert amount of days), and I cannot do a return past it.

Insert the ""rude"" part of her title.

RUDE CUSTOMER: No, honey. I didn't hear anything about that. You can do whatever you need to do. I just need to return them.

ME: I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do.

RUDE CUSTOMER: Call your manager.

Insert eye roll. I get the phone and call my manager. My manager came over and immediately took over the transaction. I wondered off just so I can calm down, but I heard some brief raised voices and saw the lady storm off. Whatever. I continued with my day. Shortly after I get a different customer, who was really sweet, her pair of shoes, my coworker came over to me, looking a bit angry, with the phone to her ear.

COWORKER: Hey OP. That lady came back and told me to tell you, ""Tell that black girl to tell whoever she called that I found corporate's number and I'm gonna call them!""

I couldn't help but laugh. That ""corporate's number"" was going to lead her straight to my manager, who is going to tell her the exact same thing.

There are many typed of ways to get said coupons, mailers, text,email, and even app. We mostly get old ladies and I have yet to experience a really rude customer. An old lady comes to the register and she pulls out some coupons. I instantly noticed they are long expired and point this out. She says she dosen't get them in the mail anymore and asked if theres anything I could do. I inform her that she can sign up for mailers again through the internet and also suggest  email or text. She very annoyed says she does not have internet. I just keep bagging her stuff when she takes a breath and in a very polite but annoyed tone goes ""I'm sorry but this is discrimination."" I just  smile and do my usual ""thank you for stopping by have a lovely day"" and she leaves very annoyed and mumbling.

The thing is, so many people her age and older have iPhones with the app. They don't fully understand how it works but they're trying and I happily help them. Is it discriminatory that technology is changing and shes not adapting? I don't believe so but I feel this could actually be an interesting conversation?

t3_d0oyno,Woman moves sales sign in a sad attempt to save a couple bucks,"This is another story from my time working as a sales associate at a store going through liquidation during the summer of 2019.

If you’ve ever worked or been in a store during liquidation, you’ve definitely noticed the crazy sales that go on. In this store we increased the percentages every week on Thursday. I usually got scheduled before opening along with a couple other coworkers to change all the sale signs that needed to be changed. During the week this story takes place I changed the signs for small appliances, bedding, most of the women’s clothes, and some kids. It was extremely hard to keep up with all the changes, but we did our best and if one worker didn’t know the sale, another would, so 99% of the time we could figure out the actual sale price instead of relying on customers. If I changed any of the signs, I was able to remember the sales for that section easily and never made a mistake with those.

A lady comes to the register with an iron. This was part of small appliances and during this week they were 40% off. I made sure it rang up for that and went to continue the transaction.

Customer- “This is supposed to be 50% off.”

Me- “No ma’am, all small appliances are 40%. Are you sure you got this from the correct shelf?”

Customer-“ Yes. there was a 50% off sign beside this and all the other irons were beside it. You need to honor that price.”

Me- “I’m sorry but I can’t change the sale. I know these are 40% off.”

Customer- “No it says 50%! You have to sell it to me for that!”

She makes me walk over to where they are. I look and I see a 50% off sign just sitting on the shelf. I was the one who changed the signs in this sections so every sign was supposed to be taped up onto the shelves. Now what was 50% was the bedding right beside small appliances. I pick it up and say, “This doesn’t belong here. It looks like it fell from over here --*I point to bedding--* and someone just set it here. I’m sorry ma’am.”

I start walking back to the counter to put the sign up while I work until I can tape it back where it was supposed to be with her snapping at me the whole way.

Customer- “You have to sell me the iron for 50% since someone put the sign there! You need to honor this!”

Me- “I can’t. Every other sign in that section says 40%, and this sign was obviously just set there.”

Customer- “You people need to get better at your job then instead of putting the wrong signs everywhere! This is false advertisement! I’m going to go get your manager!”

After she left I went to go take the sign back, and when I got a closer look, I realized the sign had actually been *ripped off* the bedding shelves and put by the iron the lady was trying to buy. I put two and two together and realized this crazy woman had tried to trick me into selling her the iron for cheap by switching signs around.

Never saw my manager that day, and never saw her in the store again.

So many people tried things like this while I was working, but none of them had ever actually switched signs around. It was actually pretty entertaining once I realized what the lady had done.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d0rr82,Apparently we are horrible,"Ok. So another story from my job. 
I work in a retail store that sells home decor and furniture. Anytime we have to order something for a customer sent to our store, it comes with our freight truck. We have a policy of calling all customer orders the day they get there, so that they can hopefully come get them ASAP. So, we got freight on a Monday. I sat with my freight manager as she called all her orders and left voicemails. 

The next day, my associate gets a call asking of a customer order has come in. She checks our system and the stockroom and informed the customer that it was here. 

This customer lost it over the phone. She started yelling about how she never received a call or email. How it should be our policy to call our customers when their orders arrive. And this was horrible customer service. 

My associate apologizes to the customer, thinking she got missed in the call list. And then after hanging up brings this to my attention. I ask her what the order name is. I knew for a fact that this lady had been called AND emailed. So I just figured the lady needed to yell at someone and let it go. 

Two days later, my associate comes to the back, saying this customer claims her two chairs are missing legs. I tell my associate to tell the customer that they are in the zipper compartment under the chair, along with all the hardware and tools needed. A few minutes pass and my associate calls me to the register for an issue. I come up and ask the customer what is going on. She starts going off on me about how she borrowed a truck to come get these chairs and got them home and there are no legs. And NOW she's being told that they are under the chairs.


I ask her why she didn't just call us when she thought the legs were missing. 


That apparently made her more angry. She started yelling about how we weren't doing our jobs by telling everyone where the legs are. And it's ridiculous that she had to borrow a truck to bring them back. So she's just done with them. Return them. We were horrible.

It took everything I had to just respond with, ""ok."" And process the return. 


Just as a side note, we tell our customers when they order that there may be some assembly required. The instructions are normally very clear but if they have issues they can call us. And we have even put the items together when requested. But this lady didn't even try at all. These chairs weren't even out of the boxes.",TalesFromRetail

C- hi, I bought this item earlier today but I found the same one at another store for cheaper so I bought that one and I want to return this one. 

J looks at the item which has clearly been opened and gestures to the multiple policy signs in that items location 

J- I'm sorry we don't offer refunds on these items once they have been opened, but I can give you credit or exchange it for you. 

C- what do you mean? I just bought it a few hours ago. 

J reiterates the policy 

C- is (our managers name) here? I've never had a problem before. 

J- no she isn't, this is a new policy. But if you have an issue with our policies you can call customer service. 

C- fine 

And she leaves the store. She them returns maybe 20 min later saying she can't find the customer service number can we give it to her. J finds the number and starts to write it down when this woman starts going off on her. 

C- you know this is really inconvenient for me. I have spent hundreds of dollars here and I don't need two of the same thing! 

J- I'm sorry you bought two but I don't make the policies. 

C- how would you like it if someone refused to give you a refund like this!? What's your name?

J says her name 

C- oh of course you're a ""J""..

I'm next to her thinking like I don't know what ""J"" screwed your husband but chill.. 

J- look here is the phone number. You have no reason to be personally attacking me. You have the number you can leave now.

Customer storms out. An hour or two later we get a call from home office and they want to speak to J, basically ask what happened. So she tells them what happened, in the mean time they are having the customer e-mail a picture of the item to them so they can determine if it was opened or not. Apparently she couldn't figure out how to send the picture so we are told to just refund the item. Luckily neither of us was there when she came back because according to the co-worker who DID return it for her, when she came in she didn't bring the receipt and when she told her our system literally won't allow a cash refund without the original receipt so of course she was huffing and puffing about how this store was out of the way for her and all this crap.

t3_d0qkof,Getting Yelled At Because I Won't Break Store Policy,"Background: I work at the customer service desk in a membership-based warehouse chain. I've been working at the store for two years, and at customer service since the beginning of the summer.

Every so often, our store mails out flyers that people can bring in to either 1) Get a free 3-month trial membership or 2) Get a full-year membership for less than half the normal cost. The free trial is for new customers only (and says as much in large text right under the offer), but the discounted offer is good for anyone, even to renew an existing account.

The other night, a woman (W) and her husband (H) walk up to me with the flyer in hand:

&gt;W: Hi, I'd like to use this free 3 month offer, please.

&gt;Me: Have you ever had a membership with us before?

&gt;W: Yup, I have, but it expired.

&gt;Me: Unfortunately, as it says on the flyer, the trial is only good for new members. If you'd like to renew your existing account, I can process the renewal at the discounted rate of $25 (rather than the regular $55).

&gt;W: (getting annoyed) Well they've done it for me before.

&gt;Me: Even if I was allowed to per corporate policy, our computer system won't allow me to process a trial if you've already been a member.

*This is actually true. If we try to open a trial membership, the computer system will search for a matching driver's license in existing accounts and block the new account from being opened.*

&gt;W: (Pissed off) FINE. WELL MY HUSBAND HAS NEVER BEEN A MEMBER SO I'LL HAVE HIM DO IT.

Before I can say anything, she yells:

&gt;W: [HUSBAND]! COME OVER HERE!

H comes over, looking confused.

W gestures at me.

&gt;W: HE'S TRYING TO TELL ME THAT SINCE WE'VE BEEN MEMBERS BEFORE, WE CAN'T DO A TRIAL. SO OPEN UP A CARD IN YOUR NAME.

We technically can't refuse this, so I ask for his ID. Valid identification is required no matter what.

&gt;H: Oh... I don't have my wallet with me.

&gt;Me: Without some form of ID I won't be able to process a new account at all. I can still renew your existing account, though.

&gt;W: WILL I STILL BE ABLE TO SHOP IF I DON'T RENEW?

&gt;Me: Yes, but you'll be charged a 20% surcharge for shopping as a non-member.

t3_d0om7j,I'm gonna sue you guys for damages.,"**Just for some background:**

I work in an awards/trophy/gift shop and most of our business comes from engraving items and awards. The only people that work there are me and my boss who owns the place. I do all the engraving with our laser machine and sometimes help run the shop if my boss needs to go out of town.

My boss had left the shop for two weeks because she had some family visiting at home and I was left running the shop.

**And now for my new favorite customer to come in:**

One fine Tuesday, this guy comes to the shop with an engraving order. I got the details and essentially this guy owned a funeral-type business and he needed a small tag engraved with a name and dates. The whole time the guy is in my shop he is acting a bit odd  eg. staring at another guy who was waiting to be helped and talking about how my predecessor was ""something"" (my predecessor is actually a very nice guy thank you), and walking into the neighboring business after he left just to eat their free candy.

After the whole transaction was complete I told the guy that he could pay when he picked it up and that I could have the order done *""either this week or in the first half of next week""* due to us having other orders\*\*.\*\* The guy left without so much as a farewell.

Now, I had talked to my boss about the order because she briefly came in the next day to handle a couple things and noticed the order. Apparently this guy comes in every few months with these orders and always gives trouble and is a bit of an oddball so of course she warned me about him.

Fast forward a few days to Friday in the morning. I was chilling out at home for a couple hours before I had to head in to work. I then got a call from my boss saying that she received a call from the same guy who is apparently at our store before we open and called her because he hadn't received his order. The guy said that the funeral service the tag was needed for was at Noon that day and that he needed the tag before then. My boss just wanted me to tell her where the file was for it and then proceeded to go into the shop and engrave the tag. The guy (understandably) hadn't waited around for my boss to come in and engrave the tag and had said over the phone that he would be in when it was ready. Apparently the guy also told my boss that I had said I could get the order done in two days (this is second hand from my boss). I KNOW I never said that because I **NEVER** give an exact amount of days for me to complete an order if I don't need to (because I cant always tell how long every single order is going to take).

My boss got the tag done, called him, and waited around until 11:30 for him to come pick up the tag.

**He didn't.**

So later on I came in, opened up the shop (about 11:45 since the store was opening late while my boss was gone) and proceeded to have a very quiet day until about 3:45-4:00PM when you know who comes in. The absolute first thing the guy tells me is that he's never doing business with us again (ok, whatever dude) and then asks how much the order is. While I'm entering the order into our register, the guy says ""I'm gonna sue you guys for damages."" and follows it up with ""I told the family that they didn't get their tag because of you guys so you'll be hearing from them too!""

The guy paid for the order and left and I of course immediately ran to the back and busted my gut laughing. I felt obligated to call my boss because we had just been threatened with a lawsuit but she just laughed it off as well.

I want you all to understand, if this guy would have said he needed the tag by Friday at Noon I would have gotten it done the day before but **he didn't.**

**TL;DR** A pretty weird guy comes in to my shop, order a funeral tag, gets mad that it isn't done in two days (despite me telling him it might not be until next week), and threatens to sue my work over it.",TalesFromRetail

""Wait. That isn't right. Isn't it supposed to be on sale for $3?"" She asks. ""I'm not sure, let me go check the tag where it was."" She has the wrong brand, of course. I explain this to her and she gets extremely irritated. I then pick up a store sale ad next to the register and show her the specific sale she's looking for. ""See, you picked the store brand tub. The one that's on sale is the Kraft squeezable tube."" She then proceeds to demand that I give her the discount, and I politely told her I couldn't do that since the item she got wasn't on sale. ""It was with the other mayo, I should still get the discount!"" She yelled. By this time, she's held up the line and 15 people are behind her while my manager had to take them on the other register. She gets irate and screams ""Can't you f_cking read? It's clearly on sale!!"" At this point I'm about to lose it on her, so I very curtly tell her ""You have a tub of *store brand*. The one that's on sale is *Kraft brand*. In other words, your item is *not on sale*. ""

I informed her and she asked if it was ok to run and get a new one. I said sure, it wasn't far and she had a fair amount of things I needed to ring up. I was only about hallway through when another woman comes up to my register.

We'll call her Miss Impatient.

Miss Impatient looks at the merchandise on the belt, looks at me, looks at the cart I'm putting stuff into, says ""is there nobody for this cart?""

Silence. Ok. I finish ringing I tell her the total then ask ""Did you have a store loyalty card or any coupons?""

""I don't have time for this sh!t! I gotta catch my bus! Why did that lady have so much stuff? This isn't a grocery checkout."" (It's slightly separated from the other registers by the customer service desk)

Me as I'm handing her the receipt ""this isn't a limited item checkout so it's ok to bring a full cart over here""

Her ""well it shouldn't be, I'm going to call corporate and tell them that. I'm going to miss my bus now.""

She walked out. It's not the first time I've had someone tell me this register should be limited. It's just another thing that happened. I'm just baffled by her asking me, while I'm scanning items, if nobody was there for the transaction I was ringing up. Like lady, why the hell would I be ringing it up if nobody was buying it?",TalesFromRetail
t3_d0lhx7,I threw a customers shoes in the bin,"This story happened a couple of years go, while I was still an apprentice at the shoe company I work at. Now the store I worked at that time, had something called a clearance section. Basically all the shoes in that section were discontinued lines and were reduced to sell. However because of where that section is located in the store, shoes often get stolen and we usually only find out by finding a old pair of shoes shoved on the rack or left by stools, as the stock can't be monitored properly due to not being in the system anymore. 

Anyway so this story happened in the summer, which makes the shop incredibly busy. My manager tells to go get some stock from upstairs, as I go up I notice this girl with an older lady trying on shoes, between the kids and clearance section. I think nothing off it and go and get the stock, I return about 15 minutes later to find them gone and a pair of old dolly shoes on the floor, now at this point I do nothing, but I make a mental note to keep an eye on them. At that point I have no idea whether a customer is the just trying on shoes, a customer has bought shoes and just left their old ones as that did happen sometimes or someone had stole some shoes and walked out with the new ones and left the old ones.

So over the next 40 minutes( I know it was 40 as it took  about 25 minutes to put the stock out and someone else went up to get some more, which takes 10-15 minutes) I walk past the shoes 5-6 times as I go to get shoes from the stockroom for customers. The last few times I make a mental note to try to remember to do something with the shoes, as by that point I was sure they had been left there and the customer had left the store.

My colleague returned from the stock room and my manager asked me to go round and tidy the store the best I could, as usual I started at the back in the clearance section which always got trashed within 5 minutes after it getting tidied and it took me a good 5 minutes to get it somewhat presentable, i'm about to start on kids when I notice the dolly shoes again, still in the same place and untouched. I pick them up and ask all the customers around me if they owned the shoes, all said no, so I went and placed the dolly shoes by the till while I finished tidying the store.  I have had customers walk off before and leave their shoes while they tried on shoes, but they always kept an eye on the location and customers always came back when staff were by their shoes, so nothing happened to them. 

I finished tidying the store and went back to the till, the dolly shoes still went unclaimed. So I took them to the bin outside and threw them out. Now if this was a bag, we would have put it in the back, but because of the location of the shoes, the length they were and the fact that no one claimed them, made it safe to assume someone had left them there on purpose.  They were left there for well over an hour. I wish this was the end of it but it's not.

About 10 minutes after I'd thrown the shoes out, a lady comes to me and asks me, if I had seen the dolly shoes. Looking back I should have lied, but she caught me off guard. I told her that they had been thrown into the bin outside. That's when everything kicked off. I attempted to explain the situation, but she wouldn't let me get a word in edgeways. My manager took over the situation and never once did she blame me. However the family of the woman was with kept coming to verbally attack me, twisting my words saying that I never asked if someone owned the shoes and If I did I was too quiet, going as far to say they couldn't hear what I was saying to them at that moment. My manager cut in saying that they wouldn't of heard me if they were down by the till, but that they should have noticed the shoes when I placed them behind the till.

This didn't stop them from attacking me, in the end my manager had to send me to the stock room just so they'd leave me alone. I came back down and my manager was in the office talking to customer services, the family is standing outside. It isn't long until the woman comes back in and starts having another go at me, despite my manager handling the situation.  My colleague went to get my manager and they both came out. My manager said customer services had told her, we had to retrieve the shoes from the bin as that is what the family wanted, which we did. The family weren't happy and accused me of lying to them saying I said I threw them in the back bin and were soon back on the phone to customer services. 

They came back in and started attacking me again, saying that customers services had said they could have a free pair of shoes up to £10. Now that may not seem like an attack but it was the way they did it. I can't explain it. Anyway I say i'm not authorised to say anything and to talk to my manager, something they weren't happy about. My manager agrees to it as she's had a call from customer services to let her know. But the woman comes at me again saying, I've done harm to her granddaughter. 

My manager walks off the floor and while she's off the floor the father of the girl, tries to remove a security tag from the shoes she's chosen over the counter. My colleague stops him and places the shoes under the till, stating that my manager has to deal with it. They fight back saying they are entitled to a free pair of shoes and that's what they were doing. However until it is processed through the till, it's still classed as theft.

Any way it all gets processed and they begin to start on me again, stating that the grandma, worked in another retail store and she would have been fired, if she had from customers belongings out. My manager sends me on my lunch to get me away from them again.

When I come back from my lunch, my manager says the family lied to customer services. Apparently they told customer services that the shoes I threw out, were worth £50 and were branded, when I fact they were only worth  £4 from the shop they bought them from and certainly weren't a high end brand. My manager happily sent the evidence to head office. She also deduced that the family were after a free pair of shoes from the start.

t3_d0g3l2,"Not a Bad story, but a cute one","Ok. Some background. I work in a world famous Bakery. We are know for our fruitcakes, but have a deli and Bakery line too (which is where I like to work). So My manager and I are talking behind the bakery line counter when this woman walks up. She thinks for a minute about what she wants then asks my manager what is in our double fudge chunk brownie. My manager replies with “A whole lotta goodness.” She laughs at this, and says that she is Diabetic and we are gonna make her sick with all the good looking items. She then asks what my manager’s favorite brownie is. “Pecan.” She says. The woman was sweet the whole time and ends up getting the pecan. We package her up and she goes about her merry way. About half an hour goes by and she walks back in. She asks if she can speak with our manager, and we were all terrified. The manager asks if there was a problem, to which the woman said no, but wanted to tell us that the Brownie “knocked her on her ass.” She turned around and came back to the Bakery to tell us how good her Brownie was! She started taking a lot of free samples of our fruitcake. She explained that she had a lot of dogs in the car and was taking them for the dogs, I told her we have dog treats and can give her free ones for the pooches. She invites me outside to give them to the dogs. I go with her and was greeted by a mountain of puppies when the door was opened. I was swamped as I struggled to give treats to all of the doggos. The were miniature schnauzers and they were like, super excited.

t3_d0jc15,The Saga of the most obsessive scammer ever.,"So last week we had an elderly gentleman come up to the paint desk needing some help. I had just finished with someone else's order, and my coworker was still busy so I go up to help him. He says something along the lines of

&gt;Are you the best paint mixer here? No? I wanna talk to that older guy then

So I pass him onto my coworker, and he wants 2 gallons of deck stain in an ugly burnt orange color. Each can of stain costs about $45 for reference. Coworker makes it for him, and he goes 

&gt;I don't like this color can you make it darker

Wonderful, he's gonna be that guy while we're swamped. So for whatever God forsaken reason he doesn't care that I take over and darken it. While I'm doing it he keeps hollering

&gt;yeah make it darker, add some black to it! Yeah make it darker, add some brown and black to it!

And he keeps repeating himself. I didn't bother explaining that just adding that would ruin the orange color and make it like a muddy color, so I make it a richer version of the orange. He still wasn't satisfied. He then opens back up the book and points to a new color, and this one is a medium shade of brown. Now all the red flags are going off in my head.

So we have a wonderful little clearance rack full of ugly colors people brought back or didn't take with them in the first place. These paints are sometimes marked down almost 90%. This guy wanted to get these off said rack, and we knew it right then. But of course, we can't call him out on it.

So I make 2 more cans, and, guess what, he doesn't like these colors either. It's going on an hour I've been stuck with him now, and my manager walks up, I fill him in, and tell him I'm about to blow a gasket on this guy, so he takes over. Dude had been condescending the whole time and I had had it. (The stress of Labor Day weekend and all)

The guy then says he wants the darkest brown we have. My manager tells him to go to an actual paint shop because they'll have more color options. He leaves. I change the colors on his 4 gallons and put them on the clearance rack. But we weren't done with our friend, not by a long shot.

**Part 2**

A few hours later, the only folks left in the paint department were me and another coworker. My manager and the other coworker had gone home. And in walks the old man (it's around 7, we close at 10).

Shoot me.

&gt;Hey you still got those 4 gallons?

&gt;No sir I don't

(I do)

&gt;Did you sell them all that quickly?!?

&gt;Yes sir I did

&gt;Did you get full price???

&gt;Dunno, I was at lunch

*Speech 100*

A few minutes later he comes up to me again

&gt;Son I'm so sorry to be a pain in the ass but I need more stain mixed.

&gt;Did you go to Paint Shop

&gt;Yeah and they weren't worth nothing yadda yadda yadda

Guy then points at a reddish brown and wants 2 cans of it. I proceed to be an outright dick to him.

&gt;Do you want a red deck?

&gt;No

&gt;Well that color is red so don't get it

(In my defense, this color always comes out way red)

&gt;Well it looks alright in this book

Note that the samples in our books are garbage.

&gt;Well you're gonna hate it, that's not a dark brown. That's what you're wanting ain't it?

I point at our dark browns

&gt;Well that's almost black!

&gt;That's our only options

I proceed to spend almost a whole hour dealing with him AGAIN. He finally picks out a medium brown. I help with another order for maybe 5 minutes, come back to him and double check on the color. He's sure.

&gt;Alright I'll just make a quart first just to make sure you like it!

&gt;OH NONONONO I don't want y'all to have to waste stain for me!

&gt;Oh no sir it's quite alright!

I make it, and what do you know he hates it. I tell him take it home and try it on his deck to make sure. I tell him it's $20 and he freaks out saying he ain't paying that to test and to make him 2 gallons-despite hating said color. I grab my coworker, explain what's going on, and tell him I'm sorry, but I'm done with the guy, and if he approaches you good luck.

Another hour passes, I'm putting up stock, and my coworker sends him on his merry way, or so we hoped. He takes the 2 cans (This'll make 6 cans we've wasted on him) up to the register to pay and throws a fit.

So we were having a sale going with that stain. The sale was a rebate, and oh boy he didn't like that. Even though we told him that nearly a dozen times. He comes back ranting and raving. He walks out the door once he's done, and then comes right back and returns it, SCREAMING at the poor cashier and waving his card right in her face demanding his money back. A random other coworker didn't know what was going on and just to shut him up (this was while the refund was happening) said he'd just have them take the rebate off the paint price since he ""didn't know."" He freaks out at that too,

&gt;NO I WANT ALL MY DAMN MONEY ON MY DAMN CARD RIGHT NOW

So he gets his refund. Management at this point is sick of him, and tells me if he wants another paint mixed tell him no he's cut off. HELL YEAH.

So I get the stain back he just returned and mess the color up again. He comes storming over, picks up a 5 gallon of premixed stain, and leaves. He comes back not even a minute later and buys other random stuff like nothing happened.

It's 9:45. All our nights are ruined thanks to this one guy

**Part 3**

The guy comes in the following morning (I wasn't here for this) and I think at this point he knew the jig was up and wanting to throw a Hail Mary and see if he could pull off the scam. Oh and he returned his 5 gallon, claiming his ""painters didn't show up.""

He deals with my manager, and while he's thinking about a color my manager helps someone else, then comes back to the man, and it smells like he crapped his pants. And the guy just stood there like nothing happened. He talks to my manager for another 15-20 minutes, all the while the crap smell stuck around. He sends him to our nearby competition, and at last he leaves, defeated, dejected, and has yet to return. Later that day one of the higher ups tells us he's permanently cut off from getting paint mixed.

**Tl;dr** dude tries an obvious scam for 2 days, screws us out of nearly $300 of deck stain, and when he realizes the jig is up he screams at cashiers and craps his pants.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d0gitc,"""You're braindead""","I'm so happy I found this subreddit because I have lots of rude customer stories that I can contribute but this one takes the cake. I was working at the tills at the clothing store I worked at when the most cliche Karen waddled up with two friends and dumped their clothes on the counter. While I was processing the sale Karen repeatedly kept making rude backhanded comments to me while her friends just stayed quiet, I decided to just ignore her and tried to finish the sale as quickly as possible. When I was done she leaves and I was thankful I didn't have to deal with her anymore. Or so I thought.

One month later...

I was on tills again and shouted ""NEXT"" after finishing a sale. Two women walk up to the counter and one scoffs and says in a mocking tone ""It's next PLEASE!"". That's when I recognized her, the rude, self-entitled Karen that I had to deal with last month. I just stayed quiet and started processing the sale. Again I had to put up with her rude, backhanded comments and remarks throughout the whole sale. I thought it couldn't get much worse but boy was I wrong. When it was time to pay she hands me a one4all card (this is a gift card that is valid in most stores in my country. I scan it and it came up insufficient funds and my face drops because I know she is going to shoot the messenger.

Me: ""There are not enough funds on the card to make the transaction.""

Karen: sigh ""Well how much is on it?""

Me: ""I don't know it just says that there's not enough, it doesn't say an amount.""

Karen puts on a tone that makes it sound like she was talking to a five-year-old.

Karen: ""Well can't you check?!!""

Me: ""No sorry, we can't do that here, you'll have to check on the website.""

Karen: scoffs ""This is ridiculous. Fine, never mind, I'll pay by cash.""

She snatches the gift card from my hand and takes out her purse and turns it upside down and a stream of change and notes spill all across the counter. She then gives me a look that says ""What are you waiting for?"" I was tired from my long shift and Karen was making me stressed so I wasn't really thinking, I just wanted the sale to be over, so I took a note and opened the till, the entire time Karen is watching me like a hawk, looking from me to the money in my hand and back up at me. I take out the change and try to hand it to Karen. She looks at my hand in disgust.

Karen: ""What the hell is that?""

Me: ""Um... your change.""

Karen: ""Yeah exactly, why do I have change, couldn't you have just counted out the exact amount from this.""

She gestures at the hundreds of coins on the counter.

Me: ""Oh sorry, I didn't think-""

Karen: ""Yeah exactly, you didn't think.""

Normally when something like this happens we are supposed to just get the supervisor to open the till and redo the cash part of the transaction and it would be an easy fix to the problem but I wasn't about to do her any favors. I started to wonder why she never said anything when I picked up the note in the first place because she very clearly saw me, but then I realized that she wanted me to make this mistake. She wanted me to make this mistake so she could treat me like shit and justify it in her delusional mind.

Me: ""Well you were watching me process the sale and you never said anything.""

Karen looks shocked I would dare talk back to her.

Karen: ""I DIDN'T THINK I HAD TO TELL YOU, YOU SHOULD'VE KNOWN!!!""

I go quite, I knew if I said anything I would make things worse and I hoped that now she had her change she would just leave. But I had no such luck.

Karen: ""Ugh, your braindead.""

Both me and the friend she had with her was shocked. She had been incredibly rude to me up to this point but this was the first time she had blatantly insulted me. She starts repeating this insult at me over and over.

Karen: ""You're so braindead.""

She turns to her friend and says ""He's braindead isn't he"" but the friend just stayed quiet and gives her a look that seemed to say ""Don't drag me into this."" To be honest I think her friend felt bad for me. I was pissed off, I sat there debating whether or not it would be worth it if I gave her a taste of her own medicine, but in the end, I decided she wasn't worth it, this was my very first job and I didn't want to get fired from it. She started clearing the change off the counter into her purse, and while she did it she continued to mutter about how braindead I was. When she was finished she grabbed her shopping and stormed off and I haven't seen her since.",TalesFromRetail

Instead of going to the upper level to look for a salesperson there, she spotted a camera, started waving the merchandise she wished to purchase above her head, and walked out into the mall.

t3_d09md4,Provided excellent customer service and a big screw you.,"So a few years back I had a seasonal job with a store.  I had been told I was going to be hired on permanently, but they gave me some excuse as to why I wasn't able to be hired two days before my seasonal job ended.  I was disappointed because I loved this job, but I figured I'd be eligible for rehire so it wasn't too bad. Looking back, I corrected the assistant manager twice (price check on seasonal clearance, backed up by the GM, I was legit right) and then suddenly wasn't going to be permanent so I know why it happened.

So I show up for my last shift, even though I was screwed over, because I'm a nice person and didn't want to leave them short handed.  I was put on the register for my last shift and had to call with increasing frequency for back up on registers because of increase in customers.  Every single time I do, the assistant manager and her little lackey (we'll call them A and B) get on the radio and passive aggressively talk to each other about how I'm calling for backup AGAIN and they sure hope I don't take up too much of their time because they have SO MUCH to get done that day.  I let it slide off me because it was my last shift and I'll be damned if I let these two push me into walking out.  Still, it was highly annoying.  

Finally, with maybe an hour left in my shift, a lady came up and was buying about $30 worth of stuff.  She said she had a $20 bill and hadn't been able to get to the coin counting machines to get her change taken care of and would I mind counting out the rest in change?  Now, I'd just listened to yet another rendition from A and B about how much of an inconvenience it was to have to come help me and they needed to be able to finish their tasks that the GM assigned them, blah blah blah. I looked at my customer and said, ""Ma'am, why don't we count out all the change first and then take the rest out of the $20? Those change machines take a percentage and we're always happy to have change!"" It took me twenty minutes to count it all out. There was only about $6 in quarters and maybe another $5 in dimes, but I kept going until I used up as much of her change as possible. Every one of the coin spots was full to the top, plus a bunch extra tossed haphazardly in the extra spot off to the side.  B couldn't leave the other register the entire time because of customers and I got to out do them in passive aggressiveness right before leaving.  Left that place with a poo-eating grin and I've never gone back.

I'm on mobile, sorry for spacing.

This was probably my second day, and my first late shift, so I was a little nervous but determined to do well. I was the only cashier at the register because the manager was restocking items. Eventually, I one woman approaches my register and I smile and give my usual greeting.

Me: Hello ma'am! Are you ready to check out?

C: Yes, but I have one question.

Me: Of course, go ahead.

C: Are these really a dollar a piece?

She was talking about a large stack of folders she brought to the register. I checked them in the computer first, really not wanting to mess up when I was still new, and saw that it was the correct price.

Me: Yes Ma'am, those are each one dollar.

She smiles, so I went back to ringing up her items, thinking all was well.

C: That is RIDICULOUSLY expensive.

I was sort of taken aback by the way she said it, but I could kind of understand what she was talking about. She had a lot of them, so it added up to a bit of a high price, plus she had other things to check out as well. But the folders she was buying were the kind that were made to last. If she was buying those cheap plastic ones (which cost 25 cents) I would understand a dollar being ridiculously expensive.

Of course I wasn't going to SAY any of that. I just stopped smiling, put my head down and continued to ring up her items. I gave her the total, she paid and walked out.

t3_d02zbo,FOOLS! Why don't you sell your rival's products?,"A long time ago in a southern English village far, far away...


In my pre-university days back in the early 90s I worked weekends at a small supermarket whose name rhymed with Late Rose. I had many odd encounters while there (with both customers and my often 'eccentric' colleagues).


One sunny Saturday, a well-heeled gent approached me.


WHG: Excuse me. Where would I find the Tusko (our only local rival supermarket) crisps?


Me: Um... In Tusko, Sir.


WHG: What?? Haven't you got any in stock?


Me: I'm afraid not, Sir. The only place you can get Tusko own brand crisps is... well... Tusko.


WHG: (getting a tad fractious): That's utter rubbish. You can get them anywhere! And if you don't sell them, you should. They're far better than your own brand crisps (SPOILER they were the same crisps in different bags but you don't tell customers that).


Me: I assure you, Sir, shops' own brand crisps or, indeed, any own brand goods are only ever sold in those actual shops. 


WHG: (leans up close to my face and stage whispers) You just don't want a rival making a profit in your shop. It's PATHETIC and that's why Tusko will put you out of business: if you don't start selling Tusko products, everyone will go to Tusko to get them. Then you'll be sorry!

t3_d0bo7k,How dare you care about the safety of customers!,"So I work at a store that sells, buys, trades and repairs arcade machines. We also deal in pool tables and such.

One day, I notice that a cocktail style arcade machine, has the door covering the electronics missing, while the machine was on the sales floor. Well, that kind of looks a bit dumpy to have that where customers can see it, with no one actively working on it or signs of work-in-progress (like a tool box or manual near it). But it gets even better. The missing door, was right where a player's knees would be, if sitting in front of the game to play it. The high voltage parts of the machine were exposed, and it was *plugged in while the store was open*.

This really looked like a recipe for disaster, doubly so since we get children in the store at times, so I went over and was about to unplug the machine. Of the two coworkers present at the time, they both flipped out when they saw what I was going to do, both of whom insisted ""It's fine"" and actually sounded angry at me. Okay, whatever. So, instead I opt to move the machine in such a way that the opening is more obstructed. But no, it absolutely *had* to be facing *that* direction, and *had* to stay plugged in. One of the guys was about to go build a new cover for it in the back, but why couldn't he just tell me that in the first place?

One of those people pulled a similarly boneheaded move, basically bypassing a main fuse to try and get a machine running. (the fuse holder was broken and it wasn't a type that is very common, but surely a substitute could be wired in so that there would still be protection?) For those who didn't study electronics, the whole point of a fuse is so that a fire doesn't start if there's a fault in a circuit (or in this case, the skee-ball machine) so wiring around it is a good way to burn down the building.

I had a rather strongly worded conversation with him about how dangerous that is, and also the lesser possibility of simply rendering the machine a total loss, which would still be a good way for him to lose his job. I also suggested that he at least know where the fire extinguisher is, since anyone willing to pull a stunt like that will probably end up needing it. That, or maybe just a good pair of running shoes.

I didn't tell my boss about that thing with the fuse, since I figured maybe the employee could learn from this, and I thought that might be a 0-tolerance instant dismissal for that guy if the boss found out, and maybe I could also play the ""I didn't tell the boss about (thing that would have cost you your job)"" card to get him to listen if I need to steer him away from other stupidity. However, I do intend to tell my boss how two different people both got mad at me, for unplugging things that might electrocute someone.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d0bibs,"Ah, memories...","Hey there everyone, this is not only my first post to this sub, but I'm also on mobile! So, ah... Please bear with me here! 

So, last year I got hired at a popular retailer and began training as a standard brand associate, later to be a cashier. I've got a lot of fun stories from my days as a trainie and before getting my leadership position, but I think it's appropriate to start with my first funny experience as a cashier. Mind you, this was as I was being trained on cashwrap, and that this is my first job-- I was so confused xD (Note: I find this funny, because of how awkward it was.)

So, let's cut to the chase! 

Some time in July, 2018....
There I was, getting some live training in on one of our less busy days during back to school season. I was at a point where I didn't have a customer in line, and was next to a colleague in case I have any questions. Well, the phone began to ring, and a customer was in the line with a rather large transaction ahead-- I was instructed to answer the phone. (I am me, the caller is C)

I was not trained for this!

Me: ""Hello, thank you for calling companyname, this is me.""

C: ""Hellooo.""

*A second of awkward silence.*

C: ""Right, ah. So.. This is a bit of an embarrassing question.""

Me, immediately concerned about what was about to be asked: ""Hm?""

C: ""Does your companyname location have... uh. Those.. Plastic... Nipple covers?""

Okay, I'll be honest, I was oblivious to what she was trying to describe. Like, I've been to Vegas before, I've seen what she's describing, but that didn't come to mind.

Me: ""Uhm.. One second, lemme ask."" I put her on hold, and walked up to my colleague, who was still helping the customer with the large transaction (It was like.. ~$250 in jeans so far). ""So, Co-worker, the customer on the line wants to know if we have..."" I had to take a minute to recall her description. ""..Plastic.. uh. Covers."" 

CW: ""..Huh?""

Me: ""Plastic... Nipple covers?""

CW, trying not to laugh as the customer did: ""No, we don't carry pasties.""

Me, probably red-faced because I just said nipple at my new workplace: ""Okaythanks!"" I spoke quickly to get OUT of the situation. I picked up the phone.

""Ah, yes. Thank you for holding, ma'am. No, we do not carry those.""

C: ""Okay, thank you."" Click.

Guys I was so nervous to answer the phone from that point forward, now I just call for a stock check on line one instead of checking myself. Looking back on it, I really question how I didn't know what the heck a pastie was. And yes, my co-worker and I had a laugh about it afterwards. I'll never live that down. What makes it better is how she's old enough for me to be her son.

t3_d02pr4,Woman gets made because we honored a sale price,"On mobile so sorry if format sucks. Note this happened to my co-worker not me. 

At the store I work at if we have a sale going on but we don't have a product you are looking for then we can write you a raincheck and when the product comes in we call you and you can come in, present your raincheck slip and receive the item for that sale price. An important thing to note is that it is written clearly on the slip that it expires 30 days from the date issued. 

C- customer 
E- co-worker
 
Now, C comes in and presents a rain check to E. She comes over to me (in the back on a break) and says that she brought it in and it's well past expired what should she do.  Our manager is on vacation so she doesn't want to call and bother her and ask if she should accept it anyways so I tell her it's expired so she should not give her the sale but she can override it if she wants to. I come out with her at this point. 

E- okay so this offer is expired but I will give it to you this time. 

C- it's not my fault you guys never called me! 

E- i understand, that's why i-

C- where is (our managers name)

E- she is not here

C- who is in the back?

E- no one 

C- this is ridiculous I'll be calling customer service I shouldn't be punished because no one called me to tell me it's in! 

At this point she is drawing attention from other customers and she storms off. As she is walking out E shouts ""HAVE A NICE DAY!"" She is quite a loud and outspoken person so it had a bit of 'tude to it but it was nice for her. 

THIS WOMAM COMES BACK IN THE STORE just to reiterate that she will be contacting our superiors. E just said okay and we all had a giggle about it later cuz like.. We were going to give her the sale price. Some people are just crazy I guess!

UPDATE: she came back in and was talking to another co-worker that she is apparently all buddy buddy with saying she was terrorized by an employee. She said she was treated like a common criminal because she wanted this product and that she was ostrisized in front of a store full of people. She tells my co-worker that the employee was very rude and needs to be fired and that we were laughing at her. Then she says she walked out because ""I didn't want it anymore if she was gonna treat me like a criminal"" 
here is what SHE said happened (from what I could eavesdrop) 

C- I have a raincheck and no one has called me

E- sorry this is expired but I'll give it to you this time 

C- well no one called me so it's not my fault I shouldn't be punished

*walks out*
*walks back in*

E- change your mind?

C- no I just wanted to say you are very rude

E- *laughs in her face*

And during this my co-worker is all like ""Oh my gosh that's terrible I'm so sorry"" ect ect.

t3_czxt0a,Stupid questions don’t always come from customers.,"This is short, but puzzling to me. Makes me laugh actually. 
I’m training a new cashier and she’s, well, not the brightest. 
I have to show her how to do all of her cashiering duties each shift we work together, it’s like she comes back each day with no memory of working the days and now weeks prior. 

But this question just blew me away. 

Our freight day is generally the same as any typical retail store. A truck comes in early in the morning, delivers hundreds of totes of our products, and we stock them. 
Simple? Well, I guess after this it’s not. Haha

So I am training her (again) on how to use the scanner to show where product locations and positions are and she holds her hand up to ask a question. 
I pause and she simply asks “so this stuff is just what’s left at the register that customers didn’t want?”
I really had to pause and take a deep breath to not laugh out loud. 
Mind you as she asks this as one of the other cashiers is bringing up 8 totes, from the back, off the truck she saw earlier. 
To add to the 20 stacked around us in different aisles. 
I was perfectly pleasant (using my “nice” voice as my kids call it) and simply said
 “no, this is our order from the warehouse for the week, every week we restock the shelves based off what was purchased previously.”

It’s mind boggling the things she just does not notice. This may sound mean, or harsh, but trust me there are so many other bizarre questions coming from this lady daily. It’s really taken, and taught me, more patience. 

Makes you wonder how she’s made it through 50+ years of life though.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d0507d,1 to 10 items only!,"I work in a grocery store in Canada. If you guys ever worked in the express lane other than customer service you get the most rudest/craziest customers.

One day I had a young man bring a bunch of celeries to my express lane. I told them its only 1-10 items. They told me that because its all the same item its all considered 1 item?? He then proceeds to tell me he has 30 celeries.

**Cast: Me** \- Me // **VM**\- Vegetable man

VM: \*Places a lot of celeries on my express counter\*

Me: Excuse me sir, this lane is only 1-10 items.

VM: Its all the same item! Just type in 30.

Me: Sir no. One celery is one item. I need to count them all. Please go to the next cash register.

VM: I don't see what the problem is.  Just type in 30 celeries!! I ain't moving.

We argue and I try to explain but he just doesn't budge. The customer behind him just told me to finish his transaction (Thanks dude).

I proceed to count every celery. While I was counting he was just dancing a little to his airpods. He did not have 30 celeries instead he has **33**. I was so mad but keep my cool.

Me: Your total is $xx.xx.

VM: \*Taps his card\*

Me: \*gives receipt. I tell him bags are free and I continue with the next customer.\*

VM: Excuse me aren't you gonna bag my stuff?

Me: Sir you need to bag your own stuff.

t3_d04kxk,Tantrum over fish breading,"I recently started working at a slightly lower end type grocery store and like most retail, I get bratty customers often. This particular woman comes to my register and I ask her how shes doing and she doesn't even look up when she responds ""Horrible."" I'm quite surprised by this but stammer out ""I'm sorry-"" She cuts me off ""I can't find ______ brand fish breading! You guys dont sell it! I've searched this ENTIRE store!"" I point her towards the correct area. She walks down the correct aisle and walks out not even 3 seconds later before cutting in front of other customers to complain again that it's not there. My manager rushes over to assist and she gives her the same rant and tells her to go to same aisle I told her it was in. She then puts all of her groceries on the belt, ""trapping"" the other customers behind her and says ""Go get it for me then!"" We both refuse since we have long lines and few employees. Finally the hero of the story, another customer gets out of line and gets her the breading. She then starts freaking out because we only had homestyle and beer bread. She wanted the original. She then asks the other lady who got it for her to pay for it. She refuses. Our main lady pays for her other groceries and then throws both boxes into the nice lady's cart before leaving. Funny thing is I've tried the homestyle kind and it was great. Her loss.",TalesFromRetail
t3_d01o51,Man gets mad at us over running out of mac and cheese.,"This is my first post here on this subreddit so please excuse my grammar.

Where I'm from there are about 3 grocery stores, one of which I work in the deli department, specifically the bistro part of the job. This is from when I was relatively new to my job and I was still being trained. I work the shift that evening to close shift so we usually have a large dinner rush around six o'clock.

So here's how this one night I had a particular customer who got upset about mac and cheese.

Here's the people involved: Me- Me, C- Customer, CW 1- Co-Worker, CW 2- Co-Worker and ""Manager""

Me- ""Hello sir, how may I help you?""

C- ""Yeah do you all have anymore mac and cheese?""

Me- ""Unfortunately another customer has just bought the last of the mac and cheese we had prepare, it will be about 30 minutes before we have more.""

C, slightly annoyed- ""You're telling me you don't have ANY in backup.""

Me- ""I'm sorry but we do not.""

CW 1, who just put the bag of macaroni in our steamer. ""Hey OP, is everything okay up here?""

C, irritated,- ""No, this guy is lying to me that you all ran out of mac and cheese.""

CW 1- ""I'm sorry sir, but OP is not lying, I sold the last of it less than five minutes ago.""

C- ""This is the worst service I've had since coming back from Vietnam, go get me your manager, you two are going to be in a lot of trouble.""

Since it was around 7pm and our managers generally only work in the morning, no manager was in the store.

CW 1, whispering,- ""OP, go get CW 2, and explain what is happening, he has the most seniority.""

I went and got CW 2 and explained and he said that he would defuse the situation

CW 2- ""Hello sir, what was the issue?""

C- ""Yes, these two are lying to me about not having mac and cheese.""

CW 2- ""Sir they are out but is there something I could give you discounted to make up for the trouble?""

C- ""I guess I'll take some fried chicken, and making sure the two working here are punished.""

CW 2 is a really nice old man so he says ""I'll have a chat with them after you are out of here.""

After the man leaves we all just have a laugh in the kitchen.

The customer got some discounted fried chicken and when he came back he bought half of the macaroni that just came out. I know it's not the shortest or most interesting story.

Thanks for sticking around, if you see any grammar issues feel free to let me know so I know where I can improve upon if I ever need to post again.

t3_cznavj,They called my regular a b**** :(,"I work at a very small, busy store. We sell bags for 10¢, and have boxes if you forget to bring reusable bags. Some people being in extra plastic bags they've stashed at home, and give them to us to disperse. Everything here is insanely cheap. Full cart of groceries for $30, cheap. 

We got absolutely slammed after the holiday weekend, as we expected. It got so busy that we ran out of extra bags AND boxes, which usually doesn't happen. 

I had an entire family over 250lbs each, all adults. They stank. They were mean.

It came time to pay and pack their items, but when I mentioned that we ran out of free bags and boxes, but have 10¢ bags available, the lady who did all the talking got pissed. ""I'll see about that!"" as she stormed off to ask stockers. 

In the meantime, one of the guys with her just asked for a few of the 10¢ bags and we packed up. She came back, rammed into my regular, and started barking at the guy who got the bags. She complained about how long the wait was (it's not, at all, she just took forever). 

My regular went ""those people are rude"" as I rang her up. I smiled real big said ""have a nice day!"" She knew they ticked me off, too, and said ""good luck!""

Then they called her a bitch. Nice. 

I turned back around to see all the dog food I was pricing, in their cart. ""Hey you didn't pay for that"". ""Oh. Thought we did."" as they reluctantly have it back. 

I'll give them the benefit of the doubt here, but they didn't even stop by the pet section. No way they thought they had paid for it.

t3_czt082,You can't shop at our store if you're banned,"So I work at a large supercenter, which is part of a chain, and we do many online orders for customers. 

When we look up there name it tells us of the order is on it's way, ready to be picked, or if it was dispensed. I'm still fairly new to this area and usually need help if there is a big problem. 

Yesterday, these two women came in and said they were there to pick up an order.

Me: ""Who are you picking up for?""

Girl: ""Jane Smith""

Me: ""I'm sorry, I don't see an order under that name, is it under a different name?""

G: ""Maybe Lisa Smith?""

M: ""Are you sure it's at our store and not one in the town over?""

Other woman: ""It should be at this store, they live in this town. It better not be there. I don't want to drive there.""

I tried that name too and nothing was showing up. The other woman started to get irritated and said that the same they had problems last time too.

M: ""Do you have the order number? Or the conformation email?""

Other woman: ""No. Her mother ordered it, she has gotten multiple emails saying it's here and it wasn't last time.""

I apologized to her around the same time my coworker came over and gave her a number to call customer service. 

Then earlier today I got a phone call from the woman who ordered.

JS: ""I wanna know if my order is there. I keep getting emails and when they go to pick it up, it's not there.""

M: ""Okay I'm going to put you on hold and see if I can find someone to help.""

Less than five minutes later she told my coworker it wasn't a good time to talk because she was about to see her son, who is in rehab.

Then, she calls back a while later. 

M: ""Okay, do you have your order number?""

JS: ""No. My phone is locked up and I can't get into it. It's there, I send my daughter it pick up stuff from there because I'm not allowed there.""

M: ""Could it be at a different store?"" 

JS: ""No I live here.""

M: ""Okay let me go look my the computer and see what I can figure out.""

A different coworker and I look up her name and see her order history through our store. All of her items had went to a store in the other town. Just like they did the month before.

She's banned from entering our store and she kept ordering items, in her name, but thought because someone else was actually picking it up it would be okay. The system auto kicks her to the closest store.

M: ""So it looks like your stuff is actually at the other store.""

JS: ""Ugh this is ridiculous. Your store keeps messing this up, I'm so pissed. I want a number to call someone, I want to speak to who is in charge of this.""

I gave her the customer service number and thanked god that I finally got to hang up.

Tl;dr:  Woman keeps ordering items to our store, even though she's banned from entering, and gets mad when her items are sent to a different location.",TalesFromRetail
t3_czxn1i,Confused callers,"Posting from mobile, first post, you know the deal. On to the story!

For context, I work for a small scale warehouse style retail store that is similarly named to our competitor. People sometimes mix us up, as to be expected. Due to the similar naming, I get calls like this: 

*phone rings*
Me: Thank you for calling ""store name"", this is ""me"", how can I help you?
Customer: Is this the store on ""not our address""?
Me: No, I'm sorry. We don't have a location at that address. I think its a possibility you may have meant to call our competitor store?
C: That's not possible! Isn't this ""competitor name""!?!
Me: Unfortunately it is not, this is ""store name"", I know its quite familiar to the other store, but we are entirely separate companies.
C: So you're not ""competitor store""?
Me: No, we're not. 
C: Are you sure? Didn't you used to be one?!?
Me: No, I'm sorry. Again we're entirely separate stores, unfortunate similar names, but they're actually our competitor.
C: That's just weird, I thought you were all the same....are you sure?
Me: Yes I'm sure.
C: Fine, can you give me their phone number?
Me: I'm sorry, unfortunately I dont have their phone number.
C: THAT'S JUST RIDICULOUS! *HANGS UP*
Me: *yells at phone* Why would I give you my competitors number?!?!

I mean a quick Google search clearly shows that they're two separate companies, with different (although similar) names! Yet this happens ALL the time. Reading is really hard I guess..

t3_czup1n,Old Couple Blames Me For Them Not Knowing They Had An Account With The Store.,"Over the summer of 2019, I worked as a sales associate for a store that was due to close in a few months. Liquidation brought out the worst of the worst in my town it seemed because of the crazy sales we had, so I dealt with more rude customers than usual. I'll probably post more of the stories later after this one. 

One of my friends had recently gotten a job working as a sales associate with me, so I was training her on the registers and how to navigate customer accounts. It was the end of the day and I had been having my friend using my associate ID to use the register all day, but I decided to take over for her since I was faster and had her cleaning the cash wrap while I finished up the line. An older couple got to the register and everything was going okay. Granted, it was late and I was exhausted, so I wasn't exactly going through all the things I usually say. Usually after scanning everything, we asked the customers if they had any points they'd like to use and then either ask them to type in their phone number or we ask for it and type it in ourselves depending on what point of the transaction we were on. I didn't ask those questions, but the husband asked, ""Do I have to enter in my phone number?"" 

I replied with, ""No, not unless you have an account with us that you want to use."" He said, ""Ah okay no."" which then prompted me to skip past the part where I'd have to enter in their number. I considered this as my excuse to not say anything else about it considering the customer just said they don't have an account. I ring them up, they pay, I give them their receipt, and they walked off to the side. I began to ring up the next and last customer in my line for the day and notice the old couple standing there with their receipt in hand looking confused. They try to come to me for questions, but I'm busy with a massive load of clothes from my last customer and ask my friend, who has finished cleaning at this point, to help the couple while I finish up. 

I look over after I get finished with the last customer to see the couple and my friend staring at the receipt in confusion. I walk over to help because my friend doesn't do well with confrontation, and figured watching me would help her, and they ask me where on the receipt it shows how many points they have. I told them that points are connected to accounts, and that because they didn't have a number put in, they never accessed an account and therefore never got points on the purchase. The husband complains saying, ""I didn't know we had an account. I've always just put my number in and gotten points."" 

I replied with, ""If a number gets you points, that means you have an account.  You said you didn't have an account so a number was never put in."" The husband then asked me to refund the sale so they could redo it. I tell them I can't. Because the store was going through liquidation, we weren't allowed to do refunds or do exchanges. All sales were final, no exceptions. This was my first job, and I wasn't about to risk it due to the incredibly strict liquidator who was in charge of everything at this point. The couple gets irritated with me and asks for my manager. Once this happens, I reach for the phone and ignore the couple while I call for a manager over the intercoms. My manager comes over and I begin to tell her what happened, trying to be as polite as I could be. 

I begin by saying, ""This customer is complaining about not having any points from this purchase. They said they didn't have an account-""

The man cuts me off rudely and says, ""Now I never said that! Don't go putting words in my mouth, girl!"" 

I have a bad temper, so this makes my blood boil. I'm a college student. Not some child. I do not take well to being disrespected like that. I laughed and smiled, but keep quiet as to not get myself into any trouble. My manager jumped in and began leading the conversation. She told them that there's nothing on our end we can do, but gave them online information that would allow them to log into their account, type in the number on their receipt, and get the points from the purchase. they complain about me, and my manager says, ""She's new. She doesn't have it all figured out yet."" I'm a quick learner (hence why I was actually training people as well) and my manager understood that, so this was just a way to get the customer to lay off of me for their incompetence.  They go on a tangent about how horrible service is why we were going out of business (not true) and that they'd never do business with the store again. Somewhere in this rant the woman speaks about how ""corrupt the company is"" and how we're ""just out to steal more money from customers."" Not the case, but my manager and I just let them go on. My manager apologized again and made sure they had the information they needed before asking them to leave. I smiled at them and said, ""Have a good night!"" Once they left, my manager told me to not worry about what just happened. It wasn't my fault they didn't know they had an account with us. She tells us to start closing our registers. 

I turn to my friend who looked stressed out for me. She thanked me for dealing with the customers because she would have freaked out. I shrugged it off. I'd rather throw myself at rude customers than let my friend have to deal with them.",TalesFromRetail
t3_czpiah,50ct is too much,"My mom's a gardener and I help her out by selling plants, flowers, and vegetables at the farmers market every saturday.

It was around may so we were selling peonies.
We put them in a bucket for people to choose the ones they liked best, so that they could bring them to me, I would count the stems and give them the price for the flowers.

A lady comes up to me with three of them in hand and asks me:

L: Is the price per stem or bud?

Me: It's 50 ct per stem.

L: This one has two buds while the others have just one. They should be cheaper.

Me: I'm sorry, price is per stem.

L: But they are worth less, because they only have one bud each.

Me: Look at it that way: The ones with only one bud are 50 ct, but the one with two buds is still only 50 ct. So you'll effectively get that one for cheaper.

L: No, I don't want to pay that much for something so puny.

Me: I'm sorry, but the price is set. Maybe you can find another one with more than one bud?

She then shoved them at me while saying ""goodbye"" with a hateful look in her eyes.

t3_czq7yr,"Hey, I don't have to help you.","In past posts I've blamed my behavior on the hot weather, or workload, or lack of sleep, but today I don't have any of those excuses. I might have a serious mental problem. 

I'm working in the back as usual, pretty chill day and stuff is going well, when they call from the front of the store to have me go out and pump propane. Pretty rare that they ask lately, guess they must be slammed up there.

On my way out I see a dirty white pickup truck with a couple guys hanging out, but they're not at the propane pump so I ignore them. Still, there's this funny little twist in my gut... I can't tell you what it is but there's something about that truck that spells trouble. Just a regular couple of guys in work clothes chatting but... I don't know. I make a mental note to ask about them later.

At the pump is a nice lady in a knee brace and an older fella waiting with BBQ tanks. Dude says ""ladies first"" in that casual old-world  it-would-be-embarassing-not-to kind of way. Okay my dude, respect. 

I take a picture of the date on the tank (procedures, I won't bore you with why we do that) and fill it up for Knee Brace. She takes it away, I upload the numbers to the store so she can go in and pay, and reset the pump.

Here's where things get interesting. 

As I walk over to Old Dude's tank I see one of the pickup guys approaching with his own tank, one of the big industrial ones. Okay, whatever. I crouch down to take a picture of the BBQ tank and Pickup says: ""Just the one.""

I look up and shake my head. ""Okay?""

For the record: I'm told that my emotions register very clearly on my face. I'm a terrible liar and avoid poker.

So at this point I've given him a clear ""can't you see I'm busy"" look... And really that should be it. But it isn't. 

I find the date on the BBQ tank and take the picture. As I stand Pickup pipes up: ""Hey, I was here first! I've been waiting!""

I barely glance in his direction: ""When I walked up I saw two people standing at the pump, so that's who I'm helping.""

""I've been waiting 25 minutes! Come on now this is ridiculous!""

Okay... lemme process this.

1. Somehow 25 minutes went by before anyone let me know about propane. Bullsh!t.

2. You're a big guy who's clearly in shape, but you expected your place in line to be held while you lounge in your truck because standing is too much for you.

3. You actually want to butt in line in front of a sweet old man.

But I couldn't even get mad. It was like watching a clown. A bemused smile creeps across my face as I beheld the man-child.

I mulled over what to do, seeing as how I didn't want Old Dude to feel uncomfortable, but then he said: ""Well I've been waiting too and I went inside to get someone for propane.""

If Old Dude wants to stand his ground that's good enough for me. Pickup starts up with ""No I've been here..."" but I cut him off: ""I'll be with you in a minute."" I grab the BBQ tank.

Pickup loses his mind. ""This is unbelievable. I've been waiting this whole time and now you're just gonna let...""

I shrug, make eye contact, and shoot him a grin: ""Hey, I don't have to fill your tank.""

I try not to laugh as I let him rant for 15-20 more seconds before I realize he's wasting Old Dude's time, which is not okay. I put up a hand and say in my best go-sit-in-the-corner voice: ""Hey, I'm going to fill this now. Take a breath!""

He stomps off to his truck in impotent rage as I fill Old Dude's tank and we chat. It only takes a few seconds, which is too bad because he seems like a nice guy. Big family get together this weekend, daughter's coming in from out of town with the grandkids and everything. 

I wish him well, upload his numbers to the store so he can pay, and reset the pump. I grab the big tank and Pickup starts coming over for round 2, but something about the way I look at him stops him half way. He decides to continue his whining from a safe distance. 

At this point I want to take a second and go back to the concerns I raised at the top of this post. 

Because I didn't shoot him a look of warning or some kind of angry expression. I wasn't mad, or worried about the fact that the guy was bit taller than me and looked like he could handle himself, or even vaguely interested in customer service BS. None of that was even on the radar.

If anything I was just... Amused. A grown man acting this way. It was just kinda funny.

He tries to paint the picture of just how horrifyingly tragic it is that I've made him wait, spitting and getting all red faced as his shouts echo around the lot. I give him enough time to fail to make a point before enough of my amusement turns to disgust and I cut him off: ""Hey, do you want me to fill this tank or not?""

He reels a bit but comes back for round 3: ""I'm working over at the other store fixing the roof you know!""

""... and?""

""Well who do I have to talk to about this...""

Bored now. I turn around and switch on the pump. He keeps ranting. I ignore him - I can't hear him over the noise of the pump from all the way over there anyway. 

When I switch it off he's still going. I give him a surprised look and say: ""Sorry, what was that?""

He looks like he wants to kill me but at this point it is super hard for me not to laugh. I do notice he isn't closing the distance between us yet. Good boy.

""I'm going to put in a complaint about you!""

""Oh, please do,"" I say with a sincere and hopeful smile.

""Well here I am waiting all this time while you play on your phone...""

I laugh. ""Oh, is that what I'm doing?""

And again, what is wrong with me? I used to be so scared of confrontation or getting in trouble but I sincerely, deeply, wholeheartedly could not give a fk about this whining roofer.

I upload the numbers. He continues to try idle threats but I'm too bored to pay attention and leave. He waits until I'm far enough away before he grabs the tank. 

Manager later confirms he's super annoying when he goes in to pay, having embellished his tale of woe to include the fact that he's on his lunch break. 

Hey. Don't annoy my manager. She works hard.

At the front of the store, near the registers, we have stacks of bags of charcoal. There are a few different kinds, all clearly labeled. Two of the bags look rather similar, being the same colour, but still clearly different brands if you bother to read. These two are placed at opposite ends with two or three other brands in between them. They are Samurai (cheap brand, we'll say $10) and Shogun (expensive brand, we'll say $40).

Naturally, people will sometimes put something back in the wrong place after deciding they don't want it.

So, one fateful day, a middle-aged gentleman comes to my register (I'm not going to call him ""MAG"" because I think it's silly to abbreviate names like that in stories like these. No offense to those who do, I just don't see the point) with a shopping cart filled with your normal groceries, and as I'm scanning the items, he walks over to the charcoal pallets.

I see him walk over to the Samurai stack, and I notice that someone had placed a bag of Shogun on it. He scans the prices up on the wall and picks up the Shogun bag, since it was supposedly the cheapest one he saw.

I know what's going to happen, so I try to diffuse the situation before it even happens (naturally, you know I fail since you're reading this story).

""Sir, just so you know, that charcoal is Shogun; not Samurai from the stack where you found it. It's $40,"" I tell him.

He looks at the bag and then back up at the wall above the Samurai stack and sees the price.

""But it says $10 on the price label,"" he responds.

I point out, ""That's for the Samurai charcoal, it says so right above the price.""

""... but I got it from that stack,"" he said, pointing to the Samurai stack.

""I understand, but it's not the same brand. Another customer must have put it there when they decided they didn't want it.""

Now, I should say I have a small tic where I quickly turn my head to the side. Usually happens when I get stressed, and dealing with this guy was starting to get stressful. So my tic happens, and his eyes light up.

""Oh! Oh, I see,"" he feigns. He must think I'm mentally challenged because of my tic.

He continues, ""Well, champ, why don't you go ahead and scan it and we'll see what price comes up?"" with a stupid grin on his face, 1,000,000,000% sure it's going to scan at $10.

I scan it, and sure enough, $40.

""But the sign says $10!"" he whines.

I try to show him the Shogun stack, ""Sir, if you'd look over there, *that* is the brand that you have here; Shogun.""

He looks over and sees the Shogun stack. He looks back at the Samurai stack, the Shogun bag, and the prices of both brands. Something clicks. He doesn't say anything for a few moments, and I can hear him thinking.

""...Oh, so they're different. Well, you still have to sell me this one for $10, though.""

???

""I'm sorry, sir, I can't do that.""

""You have to; it's the law!"" he barks.

""I'm sorry, what law is that?"" I ask, slightly scared.

""It was mislabled, so you have to sell it to me for the lower price! It's false advertising otherwise!""

A guy from another lane shouts over, ""Dude, that's not what false advertising is. Someone just put the wrong bag on that stack, you idiot!""

Charcoal dude ignores him and says, ""Are you going to sell it to me for the lower price or do I have to talk to your manager?""

I'm just about done with this guy, so I shout back towards Customer Service, ""ID!"" (We need a Manager ID card to change prices. That's not why I called, though; it also brings a manager out to solve any issues.)

So one of the managers arrives and I explain what happened to her, with him trying to butt in every few seconds. I forgot exactly what he said, but he lied about some aspects, and the guy who was in the other lane was still there, so he came over and corroborated my version of events.

My manager said, ""I'm sorry, sir. The prices are clearly marked and this is clearly Shogun brand charcoal, which is $40. Samurai brand charcoal is $10. If you want charcoal for $10, your only option is the Samurai brand.""

The guy looked back the charcoal pallets and the Shogun bag he had.

""... BUT IT'S THE LAW! I'M SUPPOSED TO GET THE CHEAPER PRICE BY LAW! IT'S THE LAW!""

(You'd think he was a lawyer with how much he said the word ""law"")

He argued with my manager for a few more seconds, but she wouldn't budge. He eventually got fed up and stormed off without his groceries, yelling, ""THEY'RE BREAKING THE LAW! FALSE ADVERTISING! IT'S AGAINST THE LAW! REEEEEEEEEEEEE!"" (Okay, he didn't really screech, but I'm taking artistic liberty).",TalesFromRetail
t3_czfrmk,"""Empty your cart"" does not mean ""You're a thief""","TL;DR: Defensive customer thought I suspected her of being a thief when I was just following an empty cart store policy.

Quick backstory on me: I work at a small mom and pop supermarket in a relatively small city. I started working there in 2010 as a bagger, but I switched over to the cashier position later down the line, which I actually enjoy more. And I've been doing so well at it that, since earlier this year, I was promoted to being a trainer.

The thing about us, though, is that even though everyone who works here is just the nicest bunch of folks you've ever met, we have certain policies that customers need to follow. For instance, and this is the one policy that's relevant to this post, customers need to completely empty their cart when going through the check-out line, including 24 packs of sodas, waters, beer, etc., but excluding large items like 3 or 5 gallon water jugs, since those can be rung up from our machines. To some, this sounds like a dumb policy, but we have our reasons. This policy is in order in case, at best, the customer forgets an item behind a soda pack, or at worst, a shoplifter is trying to sneak something out of the store.

In any case, here's the cast for today's story: Me, Defensive Customer (DC), Awesome Manager (AM), and Caring Service-desk girl (CS).

So today was day 2 of my new student's training session. Things are going pretty smoothly, she's getting used to the way things work, and some of the other check-out lines are open, including the one right next to us. Whenever I train someone, I usually hang out in the line space next to my student's register, which gives me time to not only help her, but help other customers who come through the next line and give them some assistance. Enter DC, who comes through the next-door line with her groceries including 4 packs of diet name-brand citrus soda. There's just one problem: only one of them is on the belt and three are still in the cart. So I politely empty her cart and the conversation goes something like this (note: most of this is paraphrased since I don't entirely remember what was said):

Me: Oh, I can get the rest of those up there for you.

DC: Can't she (the cashier waiting on her) just do a quantity scan from there?

Me: Unfortunately we have an empty cart store policy. Everything has to be out of the cart.

DC: This is BS! WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER?!

Me: I can call a manager for you, but he's going to tell you the same thing, that the cart needs to be empty.

DC: So are you saying that I'M A THIEF? I'M NOT A THIEF! I'VE NEVER STOLEN ANYTHING! (except I, at no point, said anything about her being a thief)

At this point, I'm pretty much done with her crap. When she started snapping at me like that, I called the general manager (AM) to the register at his convenience so that he could explain things to her. I told him exactly what happened, though it was hard for me to because I was stuttering through my words. Keep in mind, in the nine years I worked at this store, no one had ever snapped at me like that, so I really wasn't mentally prepared for something like this. DC tried to interject, saying that ""HE THOUGHT I WAS A THIEF, THEY ALL DID!"" (referring to the other employees present), but because I mentioned the empty cart policy, AM explained everything to the customer, and that seemed to quiet her down.

So once her order was complete, she left the store. And at this point, I'm visibly shaken, doing my damnedest to hold back tears from how frustrated and livid I was that I just had that encounter. One of the girls from the service desk (CS), came up and gave me a hug, which I was thankful for, and the owner of the store assured me that if DC called to complain to him about what had happened, she'd just be ignored. Just goes to show how great it is to work at a mom and pop store. If something happens to one of us, we'll step in and care for each other.",TalesFromRetail
t3_czet3i,Customer complains when I do my job correctly.,"I work at a popular sandwich chain. Earlier this year, we started using a popular online delivery service. We make the food, the company provides the drivers. We get the online orders via a device, which prints off two receipts stating what is on the order - one for us for our records, and one for the customer that gets stuck on the bag containing their food with a sticker. 

So yesterday, I get an order on the device for two sandwiches. One is normal. The other is our veggie option. But it's a strange one... all they've asked for is bread, with cheese, and two sauces. And that's it.

Usually, the whole point of ordering the veggie sandwich... is adding vegetables to it. 

But I think ""hey, well, if they have a problem with it, I'm sure they'll let us know.""  

Yep. 

Yes he did. 

Not 10 minutes after the delivery driver leaves, the phone rings. 

C - Customer. Me - me. 

Me: ""Hello, this is the sandwich shop""

C: ""Uh.... is this some kind of joke?""

Me, faux-confused: ""Huh?""

C: ""There's no salad in my sandwich. What the"" confused garbles and frustration. 

Okay. 

His tone of voice pissed me off. No ""hello, excuse me, but there's been a mistake"" or ""could I ask why my sandwich is weird"". Not polite, not nice. Just ""ISTHISSOMEKINDOFAJOKE"" like the typical male Karen I assumed he would be.

I get it. When I don't get what I ordered (or in this case what he presumed he ordered) I of course would phone and question it. But I try and be at least somewhat decent to a complete stranger just trying to do their job. This guy was not being a decent person. His tone of voice was condescending, and rude.

Customer service mode activated, but firm, I explain the mistake he made to him, and how I did, in fact, make what he ordered. 

C: ""But I swear I ordered salad.""

Me: ""Unfortunately no, you did not.""

I then read back his receipt, verbatim, and basically said ""sorry but it's your fault.""

He asked if he could get another sandwich. I told him to phone the delivery company or order again online. 

I told my manager. She told her manager. She then told myself and the other employees on a group chat that yeah, it was his fault, but her manager said to ""check if this happens in future, to call the customer.""

How about no. 

How about I make what you order. 

How about you use your eyes and your common sense when ordering online. 

I'm just glad I wasn't penalised for doing my job correctly. 

Check your food order before you confirm it. Don't be an idiot and order a ketchup and mayo cheese toastie by mistake. And if you do, do. Not. Blame. The. Employees. For doing their job, for creating your fuck up of an order. 

The man apparently phoned the company and asked for a refund, which my manager's manager refused. 

All in all, it was pretty funny.",TalesFromRetail

t3_cz7p5q,He demanded a return on a $500 purchase that hadn't been delivered yet,"This took place maybe two years ago.

We were having a normal day at the good ol' retail store when a customer comes in. He's on speaker phone with corporate and swearing up a storm about how he needed to return his online purchase of furniture. We have a system that allows us to cancel orders so long as they haven't been shipped. We can do returns on the orders as well if we get the items.

Of course corporate told him that we could make the return at the store. So the assistant manager checks their order number and finds out that the item has been shipped and is in process. More beautiful colorful language spills out of his crusty lips when she tells him that we can't do the return until he brings the item in. It's too far into the shipping process to change the shipping location. Our company uses a third party delivery system that isn't the three US name brand companies so we get little room to accommodate customers when it comes to shipping furniture.

But he still demands a refund and usually the manager can say no since in this situation there was nothing we could do until he had the item. She suggested he bring it in and return it once the item arrived but he refused. The idiot from corporate told my manager to do the return and they'd cancel the shipment somehow. We all knew that wasn't possible with our company and she told the person on the phone that, but they insisted, and the customer would not stop calling the manager a bitch.

He called the assistant manager more colorful language as he got his money back and left the store.

So that's a big hit for the store that day since the returns come out of our daily profits. It was basically a blank return since we had no item to take in for it.

A few weeks later he comes in screaming again. They delivered his furniture that he'd gotten a return on and he needed us to come get it from his house. Even though we knew that we had no way of arranging that, the Operations Manager spent about an hour on the phone with corporate trying to arrange a pick up. Corporate noped that up. If he wanted the furniture off his hands he'd have to bring it to the store himself, or ship it back at his expense.

None of us could figure out why he didn't just keep the furniture or sell it. No one was going to keep track of where it went off to at this point. The order had been canceled weeks ago according to corporate.

A few days later he came back, demanding during a store rush that someone help him bring the furniture inside. We were glad to do it and shocked that he actually brought it back.

Our operations manager decided to look in and figure out what happened with the order. The person from corporate on the phone with our assistant manager to begin with, marked the shipment as in progress and flipped the situation around so it looked like we refunded against store policy.

At this point it was basically free inventory. There was a whole lot of hassle on our end and the customers, to actually make that happen.

That company was something else.

I'm from Germany and english  is my second language. I'm writing on my phone, because it helps me to spell the word correctly.

I work as an optician in one of the biggest optician companies in Germany. I a the deputy branch manager.

Yesterday I had an insane old man as a customer. And this is how it went.

Me=me 

OD=old dude

My apprentice had send over to OD. Ge was sitting at one of our tables his rollater and his sunglasses in his hands.

Me: good day, my name is me,how may I help you. OD: I lost my glasses for long distance and need new one with the eyesight of my sunglasses.

Me: no problem, do you have your eyesight in writing? OD: no Me:Okay, had you ever bought glasses at our company? OD: mumbles something I can't understand.

I assume he doesn't know. So I take the tablet to check our database.

Me: what's your last name, please? OD: mumbles agai Me: sorry, could you please repeat that, I wasn't able to understand you properly because of the background noise. (It wasn't really loud, but OD was rude in his tone, from the beginning and I didn't want it to escalate.) OD(in a really rude tone): wy do you need it anyway. Me: I need it, to look you up in your database. OD: you can not find me there, I've never bought glasses here before.

Me: okay, then i need your sunglasses to check the eyesight of the lenses.

He doesn't react at all, but lets me take the sunglasses. I can see at first sight, that the glasses are not older than 2 years and that they are without powers.

I go and check anyway, to not upset him even more. While I'm on the way he shouts after me in an even ruder tone than before: I hope that I'll get them back. (Yes OD really accuses me of stealing his 2 year old sunglasses I an optician shop)

So I went to check the power of the lenses and as I thought, 0,0dpt in both lenses. No eyesight at all.

So I went back and tell him Me: sorry but there are no eyesight in your sunglasses.

And that is the point when it got ridiculous.

OD: your are lying. You just want to cover up your incompetence. These sunglasses where prescribed by a doctor. You're accusing the doctor of lying. Your company is crap anyway and I'll leave and never come back.

I was say nothing. Just stop up got to the door and opened it for him, while i was thinking: good, this way I don't have to kick him out.

On his way out he stopt at the table next to us and complained about something I couldn't understand. Then he went on his way out. I  the moment he got to the door he turned to me for one last time. OD: I hope your whole company has to close for good. You are the worst. Me: have a nice day.

t3_cz5prj,Oil Idiot...,"Mobile spelling you get the picture.


So a little background im a manager at an Auto parts store. Our policy is take care of the customer no matter what. We offer online ordering. An order comes through for 1 quart of valvoline full synthetic 5w20 high mileage and a filter. A little weird but i shrug it off collect the order and stage it in the area assigned. About an hour later this customer comes in and my coworker collects his order. I dont hear any exchange but happen to be passing by and Customer says ""I want what i paid for"" naturally i stop in my tracks and see whats up.


C: I paid for 6 qts of oil thats what i want


Me: Sir this is what you paid for.


C: Shows me email receipt reflecting 1 qt of oil and 1 oil filter ""SEE!!!""


Me: Yes it says 1 qt and 1 filter. 1 qt is 10.49 plus tax and filter is x.xx youre total was xx.xx.


C: No look your website says 6 qts of oil for 10.49


Now the website says its 1 Quart Valvoline Full Synthetic 5w20 high Mileage Case of 6 for its description and i explained to him that simply meant a case was 6 quarts. He was having none of it and asked that question everyone asks ""Are you a manager""


Me: Yes sir I am the store manager you paid for 1 qt this is that quart.


C: ok i know what i have to do.


He walks away leaving his order on the counter and us like dude youre nuts if you think youre getting 6 qts of any oil for 10 dollars anywhere. After about 15 minutes he comes back to the counter and says we would hear from corporate and he would be back tomorrow for his oil.


I call my boss and our Customer Complaint Secretary and neither of them had heard the complaint at the time but my boss was adamant he would tell this guy hes nuts if it came back to him.


Cut to the next day he shows back up while im out smoking a cigarette. My coworker walks out and asks if im ready to deal with the D bag from yesterday. So i go inside and hes at the oil wall. I keep an eye on him just in case he wants to make a run for it. After about 5 minutes he comes to the counter. He has a 5 quart jug of the same oil and some fuel treatment. He paid with a gift card sent to his email with exactly 53 dollars on it. In the end he got what he wanted and all he had to do was call and complain that someone wouldnt give him 50 dollars in oil for 10 dollars.",TalesFromRetail
t3_czbymc,When a lack of sleep makes you seem rude to a customer,"The last few weeks the store I work at has been understaffed in almost every single department. As much as we're all loving getting the over time, it's taking a toll on our exhaustion levels. Throw in customers who don't care that we're doing what we can with what little staff we have, a new store manager, and staff getting grumpy with each other, things are getting kind of stressful. So it really made my week to witness this exchange between a cashier and a customer.

We keep certain things (perfume, electronics, flea medication) locked up in cases and on hooks that an employee has to come unlock then keep at a register until the customer is ready to check out completely.  

Customer: Ummm so can I please have the flea stuff

Cashier: Sorry but I have to keep this at my register until you're ready to check out. I'm at 14

Cashier: (even more visibly confused) The one in between registers 13 and 15? I'll have my light on?

Customer: Keep the damn stuff I don't need to be treated like this!

t3_cyu2na,"""I Want To Haggle, Even If You Don't!""","A woman comes up to the registers with a massive, beautiful area rug that we just got in. It's been priced at $100-ish, which is high for our usual thrift store prices, but is still well below retail. She doesn't have the ""I want to speak to your manager"" haircut that I can tell, mostly because it's been tied up in a bun.

EL = Entitled Lady, C = Coworker, and Me (pretty much peripheral)

&gt;The first words out of her mouth to my Coworker was, ""Excuse me, is there any wiggle room on this rug?""  
&gt;  
&gt;C: ""No, I'm afraid not.""  
&gt;  
&gt;EL: ""Well the price is just too high, considering there's some damage to it.""

&gt;C: ""The department head would have researched the value and made adjustments. I'm afraid I can't do anything against that.""  
&gt;  
&gt;EL: ""Well I need a rug to cover some damage my kids did to our carpets, and I need it by Tuesday for a house showing. Can I speak to your manager?""  
&gt;  
&gt;C: ""Our store manager has gone home for the day, and our store is closed for Labor Day. I'm afraid if you want to talk about a price adjustment, you'll have to wait until Tuesday morning at 10am.""

&gt;  
&gt;EL: ""This is ridiculous!""

The woman scribbles down her name, number and a complaining message about how the rug was too expensive and how she wants to get a partial refund on this rug to reduce the cost down to $50, as well as a military discount on top of the price reduction. Then she pays for the rug and stomps out.

We posted the message on the store manager's office door, along with a note saying that I and my coworker told her multiple times that we don't haggle, OR give refunds.

Since I don't work on Tuesdays, I'm almost sorry I will have to wait to hear about the incoming Category 5 Tantrum that will likely ensue.

**Update:**

So Thursday was my first day back and I asked my store manager what happened. Events regaled to me as follows:

Store Manager came back to work to read the note. She proceeds to laugh and shake her head in disbelief at the audacity of this Entitled Lady before opening her office and starting up the daily stuff. She also checks the security feed for the day in question.

10am on the dot, when the store opens, the phone rings. Apparently, EL was not satisfied to simply leave a note and/or wait to be called back with an answer. Nope! She's on the phone with her spiel prepped and everything.

Store Manager politely listens to the whole song and dance. Amazingly the story remained consistent, with no added details, or claims that her son's cancer ridden puppy needs the money back for life saving miracle cures. Nope! She is literally admitting, again, that she has used the rug to hide damage to the house she showed early this morning and just wants her money back, or at least some of it.

&gt;EL, winding down her story: ""...So that's why I'm hoping you can work with me on this.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Store Manager: ""Hmm. Well, actually, no, I can't.""

Beat of stunned silence.

&gt;EL: ""I'm sorry, what do you mean you can't?""  
&gt;  
&gt;Store Manager: ""I can't. We don't do refunds at this store.""

(Rare occasions being an accidental overcharge, we CAN refund, but it's same day only, we don't advertise that we do it, and this lady doesn't need to know about rare exceptions because those only happen when WE are at fault.)

&gt;EL: ""But the rug was too expensive!""  
&gt;  
&gt;Store Manager: ""And yet, you purchased the rug anyway, after being told that you would NOT be getting ANY money back.""  
&gt;  
&gt;EL: ""But nobody said that! Nobody told me that I couldn't return it, or get a price adjustment!""  
&gt;  
&gt;Store Manager: ""Ma'am, you WERE told that, multiple times.""  
&gt;  
&gt;EL, 0 - 100 instantly: ""ARE YOU CALLING ME A LIAR?!""  
&gt;  
&gt;Store manager, calmly, ""Ma'am, we have video AND audio of the twenty minute long argument you had with both of my employees. They both very clearly inform you multiple times that we don't haggle and we don't refund.""

Crickets.

&gt;Store Manager: ""Now, as I see it, you have a choice: either keep the rug, or donate it somewhere. Either way, we appreciate the money you have generously donated to all the homeless kitties and puppies at our local animal shelter. Have a nice day.""

Click.

I was honestly kind of speechless at the epic beauty of this complete shutdown of an EL. I don't know if my manager embellished on what she had said to this woman (as I am hearing it a couple of days after the fact) but I think I am going to pretend it's all true and hold that happy little thought in my heart for the rest of my days.",TalesFromRetail

For background, I'm a manager at a dollar store. This happened today, a few hours prior, so it's been a holiday weekend and labor day was fairly busy.

My only coworker (CO) and I (ME) were both cleaning separate sections of the health aisle. I was organizing some pill boxes when an old lady (OL) approached me.

OL: ""Can you tell me where to find these for my shoes?"" Points to her feet.

Lucky for her, all the shoe insert and accessories were just to the right of the area I was organizing. I step over the area.

ME: ""You'll find all our shoe inserts right here.""

OL: ""No, you weren't listening to me. I need these."" She now waves both hands at her feet.

My coworker is within earshot and we share a look of ???.

ME: ""Ma'am if you need anything shoe insert related items are located here.""

OL: ""No, you aren't listening to me. I need these."" One more gesture to her feet. ""I need them to go on the inside.""

ME: ""Ma'am, everything we have related to shoe inserts will be here. Maybe it's one of these smaller packages here."" I gesture to smaller heel/ball inserts.

OL: ""NO, you aren't listening to me. I don't need shoe inserts. I need them for the front of my feet."" She touches the insert at the balls of her feet.

I'm lost, I have shown her the smaller partial cushions. Literally she touched the ball insert of sandals and I already pointed to those on our display. CO has walked to the end of the aisle, later she said she didn't know if she was going to laugh or tell OL off. I'm defeated. 

ME: ""Ma'am, if it's not there, then we don't sell them.""

I kid you not, just as I finish my sentence she grabs one of the smaller packages, that I POINTED to earlier. 

OL: ""No, it's right here. You should really learn the items you sell before saying something like that.""

I'm done. I don't understand her logic, but whatever she found it. May only the balls of her feet be cushioned while berates other employees. I turn back to organizing my pill shelf, quietly seething.

But she's not done. 

OL: ""Thanks for being useless with your help.""

I want so badly to say something witty or dry back to her, but I didn't really want to deal with her. I just met her gaze and simply said, ""OK."" in my customer service voice. 

I don't know what she was expecting, but apparently that wasn't it. Her face contorted as she thought of something to say, but I didn't give her much. She finally settles on looking offended that I wasn't insulted and huffs off.

CO warns me that OL asked for my name and is planning on complaining. CO had already said she would give her side of the story to the store manager. Texted my store manager a heads up and she already said ""Just because a customer complains, doesn't mean they're in the right.""

Literally my first thought after everything happened was posting here. Just had to vent before I hit the hay.

TL;DR Customer asks to me to find an item. As I point to it, she accuses of not listening, takes said item and believes she is the one who found it.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cz0ze0,Customer Threatens to Sue Me Because His Warer Was Turned Off,"I used to work for a kitchen appliance repair company, I worked the phones answering calls, booking appointments, ect. The job was horrible, people are much more comfortable treating you poorly when they don't have to look you in the face.

Anyway, a little bit of information. Most appliance companies (Samsung, Whirlpool, Kitchenaid) have a one year warranty covering repairs, however this warranty is only valid so long as there's something actually wrong with the appliance itself since companies cannot control if, for example, it's a plumbing issue. 

One day I got a call transferred to me by another coworker because he was having issues with his headset. The little information I got was that this customer was angry that we were charging him our flat rate service fee of $125. His dishwasher was covered by the one year warranty and he claimed there was no water going into the machine. Our technician arrives, inspects the dishwasher and can't find any reason as to why it wouldn't be getting water, so he checks the water going into the house and, lo and behold, his water had been shut off the entire time. Samsung, the manufacturer of the dishwasher, reviewed the case and declined to pay for it since they hadn't produced a faulty machine, the tech tested it after turning the water on and it worked perfect. Now back to present day, the customer calls me...

Customer is CX

Me is... Me

Me: ""Hi my name is _____, sorry about the transfer, my coworker's headset isn't connecting. I understand you need some clarification on some charges?""

CX: ""I am VERY UPSET! My dishwasher is under warranty so why should I have to pay this?""

Here I explain to him what I said above.

CX: ""That's unfair, I shouldn't be charged. It's under warranty! And on top of that you sent the bill to collections. Collections, really?! Unprofessional!""

Me: ""Sir, we had sent the bill to you 3 times already, we emailed, called, left voicemails but heard nothing back from you. The inspection happened almost 6 months ago. I'm sorry you're upset but Samsung declined to pay since that responsibility fell onto you.""

CX: ""I can't even believe this. I want your name right now.""

Keep in mind I've summarized a lot of our conversation already since for the most part it was just him repeating the same things. After being on the phone for probably around 15 minutes listening to this guy complain I was losing my patience and got a little snippy (my version of snippy anyway).

Me: ""As I said, my name is _____.""

CX: ""I need your last name too!""

Me: ""Um, no, I'm not going to give you that. I'm the only _____ that works at this company in this city. If you need to speak to me again-""

CX: ""NO!""

The guy is full on yelling over the phone now.

CX: "" I need your last name RIGHT NOW. I'm going to sue you! You can't just take me to collections!""

Riiiiight. Sue the barely 21 year old, bottom of the ladder, girl for following protocol that was set up by a completely different company. Also this is the first time I ever spoke or got involved with this guy's case.

Me: ""Sir, I personally didn't send your bill to collections. Your issue is with Samsung's warranty policy, which you agreed to, and the fact that you wouldn't pay a bill that must be paid. At this point all I can you is speak to a manager and they will call you back when they're available.""

I kept pushing to get the customer off the phone for a little while longer, there wasn't anything I could actually do for him. Eventually we wrapped up the conversation, he told me to ""expect to be sued"" a couple more times and that was that. In the end my company pulled back the bill from collections and waived his fee, because they were such huge pushovers. Kind of sucks the guy was the last to laugh, he said some very horrible things to me and got away with it. Oh well, that's customer service I guess.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cz26wd,That other boy was a bit of an idiot...,"First post here after months of reading, thought I'd get this one in before my shift today

I work as a Sales Manager at a rather large furniture store in the UK. Essentially my job is to manage the store; this means stock, presentation standards/layout, helping staff with sales questions but also selling. I have **lots** of stories I could share so let me know if you want more! But for today a short one, see if you can guess the twist!

Cast: ME - yours truly, OL - old lady paying a bill

OL: Hi yes, I need to pay the balance on this please, but also the boy who sold it to me put my phone number in wrong so we need to change it. He wasn't very bright and seemed in a hurry to get rid of us.

ME: Not a problem, let's sit down here and I'll sort all that out for you

OL: Oh thank you, yes to be honest the other boy didn't really seem like he knew what he was doing, must have been new.

After a quick payment I reprint her receipt and run through it with her.

ME: There you go, all paid off, and as you can see at the top I've changed your contact number as  well so there shouldn't be any issues going forward.

OL: Lovely. I must say I'm glad you're here to sort this, *that other boy was a bit of an idiot,* I would keep an eye on him

ME: Oh dear, I'm sorry about that, I'll make sure I check everything of his from now on. Have a lovely day.

PLOT TWIST: The other boy was Me. She was in a week earlier and the only reason my name wasn't on her receipt was because I was finalising the sale for a colleague and she didn't recognise me. I remember her reading her phone number out to me from a tiny piece of scrawled paper in her pocket, I didn't mistype her number she must've read it out wrong. Never mind!",TalesFromRetail
t3_cyywat,Do you want an even bigger bag for those magazines?,"This happened sometime ago. Nothing major but it did leave me in a confused state and end up wondering why this happened. I work in a small retail store that sells newspapers &amp; magazines, stationery, lotteries and other miscellaneous things.

Middle-aged woman buys 2 magazines. Both magazines were standard celebrity-gossip type A4 size magazines. Transaction is all good and she asks for a plastic bag to carry her magazines in. I comply, give her one and help her put the magazines inside. As soon as I finish, she rejects it and asks for a bigger bag. I didn't question it but comply anyway and give her the next size up. 

**Nope.**

Demands an even bigger one. I had to go under the counter to look for the biggest size bag I could find. After about 15 seconds I managed to find one, threw the magazines inside (gently of course) and told her to have a nice day.

Not even out of the store (and still in my sight), she takes the magazines out of the bag and throws the bag away into the rubbish box. She also mutters something under her breath... complaining about the service? Or maybe I pulled off a face that said I was a bit angry at her for this? I don't know.

I stood there confused. Thankfully there was a customer waiting and got myself back into reality fairly quickly. When there was no one left, I took the bag out of the rubbish box (thankfully it wasn't dirty since there was mainly paper in there) and put it back where it was before this all happened.

Very rarely do I get weird interactions since most of the regulars are elderly and they, for the most part, are fairly kind and often straight to the point.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cyri5a,I may just have experienced absolute density.,"I'm not trying to be mean, but I genuinely think that my worldview was just shaken to its core.

I work at a small photostudio as an university student. I love my job. I do the late shifts, my boss is amazing and my coworker is a nice fellow. Sometimes, like today, work is pretty slow which allows me to type out what I just witnessed. This happened literally 10 Minutes ago.

We do the usual corporate photography stuff: biometric passport pictures, business portraits, family, pregnancy, the occasional erotic and sometimes weddings. But we also do things we call ""Fun Articles"". These are little goodies with printed on pictures, for example pillows, phone cases, mugs, etc. ...

There's just two things to know:

1. If you provide the picture, every article is 9.90. If we shoot the picture, the article is 15.95.
2. We don't ""make"" these goodies in our studio (we're like 24m^(2), 16 effectively), we just take the order and our printing facility makes them and sends them to us. This usually takes 3-4 days.

Today, person X came with a friend, y. Y didn't say anything to me, but from what I could hear I already thought ""This might be fun."" They were not an elderly couple, nor did they look uh.. special. Mid to late 20s, fairly upper class, based on their clothes and accessoire.

X came to me and started asking questions about a heart shaped pillow (HSP). The conversation was incredibly long and surreal but I tried to condense it:

X: ""Hello, how much for the HSP?""  
Me: ""Hi, The pillow is 9.90 if you provide the picture. If we shoot the picture, it's 15.95.""   
X: ""So I just print it out and bring it to you?""  
Me (confused): ""No, that doesn't work. We need the digital file.""  
X: ""So you can't print here?""  
Me: ""Uhm... In this studio we print on paper. If you want a HSP, we take your order and print it at our printing facility. A few days later you can pick it up from here.""  
X: ""So you can't print here?""

I was stunned. It was literally the exact same question. I was afraid how to respond because I don't usually have to deal with dense people like this. I didn't understand that she didn't understand. Or maybe she was asking about being able to print it in this exact location? Did she want to see our equipment? Did she test me? I DON'T KNOW!

Me: ""We can't print the HSP here. But we do have a printing facility that will print the HSP for us. It's outside the city ^((not really but hush)). I can take your order if you want.""  
X: ""Yea so the printer isn't here?""  
Me: ""No. It's a little to big for this studio.""  
X: ""Because I have a picture right with me."" 

She pointed at her phone like she won something. Or like she thought I was dense.

  
Me: ""That's convenient, so just send it to our mail adress.""  
X (struggling, stunned): ""How do I do that?""

I reach for a card with our mail adress and show her.

Me: ""You put this mail into the ""to:""- bar and add the picture to the mail. Or you tap on the picture, tap ""send..."" and use ""Mail"". Then you just enter our mail adress.""

X stared at the card, then hat her phone, finally at me. She. Literally. Froze. And stared at me with her mouth open. Even Y started to feel uncomfortable.

X: ""Okay, I will do that. Thank you.""

And then they left. Like, it was right there. She had the phone in her hand, unlocked. Her other hand held the mail adress, the key to our cheesy piece of mass produced fun specifically targetted at baby boomers. I still don't understand how someone in my generation, let them be a few years older, has managed to never learn to mail a picture over the phone. Sometimes, when there's old people trying to do the same thing they just hand me their phone and let me do it for them. But she didn't even ask me. She just took the card and left.

 I'm still baffled.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cyj6yi,Mama bear,"So this is a bit of a twist on the ""we're closed, ma'am"" tales. 

A little over 20 years ago, I was a teenager and worked in the Chicago suburbs for a video rental store. This particular Sunday happened in the middle of winter, and any midwesterner will tell you that winters are brutal. It just so happened that a blizzard that the meteorologists had been predicting for almost a week was bearing down on us at this moment, and the district manager had just called to tell us we'd be closing early. And I'm talking seven hours early. My car wasn't very reliable in the snow so my mom, completely voluntarily and without even telling me she was doing it, drove down to the store to pick me up. She was in the vestibule waiting for me to finish closing duties, and the outside door behind her was locked. We had just closed all the registers when the following happened. 

A customer approached the doors, and finding them locked before our normal closing time, started banging on them.

Coworker: (shouting through the locked door) We're closed, sir. Due to the blizzard.

Cust: What?! The blizzard isnt supposed to hit for another hour or so! (There was already at least 8 inches on the ground and the winds were at least 40 mph. I really don't want to know what this guy's definition of a blizzard was if that wasn't it.)

Coworker: I'm sorry, sir, but we've already closed the registers and can't open them back up. We'll probably be open again tomorrow as long as the manager can get in.

Cust: But I know what I want! I'll just run in and get it and be out in less than a minute!

Coworker: Like I said, the registers are closed, and we can't reopen them. I'm sorry. 

(My mom at this point is bristling. I can see it in her eyes. She's a mama bear type. Always has been and always will be.)

Cust: (starts calling us every name under the sun) I drove out in this because you guys were supposed to be open til midnight and like a bunch of pansies, you're closing early?! This is Chicago! No one closes early for a little snow! (He's right, no one closes in Chicago for snow. Except when it's a blizzard.)

My mother has had it at this point. She walks right up to the glass and starts screaming at the guy. Everyone left in the store could hear it as, I'm sure, all the employees in the other businesses in the strip mall could.

Mom: My daughter is in there, along with the sons and daughters of many other mothers! They need to get home, safe, and out of this weather! Anything that's going to delay my baby, or any of the other babies in here, getting home in a blizzard is going to have to go through me first!

The guy didnt say another word, turned around, and trudged back to his car. Smart move on his part. He lived to see another day. I love my mom. All of my coworkers loved my mom after that evening as well.",TalesFromRetail

t3_cyjras,HELP MY Poor Husband !,"I currently work a service desk, seeing, hearing, witnessing totally over the top coo coo crazy behavior is nothing new, last night I had a TOPPER , a literal cherry that will sit on the top of my crazy cake until the ""next one.""

I answer the service desk phone to find a woman who opens the conversation with ..""My Husband is in the store I am calling from home, he called me &amp; he is lost. He was told to go the the back of the store to find moving boxes, he's looking for a sofa box and he can't find it. I know I saw them there ,the last person I talked to told me you had them."" 

My head...""A sofa sized box? A box?  Ummm NO lady.""

What I say is  ""I am sorry but I do not believe we have boxes large enough to fit a sofa , we have plastic bags large enough to fit a mattress but we do not have sofa sized boxes in store.""

Her: ""I just spoke to some one else who said YOU DID have them and my poor husband is lost, and can't find them. I want YOU to go find my husband &amp; help him, now.""

Me: ""I am sorry I can do an overhead &amp; have some one from the department meet him but I can not leave the desk, our moving supplies are located on the back wall in bay 13,  please ask him to stay where he is and some one will be there shortly.""

I hang up &amp; call the department who says they are on the way. 

A few minutes later I get a call from the same Woman who says her husband just called her &amp; he's walked from toilets to lighting -he has not seen any sofa sized moving boxes, there is no one any where to help him. FYI I asked her to tell him to stay put....but......She again tells me her ""poor husband"" is lost in the back of the store &amp; demands I leave the desk to find him....( as if he's lost in the forest with blind folds on &amp; maybe 12 years old AT BEST.)

Me: ""Ma'am I can not leave the desk. I have called for assistance for your husband, please ask him to stay where he is &amp; some one will be there shortly. I am sorry he appears to be looking for something we do not have in the store""

Her: "" Are you customer service? What the hell is your job? My husband is in the back of the store, no one is there. He is lost....LOST and alone!! My poor husband is ALL alone.""

I am trying to reassure her some one is on the way to help while letting her know we DO NOT have sofa sized boxes. She is screaming at me about her poor lost husband &amp; how much I suck. At this point I am 20 minutes into this woman &amp; we have actual people staring at me in line wanting help...one of my co-workers comes up behind me &amp; say ""Opps !"" as she presses the hang up button - disconnecting me from the screaming MotherWife in mid-conversation.

My first thought is DAMN IT !

 She has my name !! 

To be honest I am glad to be out of the endless MotherWife spiral &amp; her clueless Husband who keeps calling his wife instead of staying put or asking for help himself. I start helping customers in line ...sure enough a few minutes later she calls back , a coworkers sees her name on the caller ID &amp; simply transfers it to a MOD.

Long story short she made a complaint on me for hanging up on her &amp; not being helpful. My manager goes to the back of the store...finds her wandering little lost husband....after a few minutes of conversation my MOD says ""We do not have sofa sized boxes"" The husband says....""Oh did my wife call you ?

They're curved a few steps up so you can't see around the corner as you're coming back down them, meaning if anything/anyone is obstructing the stairs at the bottom, you're not going to know until you're basically falling over them when you're on the way back down.

I needed to go upstairs. A middle aged woman and her 2 grandkids were sat in a line on the stairs, leaving a couple of inches on the one side free for people to try to pass by. I told her, ""Sorry guys, you can't sit on the stairs. It's a fire exit and it's dangerous because someone could fall over you.""

She immediately got snappy with me and said, ""I'm sure we'd move if there was a fire, love!"" I said that's fine but it's still a health and safety issue so you can't stay sitting there. She yelled and said I was being ridiculous, then stood up from the stairs. I headed up the stairs to get the thing I needed. She sarcastically told the kids as I started to walk, ""Let's stand up and as soon as that's woman's gone we'll sit back down."" As I got to the top of the stairs and out of view she yelled ""JOBSWORTH!""

t3_cyh93q,"""No that's not turquoise""","So this happened a few weeks ago, and I was so dumbfounded by this encounter that my brain almost shut down. It begins with a woman coming up to my register while I was working the cigarette aisle. C will be customer and M will be me.

&gt; C: I'd like a pack of American Spirit Turquoise.

That was the first thing said to me. No hello or anything like that, so this should have been my first red flag.

&gt; M: Okay I'll get that for you ma'am.

So I go to grab the pack of cigarettes. To anyone that's never seen a pack of American Spirit Turquoise, not only are they the color turquoise, but they also say turquoise in pretty plain letters on the pack.

So I show her the cigarettes to confirm it's the right pack, as I always do.

&gt; M: Are these the ones ma'am?

&gt; C: No I said the turquoise ones.

&gt; M (dumbfounded): These are the turquoise ones.

&gt; C: No, turquoise is light blue.

&gt; M: But it says turquoise on the box.

&gt; C: No, I want the light-blue ones.

She said that last line with a rude-sounding tone as though she felt she was dumbing herself down to my level. At this point, I knew I had to check her out before my brain shut down, so I grabbed the light-blue pack and asked her if that was right. She said yes, I scanned it, she paid, and I sat there contemplating my life decisions that led me to that point while I checked out the next customer, who looked just as dumbfounded as I probably did.

tl;dr: Customer wanted turquoise color pack of cigarettes, but didn't know what color turquoise was. Walked out with light-blue pack instead because she wouldn't listen to me.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cyb0yz,“I’m Calling Corporate Because You Used Your Radio”,"This was about two/three years ago when I still worked Loss Prevention at a large store that sold designer things for cheap.

It was the morning, so we only had one cashier, the Front End Supervisor (FES), until the next one came in at 10:30. We had opened at 8:30 and already had about ten people waiting to come in, so you can see the issue.

The only other people besides the FES and myself, were two associates each assigned to the fitting rooms (one on the first floor and one on the second floor), and two managers. The managers were in the stockroom dealing with a large shipment that the stock team wasn’t able to finish, so they were trying to get everything tagged and ready to go out.

Being the only Loss Prevention there, I was assigned to be by the door to watch for potential shoplifters (customers that avoided making eye contact with me when I greeted them, large empty bags that were open, customers near tall racks just staring at me or the cashiers). I noticed that by 9, there was already a line of about seven people waiting to be rung up.

One customer was third in line for purchases, and calls over to me.

Customer: “Can you call for another cashier please?”

I nod, and immediately used my radio headset to ask our managers if they were able to help with the line. Our store manager responded with a “No”. Our FES is a very fast cashier and had managed to get to the customer that had asked for help in five minutes.

As soon as she was done, the customer walked right up to me and asked me for my name. I told her my name and this is what she said:

Customer: “I’m going to call corporate, because you were so rude to ignore me.”

I responded that I didn’t know what she meant.

Customer: “You didn’t ask for another cashier. You ignored me.”

I told her that I didn’t ignore her, that I asked our managers if the could help with the line. My radio headset is very noticeable, and I motioned to it.

Customer: “I didn’t hear you ask anyone! I didn’t hear an announcement!”

No joke, she actually thought I could only asked for help using the announcement system. I told her I used my radio, which doesn’t connect to our PA system and our manager had no one else that could help.

She scoffed and left. I never heard back about what happened so I assumed she didn’t call

t3_cyisyp,“I need the water more!”,"This just happened a few hours ago. I reside in North Carolina and with Hurricane whatever it’s called forecasted to hit us, the store has been busy with people buying water, bread and nonperishables. There’s one of the CSM’s walking up to each of us at the registers and telling us that we can only sell 3 cases of water bottles per person. Pretty much on cue (queue?) here comes a lady with two kids (probably early teens) in tow ,with 5 cases of the bottled water in their buggy. I suppose she collected them before the limit was put down (there was an employee telling customers in the water aisle they can only purchase 3). I tell her; 

Me- “I’m sorry ma’am, you can only purchase 3 of the cases of water.”

L- “What? Wait, what? Why?”

Me- “With the storm approaching, they set the limit so that there’s more to go around for others.”

L- “But what does it matter if I’m paying for it?”

Me- “It just so that it means there’s more people can buy water they might need” 

L- “I need the water too. So why can’t I have it?”


Me- “The limit is just so that there’s more water to go around.”

L- “But I need the water more!”

At this point the woman wiping tears from her eyes with her sleeve

Me- “I apologize ma’am, however if you return tomorrow I’m sure there will be more to go around. It’s just at the moment we can only sell 3 cases per group.” 

L (sniffling)- “Ok I guess that works” 

I ring up her water and other items, give her her receipt and tell her to have a good night. 

The lady was really sweet and I suppose just didn’t understand exactly why there was the limit. It’s hard for me to explain but I felt that they actually did need the water more than others. No mean customer, no real drama, just a nice lady who just seemed to be looking out for her family. I genuinely felt bad for having to deny her the water. I hope to see her tomorrow.

UPDATE: I ran into again today as I walked in to start my shift. She had some groceries in her cart, greeted me and said that when she got home, she and her husband deducted that not only did they not need 5, but they didn’t even need 3. She said that they only really could’ve used 2. So she was there to return one of the cases and buy some groceries.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cycdyr,Tales from the bakery: The greatest heist in retail history,"Hi. Some of you may remember the post I made 4 months ago, about the guy who bricked his phone by smashing a bun inside of it, before calling my bakery and demanding a new phone. Yeah well, I said that I had more amazing stories, and this is going to be one of them.

For those who didn't read the previous post; [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/bafn0m/one_man_three_buns/) it is. Basically I work in a small bakers department inside of a supermarket downtown. It's a decent job. Usually boring, but sometimes we see unbelievable s\*\*\*. Enter: *Tales from the bakery*

Okay, so. This was a pretty ordinary day about 7 or 8 months ago. I was working my weekly shift, and I had around an hour left or so.

As I'm assisting customers, I notice an extremely drunk guy entering the store through the front entrance. As far as I'm concerned he wasn't harassing anyone, and behaved politely apart from the occasional loss of balance when he walked. He goes through the automatic doors and into the main supermarket and I didn't think more of it.

Around 20 minutes pass, and I finally get a bit of a breather from all the customers. As I'm drinking a glass of water, I look back over at the main entrance, and I start to notice that the people walking in appear to be looking strangely at something on the other side of the entrance. This, however, is out of my line of sight, and I assume that they're just looking at something normal.

**Until.** A large, strangely familiar man enters my line of sight, and appears to be heading the wrong way out of the main entrance. Now, our doors are automatic, and only open from one side. This means that in order for him to get out the wrong way, he had to wait for customers entering and then bail out the door before it closed again. The man is walking at an extremely slow pace, almost like he's dragging something.

I look over at the customer service desk, trying to get a hold of their attention, and I notice that they were looking through the surveillance cameras. I walk over to them and say ""Hey guys. Some guy is heading out of the entrance the wrong way."". They then turn around, facing me, looking a bit perplexed and reply ""Uhhh, yeah, some guy also just pissed all over the electronics department, and we're missing a 50' inch TV""

**Oohhf\*\*\***

I do a complete 180, faster than I've ever done before. I look back at the entrance, and there he is. F\*\*\*\*\*\* soaked with urine, from feet to his belly. Wearing a black bowlers hat and a large beige jacket. And in his hands, dragging across the urine soaked floor? A 50' f\*\*\*\*\*\* inch TV. The guy is f\*\*\*ing wasted. And he's taking all the time in the world. Dragging the TV through the entrance at a maximum speed of around 1 mph, while trying to maneuver past the dozens of customers looking at him like he just fell down from space. He is taking all the time in the f\*\*\*ing world.

I look back at the customer service representatives, trying to decode their facial expression because I myself am at a loss for words. They look at the man, then at me, then at the man again, all while carrying an expression on their face that instantly confirmed that **this had never happened before.** They quickly grab the phone and call the head manager. Within 15 seconds, the manager comes storming out, over to the customer service desk. So far, the bandit has only moved around half way out of the entrance, so the manager has enough time to get him.

When confronted by the manager, the man appears to have little to no understanding of what he was doing. He is now carrying the same facial expression as the people walking past him at the entrance. He looks at the TV like it came from the sky, claiming to not really know where it came from. The manager is having none of it, and tries escorting him into the back office. He ends out getting help from another customer, due to the man not really being able to keep his balance. They enter the back office and I turn my head, looking at the customers at the entrance. Everyone has that facial expression now. Nobody understands what the f\*\*\* just happened.

2-3 minutes pass, and the police now enter the store. They head though the front entrance, trying their best to avoid the piss soaked spots just like every other customer has had to do, and head for the back office. I assumed that this was the last that I would see or hear of the TV bandit, but boy was I wrong.

Another 15 minutes pass, and the piss has now been mostly cleaned up by some poor customer service rep. I am handling customers as always, when I see the manager heading towards my bakers department. I look him in the eyes and I see: absolutely nothing. My usually happy manager is f\*\*\*\*\*\* dead inside. Completely emotionally obliterated. He looks at me and says ""Anon... Gloves... I... I need some"". I hand him the gloves and ask him what's going on, but he just turns his back and walks to the back office, looking like he has absolutely nothing left to live for.

Then, after another 20 minutes... The man emerges. Carried by two policemen, with his pants undone, no shoes and a big f\*\*\*\*\*\* grin on his face. Behind them is my manager. Carrying a bag of:

**Literal s\*\*\*, mixed with underwear and a pair of shoes.**

Turns out; when the man was escorted to the back office and met by two policemen, he cursed a bit at them before taking a s\*\*\* on the floor as the police were trying to interrogate him. My poor manager was the one who had to clean it up. And now, having emptied both his blatter and bowel inside of the store, and lost the last remaining bit of his balance, all he was physically and mentally able to do, was to put on a big smile as he was being dragged out of the store. And you wanna know the most f'ed up part? He looked complete. The look of a man who regrets nothing.

**Tl;dr** An insanely drunk guy went to the supermarket I work at. Pissed in the electronics department. Stole a 50' inch flatscreen TV. Tried to drag it casually out of the entrance. Claimed he didn't know where it came from when he was confronted. Got escorted to the back office before finally taking a s\*\*\* on the floor and being dragged out by two officers all while smiling like the happiest man in the world.

I have to this day never seen or heard from the TV bandit. But whereever you might be, I salute you for carrying out the greatest heist in all of retail history.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cy75dx,THAT'S STATE LAW!,"So I work at a liquor store in my hometown and had quite the interesting exchange with an older couple a few weeks ago.

To set up this happened on a Sunday afternoon probably 30 minutes before we were about to close. The store was packed and we only had one register opened as the other one was being counted down. Enter the older couple.

They search around the store for a few minutes occasionally asking me questions about the products and they finally come to thier decision. I ring up all of thier items and give them their total. 

After I give it to them they seemed shocked that it was as high as it was. (They got a two 6-packs and a big bottle of scotch.) 

Husband: ""Well that can't be right."" 

Me: ""Ummmm let me see. Yes sir $79.99 for the scotch and the six packs are both 9.99""

Wife:""Oh well this bottle is marked at 15.99.""

M:"" Oh hang on let me check."" It was the only one of those bottles to be marked at that price as we make out price tags for each bottle individually. 

M: ""I'm sorry about that mix up. I can give you 15% off the bottle if you still want it.""

W: ""I thought you had to give it to me at the price it was marked?"" 

M: ""I'm sorry ma'am but we have a store policy that if it's mismarked more than $15 I can only give you 15% off. If it was under $15 I could give it to you at the marked price.""

H: ""No you have to give it to me at 15.99. I'm the customer and the customer is always right.""

M: "" I'm very sorry sir but if you still want the bottle I can give it to you for 15% off."" 

H:""NO! YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT TO ME AT THE MARKED PRICE! THAT'S STATE LAW""!

W:"" Yeah that's state law!"" 

M: ""Well I've never heard of that state law but I can't give it to you at 15.99.""

H: ""Well then I'm gonna need your name and your name"" (my coworker had come back from counting the drawer) ""Your bosses name and the number of this store.""

I comply and give him the info he was asking for and they went on their way out the door without the 2 six packs that they wanted. 

""I'm gonna own this store by the end of the week"" he yells as he walks out the door. So I carry on with the 15 minutes left we are open taking care of the rest of the customers who were so polite to wait the 10 minutes this was going on. 

After we close the store and lock the doors I go to put up the bottle of scotch that he wanted and wouldn't you know it. Sitting right next to the bottle wanted was a cheap 15.99 bottle of brandy that had a sticker marked 79.99. I laugh quietly to myself as I switch the stickers back and put the bottle back on the shelf. 

As you can probably infer we never heard back from them and the store is still under the same ownership it was.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cycs32,This Is The Last One.,"I work at a family owned nationwide company, that is listed as a hardware store, but we really sell everything from food to toys, homeware, and most everything in between.

This week, while I was stocking the shelves in our kitchen department, an older lady appears right behind me brandishing a tube of filler from our DIY section. (the sections are adjacent)

Random Lady: 'THIS IS THE LAST ONE!'

Me: 'Excuse me?'

RL: 'THIS IS THE LAST ONE ON THE SHELF.'

Me: *utterly bewildered at what she hoped to achieve with this interaction.* Okay.

RL: 'OKAY! SHEESH, ALL YOUR ATTITUDES ARE THE SAME!'

She left after that. She didn't greet me, or ask if there were anymore available, she stalked up to me in an entirely different section and shouted at me about it being the last one. I still haven't figured out if she was trying to help me replenish the stock, or wanted another... But I'm pretty sure she complained to someone upstairs as she left.

Given the lack of clues for what she wanted, I had no idea how to respond to this random lady screeching at me. Trying to remember that okay, isn't the correct response.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cyf7qi,Oh speedo man *funny story*,"Okay I work in a gas station. Not exactly ""retail"" but it kinda counts right? 

Anyways. I come in for my 2pm shift. I'm here maybe 10 minutes before I see a guy ride in on a pump. He's older, very tan and as the title would suggest, in a speedo. Yay.

He comes in to use the restroom. Great. People kinda snicker because this is a very hick town and it's just not something you see. We find out later speedo guy, who is actually very nice, just spacey, isn't from here. SHOCKER.

He comes out of the restroom and gets ahold of my coworker to let her know that he's in need of help and that he's shoved his credit card INSIDE the receipt slot and not the card slot on the pump. Fantastic. We are both relatively new, she hired in a few weeks before me and I've been here less than a month and we aren't trained how to handle these situations. So she goes out with him and finagles with the pump. Calls the manager, finds the key to open the receipt slot. Nothing. They can't find it. The guys wanting to take the WHOLE ASS PUMP APART and my coworker is like no? I'll get in trouble. Don't do that. Don't even mess with it I've got it.

She comes back in to call another manager who had to come back to work but within 2 seconds the card was out and all was good. But inside the store, people are howling with laughter, taking pics, etc. I felt bad because the guy really didn't seem all there. He told me later that he had been in a wreck and should have died but lived and I said ""hey you're still here that's what matters."" He was nice and apologized profusely but yeah. Been a weird day.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cycuda,Soiled clothing on my checkout counter,"So this story begins with a physically disabled homeless individual in a wheel chair coming to my checkout stand with a large amount of items. I did my best to get him checked out as expediently as possible while remaining polite, as the stench coming from him was something awful,  as the individual had clearly at some point soiled/urinated on himself. 

&amp;#x200B;

After I finish checking him out, he asks if he could leave his merchandise with me while he picks up a prescription and trys on some new clothes before purchasing them. I stash his merchandise in an area for that under the counter, while he goes to the outside pharmacy window. After about thirty minutes he comes back into the store and grabs several items of clothing, and goes into the restroom to try them on. Fortunately they fit him (I'm not sure what we would have done had they not and he tried putting them back where he found them, short of disposing of them), and he grabbed a few more to buy.

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm checking out the clothing the clothing he now wants to purchase, and when I'm finished he grabs his old, soiled, wet clothing and drops it onto my checkout stand and asks me to put into a plastic bag for him. I'm at this point about ready to break down and cry, as I struggle with an extreme inability to handle dirty/unclean objects as such. I turn to a coworker, and she whispers to me to have him do it himself. I grab a plastic bag and tell him store policy prevents me from handling personal possessions. There really isn't a policy like that... I just couldn't bring myself to handle something like that. After he finally leaves the store (I made sure to get him his merchandise from earlier) I probably spent a good ten minutes with my checkout stand closed as I repeatedly washed/disinfected everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Adding to the story, I had the next day off, so I didn't get to witness it, however according to my manager he came back the next day shirtless, tried on a shirt, and wandered out with it without paying., and was banned from the store.",TalesFromRetail

This just happened to me and my mind is blown by the stupidity of some people. See, I work as a pharmacy tech and this lady comes up to the register. I come up to her and ask if she was picking up a medication or dropping off a prescription. Here’s basically how it went down:

Lady: I need you to fix this for me. *plops down a broken bracelet*

Me: Ma’am, I don’t know how to fix broken jewelry, and we don’t fix jewelry here.

L: You guys used to do it though. 

M: I’ve been here for a year and we’ve never had services like that. If we had one, you might want to ask someone in the front store for information. 

L: Why can’t you help me?

M: I don’t know how to help you. I’m a pharmacy tech. I deal with medications not jewelry. 

L: So you can’t fix it?

M: No, ma’am. I’m sorry, you’re at a pharmacy, not a jewelry store. 

L: Oh, ok *walks away*

I stood there, baffled. I couldn’t quite believe what just went down. I don’t know. I just had to share this. I don’t know...

EDIT: It’s not a medical bracelet. It’s a charm bracelet you can find in Pandora stores, just to clarify.

EDIT 2: My store had always been a pharmacy. Used to be a mom-and-pop pharmacy before an infamous corporation bought the place and expanded. The manager at the front store said they never offered repair services of any kind in the 10 years she had been working there. So I’m still baffled by the mistake.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cyelk5,Customer treats us like we are invisible.,"This actually happened yesterday, and I want to post this before my shift today:

I was up at the front, greeting customers as they come into our store from the mall. Since it c an get busy in waves, I usually fold up in front and greet and explain sales as they come in. For the most part, I hate this task because it gets repetitive, but what can you do.

What bothers me most about this is not customers saying ‘just looking’ or ‘I’m just browsing’, it’s the ones that straight up ignore me, like this fine fellow:

Me: Hey there, welcome to -insert store name here-

Customer: *obvious knock-off Beats headphones on, ignoring me*

Me: *notices they have the headphones on and goes up to get there attention* What are ya looking for today?

Customer: *notices me and sees me actually trying to talk to him, ignores me and walks right past me*

At this point, I see he has went to my co-worker’s zone (since I need to stay up front), so I figure she can try to make first contact. Nope! This guy is acting like none of us exist. He then storms out, in what seems a frustrated fashion because we didn’t have whatever it was he was looking for.

I give up on trying to figure out this enigma of a customer and go back to greeting and shame-folding in front of customers.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cy2zlg,Lady is wrong and can’t accept it.,"I work in retail at a pharmacy drug store chain. Had a lady that was wrong and did everything in her power to prove she was right. 

The story starts by this lady walking into our store. She looks around slightly confused and then looks at me who was standing being the counter. 

She’ll be WL=wrong lady I’ll be M=Me

WL: you guys moved the whole store around huh? The pharmacy used to be in that corner of the store (points to the opposite corner of the store) 

M: No ma’am! This store has been the same since it’s been constructed! 

WL: No, that can’t be right. You definitely reconstructed it recently. 

At this point I really didn’t know how to respond without coming off as rude. She was wrong and wasn’t accepting the fact. 

M: Well, I’ve been at this store for a year and it’s been the same! The building was constructed for the pharmacy to be where it is, it wouldn’t be possible to move it from one end to the other! Are you sure you aren’t confusing another location? 

WL: No, I’m not. 

M: (drawing a blank) Well, okay!

WL: So you did reconstruct. Why would you lie to me? 

M: I’m sorry ma’am. I know the store has been the same since it opened and don’t know what to say. I apologize if you think I’m lying to you. 

WL: there’s just no need to lie about something so simple. 

The lady then walked off and looked annoyed. When she went to the register to pay she asked the cashier to speak to a manager and they paged me up. Once the lady realized I was the manager she let the cashier know she changed her mind and walked out. The cashier told me she wanted to complain about me lying to her.

t3_cy54sz,You're Killing the WHALES!!,"A bit of context for this one is needed. I just got into doing ecospheres/terrariums. I'd done research and there's a way to keep brine shrimp (aka ""sea monekys"") in an enclosed one if done right. I loved this idea and my older brother had shown interest in it too, and I was thinking of making a  brine shrimp ecosphere for him and myself. 

Anyways, I was at the register talking about my new idea to customers off and on. I was talking to one lady about brine shrimp and she was super interested in what I had to say when the guy behind her pipes up.   


Man: ""You can't do that.""

Man: ""The whales are dying out because you're stealing all their food.""  


At this point I'd finished up ringing up the woman and she quickly grabbed her stuff and scurried off. I started ringing the guy up who was giving me a nasty glare like I'd just drop kicked his puppy.   


Me: ""Sir, the type of shrimp I'm talking about, they're raised in captivity. They lay two types of eggs, one of them called cysts, that have to be dried THEN soaked water before they can hatch. They can last up to 50 years, probably until conditions are better for the shrimp to thrive.""  


Man: -brow narrows and his frown goes deeper at this new information-  


Me: ""The shrimp I'd be talking about were bred in captivity."" (Sidenote: Brine shrimp do exist in the wild. Cysts are also what are used to hatch the renowned sea monkeys.)  


Man: ""You shouldn't  be telling people that. You're going to kill all the whales off if you're taking their food!"" -gives me another nasty glare, snatches his stuff up, and storms off after paying-  


Me: ..... -proceeds to tell the next person in line how brine shrimp swim in weird ways according to the orientation of light-

t3_cy0iji,"""Are you thick? Hurry up!""","TLDR at the bottom.

I've been working at a national sports retailer in the UK for about 2 months now and we have a rather large shoe department. It's currently our ""Back to school"" week and our busiest period. As such staff from other departments have been sent into help. Problem is these staff either don't know how to find a shoe in our rather large stock room or simply take far too long. Somehow even though I've only been working 2 months I was deemed the most experienced person by management and placed as the stock room boy. It was my job to tidy it up, but mainly to grab any shoes that are radioed through to me from the 5 customer assistants outside.

I was starting to get quite good at it, running all over the place and finding each pair of shoes in around 20 seconds. But around 1PM we started to get super busy and all of a sudden all 5 of my colleagues radioed through 2-4 pairs each! It became super overwhelming, each shoe has a 6 digit code, a 2 digit colour code and then the size they want. There is only so many numbers I could remember in my short term memory and I'm trying my best to control the flow of request asking only one person at a time for a single code. When I get onto one of my new colleagues in the confusion I thought she was asking for a Nike shoe. Yet when I went to the Nike walls, I couldn't find the shoe ending in the code she wanted (but the code wasn't entirely wrong for a Nike branded shoe.) Some of our shoes are kept on the table stock outside the stock room and I say I believe it's table stock. Yet she's adamant it's in here. So dripping in sweat I decide to leave the stockroom to see the shoe myself, only to find the kid wearing not a pair of Nikes but ""Kickers""; which also start in the same ID code range. I immediately apologies for the misunderstanding but his dad then says something along the lines of ""Are you thick? How on earth do you miss-hear Nike for Kickers, they sound nothing alike. We've been waiting ages hurry up!""

I just wanted to scream back at him, here's the stock room door, if you think you can find it any quicker go ahead! But thought it best not to respond and just ran back into the stock room to grab his shoes. I couldn't quite believe his audacity, firstly he can't of been waiting longer than 5min (a few min for me to get on to him and then a few min of me searching for a non-existent Nike) and my colleague serving him had a radio of her own so he must of been able to of also heard the barriage of shoe requests I was inundated with or at least see me throwing piles upon piles of shoes out the door!

t3_cxrugs,I WANT MY BROWNIES AND CHEESE!!!,"Amazing start to my shift!

I get to my register, open it up, and the first customer comes rolling in. I noticed this customer had 5 boxes of Betty Crocker *Favorites* and a LOT of cheese. I go on autopilot and being scanning... when she clears her throat.

&gt; Customer: Those brownie mixes are supposed to be $0.50 each. Your register is saying it's $2.49. Where's the discount you displayed on your door?

&gt; Me: I-I'm sorry??

*Completely brand new on the register and had no freakin' clue what she was talking about.*

&gt; Customer: Did you not see your own sign?!

&gt; Me: One second, ma'am.

I began looking around frantically for someone to help me. I had no idea what was going on, what discount she was talking about, or what to do in this situation. When the bagger clocked in and saw my frantic look, he rushed over.

&gt; Bagger: Is something wrong?

&gt; Me: Apparently there's a discount on the Betty Crocker mixes? The register isn't showing that discount.

&gt; Bagger: *turns to face the customer who is looking like it's the end of the world* Do you have a rewards card?

&gt; Customer: NO! And I don't want one! I just want my discount! You have it on a sign out front!

&gt; Bagger: That might be bad printing on our part. If you look closer at the sign, it says ONLY WITH REWARD CARD.

My GOD if this woman could have gotten any redder, she would've been classified as a tomato and joined the cheeses on her belt!

&gt; Customer: That's unacceptable! You shouldn't print false advertisements!

I again give a look that says ""Please... help meeeeeeeeee"" because I was drawing complete blanks on how to help this woman, and she was starting to scare me a bit.

&gt; Me: Do you want me to void the scans?

&gt; Customer: NO! I want my brownie mix at the price you advertised!

&gt; Me: Ma'am, as Bagger said you will not receive the discount without a card. I'm so sorry for the inconvenience.

&gt; Customer: You're not sorry! I want to speak to your manager!

Had no clue how to page a manager, and my nametag had a tag under it that said I was NEW, so Bagger went to get a manager.

&gt; Me: I'll just set these aside and scan the rest of your items until he gets back.

I grab a pack of cheese... scanned it...

&gt; Customer: Where's the discount for the cheese?

&gt; Me: I can only assume it's tied with the card, ma'am.

Just in freaking time! Bagger and the manager came back just as she was about to say something else.

&gt; Manager: Is there a problem?

&gt; Customer: Your damn right there's a problem! Your cashier here is saying I can't get the $0.50 discount on my brownie mix and is now trying to cheat me out of the discount on my cheese!

&gt; Manager: Do you have a rewards card? The discount applies at the end of the transaction if you do.

&gt; Customer: NO, AND I DON'T WANT ONE.

&gt; Manager: Then I'm sorry, ma'am. You will not get the discount without a card. It's completely free to sign up and can be used immediately. EnragedErin has a bunch of them here for any customer who wants a card.

&gt; Customer: I don't WANT a card! Clean out your ears!

My manager CLEARLY did not like that. With a calm inhale, he signaled for me to step aside and cancelled her entire transaction.

&gt; Manager: I'm going to have to ask you to leave. You're holding up the line and starting to become a disturbance to the other customers.

&gt; Customer: I'm not leaving!

&gt; Manager: Yes, you are. *he went to grab the customer's arm to escort her out of the building and turned to look at me before walking away* Sorry about that, EnragedErin. Please ring up the other customers while Bagger puts these items into a return buggy.

While Bagger grabbed the items I had sent to the far end, I looked at the customer that was behind the raging lady. There was that sympathetic grin you could almost tell was a grimace.

&gt; Customer 2: Wow, you really got thrown to the wolves, didn't you?

&gt; Me: Phew... tell me about it. Anyways, I am so sorry for the delay! How's your day so far?

The cashier had done everything in one transaction, explained that the 50% off would be on the lower ticketed items, but also that our register would calculate it so she gets the best deal in one shot. She was seemingly okay with this.

I guess she came back 10 minutes later after \~thoroughly\~ examining the receipt and wanted to return everything so she could then split up the transaction to *actually* get the better deal. I was still hanging around the registers since there was a line now forming because another cashier was also trying to explain to her that she still got the better deal and that she shouldn't split up the original purchase. I'm then called over and I had a quick look at the receipt and asked her if that's really wanted to do. She said yes. The customer is always right, so we spent 10 minutes fixing this ordeal for her while our line just kept growing. 

Once we had some downtime, I compared the old receipt to the new ones. Totaled up, she actually spent $20 more (before taxes and all). Best win of the week.",TalesFromRetail

So I take the cupcakes and shape them into the 9, the frosting gets a little messed up because I had to grab each cupcake individually and it got messy, nbd, it didnt look bad at all.

I remake it how she told me too and give it to her, she said it looked better but now she's mad that I changed the price. For 24 cupcakes it's $13.98 whereas for the cupcake cake it is $18.98. she's mad but still takes it and doesn't even say thank you. 10 minutes later a different manager comes up and starts yelling at me about how rude I was and how bad the cupcakes look.

Apparently, the woman told her I was super rude the whole time and said that I made the cake so horrible and that when asked to redo it I just took a cupcake out of the middle and rolled my eyes and called her a b word under my breath and when I gave it back to her said ""here's your 9 b****!"" None of this happened, at all, i was very nice and patient with her. I will admit the cake looked kinda wonky after the second attempt but that's because I had to keep touching the frosting when I moved them to make the shape. The other manager doesnt apologise for coming at me without asking what happened but my other one gave me a hug and said thats how people are and that it was nice of me to the favor but next time to just say no.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cxnp8m,Asking for the employee discount,"I used to work in retail and in my brief period of 10 month I have made little encounters of horrible customers. 
One case however I remember clearly. 
I worked at an outlet so our prices were lower then usually already it was about fall or winter and we had a lot of warm jackets and the like in store. In my shift a man comes up to me an asks me ""how much of a discount can you give me?"". He didn't even greet me, he didn't say his name, no hello, no friendly smile. 
I politely responded ""Sorry Sir that's already the outlet price and I can't make it cheaper"" 
He answers ""You could give me your employee discount"" I could have for that but it was about to be holiday season and we only get our discount up to a certain amount of clothes bought and I wanted to get some things cheaper for my family, my friends and me and maybe a couple of co-workers who already used the credit they had on their discount card. And all that appart I am not going to give my employee discount to a stranger demanding it on the spot. He continued ""So I only want to spend about thirty to fourty bucks on my new jacket"" (which is very little!) And I tell him politely ""I can't offer you a discount bit if you get a membership card there will be a ten percent discount on your first purchase"" and smiled. He said ""no I don't want that, I want your discount"" I told him once again that I couldn't offer him a discount and he finally moved along.

t3_cxeh69,The coupon stack from hell that even “extreme couponers” would frown upon.,"This is 1) on mobile and 2) 11 years ago. Forgive accordingly.

I was 18, working my first big girl job at your favorite VERY RED retail store. I started in photo, but that went belly up about three months in. Surprisingly, I was offered a management position in guest service/front lanes ... but it basically meant I got .25 more an hour to do the same thing the big guys do for half the pay. But whatever. I liked my job and was pretty good at it.

The cast

Me: new *kinda* manager

Kelly: new cashier

Paula: extreme middle aged couponer gone rouge

I was in the office that had a one way mirror type window, doing paperwork. The lane in front of the window had our new hire. Kelly. She was there for this exact reason. 

I look up from my work to check on her now and then.  I see Kelly looking back and forth, kind of panicked and I calmly walked out to see A METRIC FK TON of coupons stacked in front of her. Kelly tried to scan each one, some working others not. 

Paula flips out each time one doesn’t scan, screaming at this poor girl.

P: JUST SCAN IT RIGHT!

K: I-I’m sorry ma’am, it’s expired it won’t scan...

P: I’m sure there’s some sort of override, just do it.

K: N-no ma’am I honestly can’t, it won’t let me.

Me:  It’s okay Kelly, I’ll take over. Ma’am this is a large stack of coupons you have. The ones she can’t scan are expired and are manufacturers coupons. There’s genuinely nothing we can do with them or they’re ours but they don’t apply to your items.

P: I’m pretty sure you’re lying but I have places to be.... what about the rest?!

(Mind you this is about 25+ coupons at least)

Me, looking through the massive pile, sorting expired and irrelevant coupons: Okay ma’am. You have 3 valid coupons left. It brings your total to $xx.xx.

P: YOU’VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. I double checked each of those coupons!

Me, gesturing to both piles I made while sorting: these are expired... many by quite a while. This other pile are ones that don’t apply to any of your items. I know it’s frustrating, but I have to follow policy not just for the store, but for the manufacturers. 

P: (I’m pretty sure you know what she said)

Me: ma’am... I am the manager. That’s why I came out here to sort this out. 

P: I don’t believe you , you’re just a kid! Get me the real manager!

Me, gesturing to my name badge: I am indeed the manager of the front end. (She doesn’t know what our acronyms for managers are) I don’t want to be rude, but we cannot accept these coupons. I have throw the expired ones out, but you can keep the others in case they apply to other items in the future. 

P: FINE. Just let me pay so I can leave. And keep your coupons! I’m never shopping here again!

(Awww darn it!)

I finished the transaction, trashed the MOUNTAIN of coupons and turned my newbie. 

Me: This doesn’t happen often (half truth, but I don’t want to spook her) but if you ever feel sketchy about something like this or anything else, flip your light on and stall them. I’ll run over right away, okay?

Kelly nodded and I gave a quick side hug then a thumbs up.  I believe she stayed there till the place closed down. Great gal.

Of course her threat of never coming back was a lie. I saw Paula several times after but never had to put her in her place again. She apparently followed the rules after an 18 yr old told her about herself.

Edit: WOW. This blow up was not expected but thank y’all! 

To clarify a few things... They got rid of the WHOLE photo department altogether (in my store, least. I think some still have them... but mine closed completely a couple years ago anyways, sooooo). It just wasn’t doing well cos not a lot of people in 08 were getting film developed. BUT they liked my work ethic and people skills so instead of letting me go or moving me to cashier, they moved me up.

Again, it was like *barely* a promotion technically. I was an *assistant* assistant manager basically. I made like 8ish dollars an hour. But don’t think that means they didn’t overwork me and task me with things above my pay grade, like this. COS THEY ABSOLUTELY DID, let me tell ya. 

And the rouge/rogue thing? I’m leaving that mistake in there cos the comments about it are side-splitting. Keep going.",TalesFromRetail

One night, I'm on a closing shift. It's around 6PM and I'm working with this obnoxious new girl (been a few months) and we don't really get along well. We settle for just not talking to each-other as much as possible and getting through the night. The door opens, and in walks an older hippie lady.

She's got waist length grey hair, bell bottom jeans, a bright tie-die shirt, and large purple sunglasses.

Obnoxious Girl is at the counter next to me and lady walks up and asks about changing her oil, and then about tires for some reason (which we didn't even sell). I recommend one brand, Obnoxious Girl recommends a different one. We then argue back and forth for a minute about which is better.

At the end of the argument, Hippie Lady, pulls her sunglasses down her nose and looks over them at us.

Hippie Lady: What, are you two married?

Me and Obnoxious Girl both stare at her in shock, and then both scoff and laugh.

Me: To her?!

OG: To him?!

Hippie Lady laughs and turns around, gets her oil change, and leaves. OG and I laugh about it a little bit, and then get back to work and mostly ignoring each-other.

t3_cxrfrp,That time I accidentally a shopping cart with soda in it.,"Hello TFR, long time no see. I'm still out of the retail business, but this story from my early days at my old job popped into my head and I thought I'd share it here.

During the early years, one of the worst customers I remembered was what one could consider to be a Karen. Yeah, she was just that entitled. I had two encounters with Karen, one where she came storming into the back room demanding a manager, and another that is the main focus of this post. Karen had lost her temper with the pharmacy department. I assume she couldn't get her pillz for some reason, but she had completed a transaction that included a 12 pack of Diet Cherry Pepsi cans. She demanded that someone bring the cart out to her car, as she was either unable or unwilling to push it out of the store herself. Guess who drew the short straw.

So I go along, and as I tried to bring the cart down off the sidewalk and onto the asphalt of the parking lot, something happened that I can't explain. I swear it wasn't intentional, but I lost control of the shopping cart and it flipped over, causing the 12 pack to make contact with the ground. Understand that if it was intentional, I'd be taking credit for my actions, not accepting responsibility. Karen witnessed this. I picked up the cart, and brought it to her trunk where we both noticed the 12 pack was leaking. One or more of the cans burst upon impact. I explain to Karen that she can get another one at no additional cost and no questions asked. The only problem is that Karen was very particular, she wanted Diet Cherry Pepsi, and that turned out to be our last 12 pack. She was furious and demanded to speak to the manager. Manager shows up, and she demands I be fired for my mistake. Manager chooses instead to stick up for me, since he knew me well enough to know that it's better if angry customers just leave, and I wouldn't have done this to her on purpose. Ultimately Karen left without even a refund, she was that angry. Never saw her again.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cxibx4,The Smellies,"Back in the early 90s I worked for a while as a 'weekender' at a well-known 'posh' UK supermarket in a small village in Hampshire.


There were many regular customers but the most notable were a couple who always seemed out of place in the surroundings. Filthy clothes, tattered shoes, matted, unwashed hair (and beard on the male half) and a pervasive whiff of peat bog and stale urine. They looked and behaved like Quentin Blake's illustrations from Roald Dahl's 'The Twits' made flesh and may have been husband and wife, siblings or both. They were imaginatively nicknamed The Smellies.


Every Saturday at about 10am they would shuffle through the door. Senior staff knew to be absent from the shop floor and only assistant section managers and we poor part timers were left to handle them. Most of the time, the trouble was limited to them bickering (Mrs Smelly would mutter something in an unintelligible croak and Mr Smelly would yell 'SHUT IT, YOU RATBAG') or them demanding a product which we didn't sell.


Until the Dark Day which changed one young assistant manager's life forever.


They were ambling about as per usual: 'Mumbly croak' 'SHUT IT' 'Croaky mumble' 'I SAID BUTTON IT' when Mrs Smelly bent down to get something from a low shelf. Mr Smelly grinned, adopted a pose reminiscent of the 'Skegness - It's So Bracing' poster and booted her up the arse. This propelled her face first into the own brand baked beans and she slid to the floor, immobile.


Andy the assistant section manager and I dashed over to help. Andy was one of our trained first aiders and performed the preliminary checks while I called the office upstairs to arrange an ambulance. She was unconscious and didn't appear to be breathing. Andy knew what he had to do. The colour drained from his face.


Mouth to mouth resuscitation. 


There then followed what I can only describe as one of the most heroic acts I've ever witnessed. Andy forged ahead, mouth to distressingly scabbed and bewhiskered mouth while Mr Smelly offered words of encouragement such as 'GET UP, YOU SLAG' while delivering the odd gentle punt to her side. 


The ambulance arrived and they were both spirited away not to be seen for a few weeks after which they returned as if nothing had happened. 


Andy spent a good half hour in the toilets rinsing his mouth. We took him to the pub down the road at lunchtime where three pints of Stella took the edge off it. He sat at the table with the thousand yard stare of a man who has seen too much in his short time. He kept muttering something that has haunted me ever since:

t3_cxki2k,"Sure, I'll lie to my vendor just for you because you're special","Alright, so I'm working at the flooring desk at my big box home improvement store. One of my co-workers has a customer who wants to order a roll of special order carpet to be picked up by her contractor, who will install it. She has a very specific install date picked out and is very insistent on it.

Co-worker calls me over and the lady is asking about how soon the carpet will be in. I tell her that special ordering all of our carpets is a 2-3 week lead time.

""Well, your sign says installed in seven days!""

I explain to her that that lead time is if we're going to install it. Based on how soon we'd get out to her house to measure before the install, there's absolutely no way that we'd be able to get the carpet installed by her preferred date.

""But the sign says seven days!""

I again explain to her that the carpet is guaranteed in seven business days if we're going to install it, and the vendor won't rush the shipping if we're not installing it.

""Well, why can't you just tell the vendor that you're installing it so that they'll rush it?""

It doesn't work that way. First of all, all of our install jobs ship the carpet directly to the installer, not to the store, and they also can see when it's attached to an install order. The vendor would know that it's not being installed by us. Plus, we have contracts with them regarding the rush shipping for install jobs and we can't violate those contracts by lying to them.

""But I'm saving you money since you won't have to pay your installers!""

She's technically right since with our free carpet installation promotion, the payment to the installers does come out of our pocket, not the customer's, but that's irrelevant to the discussion.

I tell her that there's no way for us to get it that fast. It simply can't be done. Unfortunately, the carpets that we carry in the store aren't the same quality as the one she wanted to special order (which was top of the line) so we just didn't have an option for her that would be as fast as she needed.

She got up in a huff and demanded to know where the closest carpet store is. I told her that I didn't know and she stormed off.

**TL;DR: Lady demands that I violate company and vendor policy because she absolutely has to have her carpet by a certain date.**",TalesFromRetail
t3_cxgtqm,Computer mice have a limited number of clicks.,"It's me, your fearless bleeder is back again with another story. I was reminded of this event that took place while talking to old co-worker. Many, many, moons ago, when I was the owner and operator of my own computer store, we had a customer who would always come in, and attempt to show how he knew more about computers than we did. For this story, I will refer to him as Skip. I use this name for anyone I come across who is of limited intelligence on subjects. You know the type; they behave like they are always smarter than everyone else but have no idea what they are talking about. I started using the name mostly due to a friend I knew in high school. I could write several stories about his adventures in Skip land. But I haven’t found the right sub reddit for these yet. Anyway, on to the story.

It was a quiet day at the computer shop. We were getting a lot of repairs done, when who would happen to come in but our favorite customer, SKIP! He has his computer in hand, gently setting it down on the counter. I walk up to the counter and say, 

ME: good morning, I see it’s having problems again, what’s going on this time?

Skip: It’s the CPU, this time.

Me: OH? What makes you think it’s the CPU?

Skip: Every time I click on something, it will take several clicks for it to respond.

Me: Oh, I see. Are you sure it’s not a mouse problem?

Skip: How could it be a mouse problem? You just move the mouse and click on the icons. It’s just not running the programs when I click on things.

ME: Well. I can hook it up and we can see if it has the same problem.

Skip: Ok, but you will see right a way that it’s a CPU problem. I’ve read enough about computer issues to know this is how a bad CPU starts.

I take the computer and hook it up to our evaluation station. Power the unit up and ask him to log in. Once we are at the desktop. I start clicking on icons to open programs. Items are starting and coming up fine. No issues. I asked him. Does it take a little bit of time before the problem starts? Skip is standing behind me, wondering why everything is working.

Skip: No, its, its been constant. Every time I start the computer it happens. What did you do to fix it?

Me: You watched everything I did. I honestly think you have a bad mouse. The button is likely failing, which is why it’s not working every time.

Skip: I don’t believe that’s the real reason.

Me: Skip, you can see its working fine here. Sit down and give it a try.

Skip proceeds to move to the chair and starts opening and closing programs. Becoming more and more agitated that the problem has gone away.

I walk over to my parts shelf and grab a mouse out of the bin. And place it on the counter.

ME: I have this 5-dollar mouse. You are welcome to return it if you find out it doesn’t resolve the problem when you get it back home.

Skip: I still don’t see how it would be a mouse problem. But I will give it a try.

I power off his system, unhook the PC, and complete the transaction for the new mouse. I didn’t see Skip for a few weeks after that. When he came in the next time. I asked him how the new mouse was working. He just mumbled something and then asked for a new USB stick. So glad I can make a customer happy.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cxkdan,The old switcheroo,"I work at a hardware store. Right now I’m at the returns desk. So when I get in today there is a customer who is doing a very complicated return with a coworker. She has multiple receipts and some items were bought in store and other items were bought online.

In the end she has 10 items that cannot be found on any of the receipts or her credit card. The coworker tries to process those items as a non-receipted return to get the customer a store credit. 

Unfortunately the item is blacklisted. Normally these items are expensive or easily stolen and cannot be returned without a receipt. The coworker explains that and the customer is upset.

At this point I’m totally on the customer side. It sucks that honest people I have to get stuck with items because other people steal. 

Customer asked for a manager. The manager comes up and says that they understand but there is no way to override the system. The customer wants another manager. The store manager was in the building that day and came and told the customer the same thing.

However the manager offers to look into it to make sure it wasn’t an online order. The customer leaves the items and says that when find her online order to credit her card and give her a call.

Here’s where the script gets flipped. Someone takes a look at the items in question. Like a real look at it. The product was in packaging for let’s call it GatorGrips. However the product inside of it was a half inch PVC elbow. So basically they were trying to return a .40 item for $10.

She says she will be there shortly.

So she shows up about an hour later and shows me pictures of the car, it's probably a total. The cables snapped off the rear driver wheel and whipped around the outside of the car.

As was the case in a bunch of my other stories this takes place in the wonderful 5 years when I worked in a certain supermarket.  This particular story takes place on the most horrible, nerve racking, and anger inducing time of the year; November. It was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, our Black Friday sales hit Thanksgiving day, late into the evening, around 9 or 10 oclock. To save time on the actual day of, they set up the displays for Blackfriday on this particular Wednesday. With everyone going for last minute Thanksgiving supplies, and the clutter this results in a lot of traffic in the aisles, a lot of angry customers, and just a lot of headaches for staff.

&amp;#x200B;

Around this time a customer (Hereto after referred to as EC) comes up to my check out and starts loading things up. The first item I scan is a blanket of some kind, I don't remember exactly. Fleece I think. It comes up at the standard price and the customer immediately catches it.

EC: Hold on! That was supposed to be \[Heavily discounted price\]

Me: \*knowing I won't be able to change it quite that much on my own I immediately call for management, but I know it's going to take a while given how hectic it is\* I'm sorry, but that's not what it says here.

EC: Well what it says there is wrong! It's supposed to be \[Discounted price\] not that!

Me: Well I'm sorry, that's not how it's coming up in the system.

Ec: \*getting red in the face\* Well your system is wrong! You need to fix it right now!

Me: Ma'am, please calm down, I'm trying to get management over here to fix this

EC: Don't you dare tell me to calm down! This is ridiculous! There's so many people here I could hardly move through the store! What the hell is going on here!

Me: Well, ma'am, they're all trying to get their last minute shopping done so they don't have to come in during the holiday tomorrow.

EC: \*scoffs\* That's just stupid! They should've gotten all that done before!

Me: \*can't help but notice she has a cart full of food; cranberry sauce, corn, carrots, some potatoes, butter, pretty much a whole thanksgiving spread save the turkey\* Yeah...I guess...

EC: \*Eyes narrow, seeming to get exactly what I'm thinking but my manager arrives to save me, keep in mind I have a large line growing behind this woman now and the only thing I've scanned is the blanket\*

M: What's going on here?

EC: This BOY refuses to give me the proper price for this!

Me: She's saying it's down to \[Price\] but I knew I'd need approval to get it that low.

M: That doesn't sound right at all...can you tell me where you found it for that?

EC: It's back there! \*She points behind her in a general direction\*

M: \*sighs\* Me, why don't you go follow her to where it is, I'll put this stuff back in the cart and try to take care of the line.

Me: \*thinking she gave me the short end of the stick here, reluctantly nod and follow EC\*

EC: \*takes me through the aisles to one the big red displays that says 'Black friday savings!"" along with the item and the discounted price. We keep these under plastic wrap until just before the actual sale and attached to the plastic wrap on each side is no less than three signs saying ""Do not open until \[sale date\]"". The one she leads me to has a huge rip in plastic wrap\* See! This is where I got it

Me:...Ma'am, did you open this display?

EC: Of course! How else was I supposed to get at it!

Me:....Ma'am, that's for tomorrow's sale, that's why it's wrapped up like that, because it's not meant to be sold at that price today.

EC: \*starting to go red in the face\* Well you really should've had a sign up for it!

“ when will he be here?”

“ I’m not sure but like in 10-20 mins”

“Okay I’ll be back later I need to return something”

So the man goes and the cashier ends her shift and she goes home and I go on the till. 
The mans then comes back and says the same thing so I go and say “ he will be here but would you like to tell me what’s the problem”

He says “ well I bought a bag for £7.99 and it’s completely ripped on the inside. 

I’ve already seen This bag and he’s ripped it himself so then I say” okay do you have a receipt “

“ no I lost it “

So then I say “ we can’t return it” 

This man full on says “ yes you can” 

And I repeat myself.

He gets more annoyed and then says “ where’s the boss. That’s the only person I NEED”

So I say okay I’ll call him and see what he says”

I tell the guy of the mangers decision and this person gets angry and says” I want you to return it now “ 

So I say to him “no I will not return it and are you going to go to an lawyer or something”

He says” I will if you won’t return it”

t3_cx8rcx,I just need a cord!,"I work at an electronic store and about a month ago two older ladies (late 50s early 60s) came in.  They had the deer in headlights look so I went over to help them. Only one lady talked and the other just watched it all unfold. 

Me: Can I help you find anything?

Lady: Yes I am looking for a cord for my TV.

Me: Alright what kind of cord are you looking for?

Lady: A cord that will let me plug it into another device.

I pause for a second thinking what she could mean, dvd player, stereo, etc.

Me: What kind of device?

She pauses and thinks, I assume she isn't very tech savey so I give her some time.

Lady: You know the internet thing

Me: Do you mean a router?

Lady: I don't know probably.

Me: Are you trying to connect it to the internet, is it a smart TV?

She starts to get more frustrated with my questions.  I am trying to be patient and polite because I know a lot of people aren't good with Technology especially older folks.

Lady: Mmmm I don't know someone just told me I needed it.

I explain its probably an ethernet cord.

Me: Is it an ethernet cord, it looks kind of like a phone jack.

Lady: No I don't think so.

I get confused because I am pretty sure that its, I look up some answers and there were some TVs that used coax cables and some that used other different things.  I explained the options and what they looked like but she had no idea. 

Me: Do you have a picture or can you discribe what the plug-in looks like.

Lady: No I don't have a picture

Me: Well I am pretty sure that it is a ethernet cord, if its not you can come back and return it within 2 weeks.

She gets a lot angrier and then yells my favorite response from a customer of all time.

Lady: Look its grey and connects one thing to another!

Her and her friend then make for the exit and leave without saying another word.  I had to pause, I was angry for being yelled at, but also wanted to laugh from her answer.  Inside my head I wanted to take her to our aisle that had a lot of our cords, our hundreds of cords, spread my arms out and yell.

""CONGRATS, YOU JUST DESCRIBED WHAT A CORD IS!""

Was just funny and frustrating, I don't know what she needed and I don't think she knew what she wanted either.  But at least I know what a cord is now.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cx66s8,Impatient customer tries to leave with merchandise after placing a few bills on the counter of a closed register.,"On mobile so apologies for formatting.

This story happened last night. I work at a clothing store in Florida. Everyone is panicking over Hurricane Dorian and gas stations and grocery stores are packed. We only had a few customers in last night, and it was near closing (we close at 9 PM).

I happened to be near the registers at the time (the registers are to the right of the front door) and my co-worker who just started working there recently was ringing up a customer. It was maybe 30 minutes until we were closing. This is around the time that we leave only one register open as it's not too busy out and everyone wants to leave early.

Then comes two male customers waiting behind the lady being rung up. They only had one item: A hat. They were waiting for maybe two minutes, until one of them speaks up. Cue the interaction. IC = Impatient customer.

IC: ""Can you open up a register? We've been waiting for ten minutes."" (They weren't)

Me: ""Unfortunately we have only one register open, sir. She's almost done with the transaction and she'll be right with you.""

IC huffs and looks visibly frustrated.

IC: ""Can you give me change?""

I can see at this point that he's starting to pull out some bills in cash to cover the cost of the merchandise.

Me: ""As soon as she's done with this customer she'll be right with you.""

IC: ""Then open up a register! I've been waiting for 10 minutes already! This is ridiculous!""

Me: ""I apologize, sir, but we have no other registers open. You'll have to be patient.""

IC is fuming at this point and he slams the money down on the counter of a closed register infront of me and then he starts ripping the tag off the hat and starts to leave. I stop him by calling him over.

Me: (laughing internally over how ridiculous this is) ""Sir, I cannot allow you to leave with that. The payment has to be made through the register so the transaction is processed electronically."" (And also to cover my ass because I can get fired for letting him do that.)

IC: ""F*** it, then!"" He takes his money back and slams the hat on the counter and storms out the door.

He did seem pretty drunk but I don't even know what his problem is. He has all the time in the world to get his water, bread, alcohol, whatever he wants to get for this hurricane. I guess he won't have a hat then.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cx7b81,A customer just screamed at me for 20 minutes. Over 90 cents.,"Literally typing this on my lunch break because I am so infuriated and disgusted by this lady, who for obvious reasons, I will be calling “Karen.”

One of my jobs is at a popular Hardware store that I shall not name as per the rules of this sub. However I will mention that I am a seasonal associate and my last shift is tomorrow.

Anyhow, I work as a cashier there and today I was assigned to the lumber register, a register way at the far end of the store and pretty far from everything else.

I was patiently awaiting customers when Karen arrived. She and her husband were buying nine 6-foot deck boards and three 12-foot deck boards. I scanned them in and she noticed they didn’t come up discounted. I flipped through the flyer to see that they are indeed supposed to be discounted for 15% off, it just wasn’t coming up in the system for some reason.

No biggie. This happens more frequently that it should. I’ll just manually override it. Except that wouldn’t work. I got a pop-up on my POS screen stating that because of the store’s relationship with the vendor, they can’t sell the boards for less than full price. I sent for one of the assistant managers and she helped me work around it and override it for the discount. Everything was fine.

Then I went to give her the total and she suddenly stops. She says the 6-foot deck boards were coming up as $6.98 at full price, rather than $6.86. I was confused because with the discount, that should equal $5.93 and I was already giving that to her.

She sends her husband to check and I asked if a lumber associate could verify it. There was a tag that read “$6.86” however not only was it a completely different type of board, it also explicitly states that they are $6.86 minus 10%. Not 15%. $6.86 minis 10% would have rung them up at $6.17. I informed them that what I was giving them for the boards was cheaper than what was labelled on the tag.

However, Karen informs me she wants $6.86 minus 15% rather than 10%. Essentially she wanted me to combine both offers. I politely told her I can’t do that because it’s a completely different item. 

And then the gates of Hell were opened. She started screaming at me, the assistant manager, and the associate with me about not getting her damn discount (even though she was already getting one). She would. Not. Back. Down. All three of us were trying to explain it to Karen only for her to interrupt us and continue screaming about how she’s never coming her again, she’d rather go to our competitor, yada yada yada. I think all of us here have heard it all before. 

This onslaught of demonic screeching went on for close to 20 minutes. While the assistant manager tries to reason with Karen, I pop the numbers into the equation. 

Here’s what I found out:

$6.98 x .85 = $5.93 (Full price in system minus 15%)

$6.86 x .90 = $6.17 (Full price of the incorrect tag minus its listed 10%)

Now I thought let’s pretend I actually gave her the combined offer and gave her $6.86 minus 15% instead of 10%, like she wanted.

$6.86 x .85 = $5.83 (Literally 10 cents less than the discount she was already getting) 

Eventually the assistant manager just gives up and gives her the 15% off of $6.86.

Now referring back to what she was buying, she had 9 of those deck boards. If she was saving 10 cents on each one, she was literally screaming in our faces over 90 cents. *Ninety cents.*

I was so pissed off when she left. The greed of people disgusts me.

I came *this* close to going off and screaming back at her because like I said, my contract is almost over and my final shift is tomorrow. Even if I did scream at her, what are they gonna do? Fire me? 

The worst part was she came back and she had the **BALLS** to ask me to use my measuring tape and stapler to measure the boards and make sure they were correct and to staple on a red flag which you have to legally put on if you’re carrying wood in an open-bedded truck.

She relied "" well it's a rental, and it was one of the medium teir ones"" to which I replied"" I still do not know mam, perhaps you can call the place you rented it from?"".

When this happened, I had worked there for about three months. I knew the items we sold pretty well, but I didn't quite know every shelf like the back of my hand yet. I had already put in a lot of effort to learn the stock, though.

I'm the only employee around when Karen walks in, and our registers are right next to the front doors, so Karen comes up to me.

Karen: ""Where do you keep your beads?""

Me: ""I'm sorry, ma'am. To my knowledge, we don't carry beads.""

K: ""You do. I know you do. My friend told me that she bought beads here before.""

I knew full well that we didn't carry beads, but I didn't feel like getting into it with Karen.

Me: ""If we do, they'll be in \[X aisle\].""

She goes over to that aisle and comes back to my register after a bit -- carrying a few items, none of which are beads.

K: ""You were right, I didn't find any beads.""

Me: ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience."" I continue to ring her up.

K: ""You should really get to know your stock better.""

Now I'm confused. Did she just call me ignorant for correctly telling her that we didn't carry an item??

K: ""Next time you're working, you should come in early, off the clock, to browse the store and familiarize yourself with what you sell.""

I'm fuming, but I knew I'd get in trouble if I defended myself to her. I manage to get out a ""Yes, ma'am,"" but I'm pretty sure I'm turning red in the face.

She walked out, and I spent the rest of the day telling her off in my head.

t3_cx75bn,"""TrAdINg StANdaRdS""","Okay so this happened a while ago but I saw the person the other day and it reminded me of it.

So I worked in a vape shop for about two years, about a year into this job, a customer comes in complaining about a vape saying it is not charging and she can't get a drag off it, she puts it on the counter with the receipt, I pick it up, take one look at it and instantly see another companies branding on the device. 

I place it back down on the counter and explain to her that she didn't buy it from us, straight away she gets defensive and hits me with ""I definitely did buy it from here! Look I've got the receipt!"" Again I explain to her that she bought it from another shop that was down the street. She is adamant that she bought it from us and hit with the ""I want to speak to the manager!"". Funny thing is, I was the person in charge that day, I explain this to her and she suddenly starts to go quiet, now I'm usually a level headed person but she kept up with this whole ""I did buy it from here!"" I literally had to take her outside, show her our company logo compared to the logo on the device. Once realising that she was in the wrong she apologised and left soon after. 

Cut to three weeks later, shes back again with a device she did actually buy from us complaining that its having the same problems, now I worked for a franchise and our company policy was that before we accept a return, we must test it for atleast two hours to find the exact fault. When I explained this to her. She was definitely not happy, demanding her money right then and I kept explaining to her that it's not possible and I'd be risking disciplinary action if I dont follow company policy. She picked the device from the counter, stormed out shouting ""I'm getting trading standards involved"". About five minutes later, she comes back in and asks if we can test it and if theres a shop phone that she can ring and check on the progress. Never saw her again.

t3_cx48n7,"You keep guns behind the counter, yeah?","Contemplated whether or not to post here or not but here we go!

I used to work at a Canadian Tire (Yeah, I'm a Canadian boi) for nearly 2 years. I worked in the sports and tools section, even though I knew jack squat about each but hey, gotta make that cash. Now a little tidbit about Canadian Tire, we didn't all sell firearms for the longest time, and it was nearly after a year of me working there that we finally got our first hunting rifle. We did have an aisle though which had one side consisting of glass cases full of slingshots, paintball guns, airsoft guns and the like, the other side being full of fishing rods.

So this fella decides to show up in this buisnay. If I remember, he had a jacket and hat from Browning and a beard that went down to his chest, with some strands of grey. Probably in his 40's. He was checking out the glass cases and had a face like 'Huh... is this it? That can't be possibly true' so I decided to approach my red shirt ass over and ask the classic proverb 'Need help with anything sir?'

(C)ustomer: Yeah, I got a question for you

(M)e: Sure, what's up?

C: So uh... where do you keep them?

He gave me that look like ""Yeah, you get me, bro?"" as if I was gonna give the fingerguns and be like ""Yeeeeaaaaah man!"" but I had no idea what he meant. Did he not see the cases?

M: \*glances at glass cases\* Uh.. keep these?

C: No no no, where do you keep... the REAL guns?

This is when it hit me; he thought we sold real fire arms. Well, not like he is the first to ask so I gave our normal answer that we didn't sell real fire arms. He actually makes a chuckle, takes a step to me, and practically whispers. Stranger danger!

C: They behind the counter? Maybe in the back?

Wow.

Not like he was high or drunk, I got a sensitive smell so I could have smelled it if he was. Eventually, I was like 'aight' and called over my manager. She showed up, and he gave her the same spiel about wanting a gun. She had to explain to him like... twice, that we do not sell real firearms. After that, he finally got the idea, and left the store. My manager gave me this wide eyed look at me as if saying 'Was he for real?'

For a while, I worked at a Canadian Wholesale with my best friend (rare, yes). It was probably my favorite job ever and if the pay was higher, I most likely would have never left. It was a downer time when I left, but my friend always tells me whats up at work, since I miss the people and want the store to succeed. 

One day, I'm hanging out with my bud, and he tells me about this crazy customer he got one evening shift. Now at this Canadian wholesale, there aren't many employees and at the late evening, the store becomes pretty dead. The only sound are carts that the workers use, and the radio that plays the same 6 songs over and over (God, I hate that radio).

My friend was working in the bathroom supplies aisle when he noticed an old woman pushing a cart. He described her as hunched over and wearing a yellow bonnet. She approached him and asked if he knew where the bath salts were, which were right next to her. Haha, common mistake.

She decided to pat his shoulder and say 'thanks sonny', which made my bud nearly laugh.

As she was on her way out, after picking up some salts, another woman was walking down the aisle, a younger one. She tried to get by the old lady, but there, for some reason, is a pillar in the aisle, which takes up a third of the width. She accidently bumped the corner where the handle was and my friend claims this old woman, hunches over a bit more and HISSES AT THE LADY.

I assumed he meant like a hissy comment, but he said she out right hissed like a rabid animal. The young woman didn't even have time to apologize before this crazy hag made her way out. My friend and the woman had a little laugh.

Later though, the same old woman is searching for something in the aisle 2 away. My friend asked if she needed help and she asks for a supervisor. My friend called over the Supervisor, a pretty nerdy guy in his late 20's. He goes to help her and he does, finding a product. She then looks at him and asks him if he is married yet. He tells her, with a laugh, he isn't even dating someone.

This woman decides to go full Grandma and starts saying things like ""You must! Find a nice girl! Have children! Make your mother proud and make her some grand children!""

t3_cwscxa,Please use paper bags whenever possible.,"Today, we ran out of paper bags. This is largely in part of one of my coworkers, who is always trying to do her part for the environment. Every customer she rings up: “Would you like paper or plastic?” If they don’t care, she goes with paper. I completely support this, even though it’s kind of a pain to bag for her. She is very passionate about minimizing waste and recycling.

Except, today our manager came in to tell her she isn’t allowed to offer a choice anymore. Only bust out paper if she is specifically asked to. According to our sympathetic manager, corporate has asked that we don’t use paper bags without being asked to specifically, since they are more expensive. If we want to be more environmental, we can suggest they buy a reusable bag.

Here’s the kicker: this coworker informed me that many people have said they would have used paper bags if they knew we had them. They are hidden from the public eye. Literally, they are kept in a hard-to-see place under the checkstands, you can’t see them.

So I am telling everybody: since we aren’t allowed to ask for your preference, this is a general statement: We have paper bags. A lot of grocery stores do, even if it isn’t obvious. Please ask for your groceries in paper if you can. If not for the environment, then do it to stick it to the greedy corporate jerks. Tell your friends! I’m going to ask for paper whenever I shop now, just because we aren’t allowed to tell people that we have them while they’re checking out.

t3_cwkdsq,"No, you can't park in the fire lane","This happened a few months ago when we still had our former store manager (FSM).  We have issues with customers parking just wherever.  3 of our parking rows have disabled parking at the end closest to the store.  Anything past those spaces are the driving lanes.  People will park 4 deep and only leave enough room for one car to squeeze past.  They also park in the fire lane which blocks access to propane, ice, the outdoor garden area, etc.

Our FSM would not let us confront customers and ask them to move or inform them they're in a no parking zone.  Instead he would have us call the nonemergency police number and have them ticketed and towed.  

I was exiting the garden area after a break.  Lady stopped me.  

HER: Can I park here while I run inside to pay for these flowers and grab a few other things?

ME: Ma'am I can't tell you you can't park here but I can tell you if you do, someone from customer service will be calling the police and you will be ticketed and towed.  

HER: What?   Can I or not?

ME:  Again, I cannot tell you that you can or can't park here but I can tell you if you do, the police will come, you will be given a ticket of around $125, towed for about $90, and each day your car is in the impound lot is $85.

HER:  Quit talking in riddles and just answer me.

ME: I cannot tell you where you can and cannot park.  I can only tell you that if you park there you will be ticketed and towed.

HER: Is it so g**damned hard to answer a question???  Can. I. Park. Here?

ME:  Ma'am please listen to me carefully.  I cannot, as in I'm not allowed to, tell you that you cannot park here.  What I can tell you is if you park anywhere that is not a clearly marked parking space, as designated by the white lines, and park here, in the fire lane which is marked yellow and has no parking signs every 4 ft, store policy is to call the police.  If your car is parked in a clearly marked no parking zone, you will get a ticket that is usually around $125.  The police will then call for a tow.  They will charge you $90 for the tow.  Then on top of that, you cannot retrieve your car until the ticket and the tow fee are paid.  They will charge you $85 each day your car is impounded.  Now, if it is worth $300 minimum to park in a clearly marked no parking zone, by all means, stay.  I'm not allowed to tell you not to park there.  

HER: heads in to shop.

ME: straight to the service desk to call it in.  

She came out to find her car being pulled onto the tow truck.  Of course after screaming at the police, she came in to yell at me that my answer was too vague.  FSM took over at this point.

FSM: Ma'am, were there signs that said no parking?  Then that's all that's needed.  I don't allow my employees to risk injury by being ran over by someone mad when they are told they can't park somewhere.  Now have a pleasant day.

Yes, she called corporate.  NSM policy is to nicely inform them they cannot park here, then call the police if they refuse to move..  2 people have already just avoided being hit.  I think I like old policy better.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cwq3xa,"""We Only Come For The Free Nights, SO Have Fun Losing Our Business""","So at my local firearms store we also have our own firing range and we tend to have a lot of cool deals for customers. Honestly, it's amazing that we still keep it running because our deals are pretty generous but the main store kind of keeps it afloat. One of those deals is that on Wednesdays, ladies, veterans, and local law enforcement get to shoot for ""free"". I put quotations because it used to be free until (surprise, surprise) the store found that it wasn't making much money from that; so it got revised to if you fit that category and had a purchase of $10 or more in the range, you're shooting lane would be free. That's still not bad considering that a box of ammo is usually $10-$15 at its cheapest anyway. If a woman or officer happened to bring a friend with them, the friend is to pay the full price of $15 as opposed to a guest usually paying $5 if the main shooter payed his or her full $15 for the lane.

Well, some of the guys who worked at the range part of the store had a hard time getting the memo of the transition, so there were a few issues of certain people still shooting for free without paying the minimum balance (management isn't really great in the range but I'll spare that rant). So naturally my department of the store's customer service has to deal with whatever issues come from there. Well about three months after we made this change I had this couple come up to my service desk Wednesday night.

Me: Hi sir! Is there anything I can help you with?

Male: Yes, you see me and my girlfriend come here to this store all the time. We tend to shoot on Wednesdays for date night and we usually love it here. But You're guys at the range informed me that we have to spend $10 here to get our free lane.

Me: Yes sir, it's a change we made quite a while ago. The family who runs this place decided that they still need at least some purchase to be made to keep the range running on Wednesdays since it's so popular.

Male: Well this is unacceptable! We've always shot here for free. My fiance and I have always given you business and this is how customers are treated? There has to be some mistake! My fiance didn't have to pay on her last visit, and I only had to pay $5.

Me: I'm sorry sir but that's not supposed to be our policy. We have some new guys there, and I think they were confused about how the pricing works. Since her lane was free, you're to pay the full price for your lane since you are technically the first ""paying"" shooter. I apologize for the misinformation, however the gentlemen in the range today are enforcing the proper policy.

Fiance: I can't believe this. You guys are so dishonest!

Me: ?????

Male:Well you know what? You guys just lost our business! We've supported your range for this long but if that's how things are, we'll just go elsewhere!

Me: Alrighty then sir! I hope you have a great night!

I was cashiering with a partner who was packing up people's orders and it was pretty busy, so I was in the zone focusing on my work. I heard what sounded like someone clearing their throat loudly and grossly, but you hear some surprising noises from people, so I'm not super phased. 

My partner turned to me and said ""did you just see that""

""No, but I heard it""

""That guy just SPIT on the floor""

""Wait, what?""

Apparently dude just hocked a loogie and spit it on the floor of our totally INDOOR PLACE OF BUSINESS.

My partner has kind of a dudebro vibe, so he turns to the guy and says ""dude, did you just spit on the floor?""

""Yeah.""

""That's kind of nasty, don't you think?""

""Well someone has to clean it up anyway.""

I haven't stopped cringing all day. The area where he spit is notorious for where bored kids play while their parents check out, and I visibly gagged when it happened.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cw6sy5,“I thought about screaming help”,"So this happened yesterday right before closing time. I work at a hardware store, and had just came in from my lunch. I walked over towards the paint area and hear this lady screaming like someone was dying. 

C: EXCUSE ME DOES ANYONE WORK IN THE PAINT AREA?!

She’s just screaming that....to no one just standing in the middle of the store. So I walk up and help her.

Me: excuse ma’am do you need help? 

C: of course I do! I need x amount of paint.

Me: alright give me about ten minutes for all this. 

She orders quite a bit of paint and some where in the mix I fucked up and gave her a gallon instead of a quart. My boss tells me to just discount it and let her take the whole thing. That’s fine with me she’s gets out of here quicker and I don’t have to be yelled at. 

She comes back and she’s actually really nice and polite when I explain what happened. So I follow her up to the register and she actually starts telling the cashier what happened and saying it was her fault I messed up. 

While I’m standing there waiting for her to finish checking out another gentleman ( other guy)comes up.

OG: excuse me sir I have a question to ask you. I thought about just screaming help in the middle of the store but I’m not an idiot. 

Then he just dead stares at the First Lady. It took all I had to not bust out laughing. I answered his question and the First Lady tucked tail and scurried out without saying anything else.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cwamns,"""I ran out of gas so can I have a refund?""","This is my first post ever on Reddit and I'm on mobile so forgive me for any errors. Just thought I'd share this crazy phone call I had today. So I work at gas station right outside of a grocery store in Mississippi. I work inside a small box with bullet proof glass to prevent robberies. I'm doing my usual routine, filling the cigarettes and waiting on customers when the work phone rings. I pick it up and a man answers. I'll be Me and the guy on the phone will be Idiot.

Idiot: ""I bought gas here earlier today and drove to Tennessee and now I'm out of gas. I want a refund.""

Me: ""Well we don't give refunds on gas and you drove pretty far. You've probably just used it all.""

Idiot: ""There must of been something wrong with the gas. I'm on the side of the road and my car is empty. What are you gonna do about it?""

Me: ""There's nothing I can do. If you want to argue then you can call the main store and see if they'll tell you something different.""

Idiot: ""No I want to talk to you and work something out."" 

This is when a very impatient customer showed up and did not want to wait for me to finish my phone call and proceeded to bang on the glass and yell that she wanted gas. I told the man to wait just a second for me to start the pump for this lady. When I picked up the phone again I noticed he had hung up.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cwcj7e,"Couple travel far to store after misreading website, blames company when they realise","Hi guys! Thought I'd tell you about the most memorable customers I've had in the last couple years I've worked in retail. First, I need to give some context - it'll be important later.

So I work in a urban sports store (skateboards, stunt scooters, etc) in a small town, so naturally our stock isn't anything compared to the other store in the franchise, which has a massive warehouse with all our stuff. Most sales come from the website the bigger store operates, so patrons come in thinking we have that particular item when we don't. We offer to order it in from the warehouse and have it delivered to us in a few days but as you'd expect, people aren't aware of this and are often pretty disappointed. To try and combat this, we asked head office to put a notice on our's store page on the website, to call ahead to check, and order it in if needed. Simple? Of course not.

So it was around 5pm yesterday afternoon a couple walked in, and I had that gut feeling that they were gonna be pain in the ass. They walked around the small storefront (and I mean small, some living rooms are bigger than our store) mumbling to each other in confusion, until they walked over to the counter. Let's call him Richard (R) and myself (M):
    
&gt; M: Hi there! How can I help?

&gt; R: Hi, we came in to buy a pair of ice skates for my kid?

&gt; M: Oh sorry, we don't stock ice skates in this store unfortunately. However, we do have many on our website that you can have ordered to your house on one-day delivery. If you're local, we can order them in to get here in the next couple days.

&gt; R: Excuse me?! We've driven two hours, from [place that's quite far away] to get these skates because your store lied to us! This is not acceptable.
    
We've had customers visit wanting ice skates before, specifically figure skating ones, however they were all local &amp; few and far between. The nearest ice rink is miles away, and due to the low interest we don't stock them. However, I found it very fishy that they said they were lied to, so I probed further.

&gt; M: Oh wow, I'm really sorry to hear that! Who told you that we had them?

&gt; R: Your website! It says on the page on your store! I'm going to post all about this on social media! This is awful from [brand].

Awesome! A place to dig - maybe head office made messed up and said we stocked them. I head to the page and read the bio - nothing on ice skates. Even said to call us to check. Cool, they either misread or are lying to cover their back. But, they were already irate and I hadn't lost enough of the will to live to call them out on it. I eventually calmed them down (like, the littlest bit) and told them I'll talk to my manager later about this (I was the only one in at the time), and told them where the nearest skates could be bought; to be fair they were an hour away and would be closed by then. When they realised they weren't gonna get anything, they had a mini-storm out the store. After I had a small five minute ""what the fuck just happened"" break, I dm'd my manager what happened and I forgot about it.

Earlier today, I came into work to support a stock delivery (no ice skates, unfortunately) and filled in my colleague (C) on what happened. After finishing, and waiting for a customer to come in - it was a Tuesday early afternoon after all  - I notice a notification coming from the store slack account. I clicked to see what it was and the mad lad Richard left a comment on a post on the company's social media account. I won't put what he said, since it's quite identifiable but to paraphrase, it wasn't exactly PG-13.

The pair of us had a good laugh, especially at the comments on the slack message (e.g ""why did he not just call ahead"" etc, etc). What I didn't notice was C saw the guys handle and looked through his profile. Dear god, I have never seen another human bitch and moan like this one did. I think at one point he complained the french fries at a supermarket cafeteria was burnt (they were crispy at best from the picture he posted). Oh yea, there was so much right-wing stuff it was insane. Later my manager got in contact with head office, and confirmed my end of the story.

Afterwards, we found out later on google maps that there were two figure skate stores in the city he came from. Intelligence 100.

I've had a few interesting customers in the last few years in retail, but holy hell was a heck of a saga. Hope you guys had a laugh as well.

tl;dr - couple drove hours to store because they misread website, have a mini-meltdown, rants to social media page, laughed at.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cw26sh,I actually have a positive post!,"While ringing up a customer yesterday (I work at a grocery/department store) she told me she loves coming through my line because I'm always so efficient, helpful, etc.  So I thanked her and told her that was really nice to hear. Then towards the end of my shift, the owner of a local sports bar and grill came through my line and said, ""Hey, there's my favorite cashier!""  I've rung him up many times over the years, but this is the first time he verbally told me that he likes it when I'm the one who rings him up. Gotta say, those two compliments probably helped me get through my day.  I really do try to make it a point to get to know my regulars while still being friendly to those I haven't developed such rapports with yet. Therefore, it's always nice when someone sees the effort you put in to provide great service, and on top it that, tells you to your face how much they appreciate you.  Comments/compliments like this helps sustain me after dealing with rude people, idiots, etc.  Am definitely thankful for my friendly customers and regulars!",TalesFromRetail
t3_cwdp29,Grandmother aura,"Hi, buckle up for a (n eventually) wholesome story. Also, sorry for bad English, mistakes pointing welcome.

Had one customer, lady in her 50's. I admit I was kind of cranky because I slept badly lastnight, but she just compounded on the problem with kind of a nasty attitude (or maybe thats what it felt to me). On top of that, another lady 30 min before that was ""super busy and in a hurry"", that just left her things in the counter and took off, because we had the *audacity* of not taking care of her, ahead of people who arrived before.

Well, then comes a third lady, around 20 min after the second one. You couldnt picture a more grandma-like person. She immediatly put me in a good mood with her grandmother aura skill, max level. She was asking for a product (a type of candy, going to assume for her grandchildren), but after a couple of minutes of describing and searching, she was getting the names mixed and it was another type of candy. We just laughed, and Im still kinda, hours later.

I haven't had a birthday cake in maybe 10 years and I was so overwhelmed that I forgot to blow out the candles and holy crap it was the sweetest thing ever lmao. Usually we only have cakes when someone get promoted or is leaving the store but my coworkers went out of their way to celebrate my birthday 😭

I've been in retail for 5 years now and have never had such a healthy working environment, these people are actually like my family and every Karen and screaming kid that pees on the floor/ in the change room is totally worth it because I get to be with these people every day.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cw3e0k,How do you know if something is or is not a book?,"The other day I had to really hold back my laughter when I overheard my coworker dealing with a nuisance customer. Last week there was a coupon in some newspapers that gave customers £5 off their transaction if they were spending £20 or over on books, stationary or greetings cards. The print on the coupon very clearly stated what it could NOT be used on.

So in the afternoon I noticed a paper-craft magazine left behind the till, and my coworker tells me someone has rang up asking for it. About an hour later this person came in to buy it. I was putting stock out near the till, and this is what I heard:

Customer: ""Excuse me, I called earlier about a magazine? A craft magazine.""

Coworker: ""Oh yes, is this the one you asked for?""

Customer: ""...is that the newest issue? It looks like the last issue.""

Coworker: ""Let me just check on my scanner...yeah this issue came out two weeks ago but the next one isn't out until next week according to this.""

Customer: ""Oh right...well I'll get it in case I haven't got it already. I have a coupon...""

As she produced the coupon my coworker immediately noticed it was the £5 off £20 one, and told the customer it won't work on such a small transaction.

Coworker: ""Oh that coupon will only work if you're spending £20 or more, this magazine is only £9.99.""

Customer: ""It says £5 off.""

Coworker: ""Yeah £5 off any transaction over £20 of books, stationary or greetings cards. If you have a look around maybe there's something else you might like that will bring it up?""

Customer: ""What about a few of those books? Two or three of them is probably about £10 right?""

Coworker: ""These are all new books, this is the paperback chart. They range from £7.99 to £9.99.""

Customer: ""What! £7.99 for a book? That's a bit much, especially for paperbacks!""

I'm stood there thinking hold on, your magazine is more than that for less content...She decided to have a quick look around the shop for something else, but didn't get very far before my coworker suddenly realised! Magazines are excluded from the coupon! Whoops, better quickly tell the customer.

Coworker: ""Excuse me! Sorry, I've just double checked the coupon fine print, magazines aren't actually included in the offer. It's ONLY books, stationary and greetings card.""

Customer: ""Well this is a book.""

Coworker: ""It's a magazine.""

Customer: ""Magazines are books though.""

Coworker: ""I know what you mean but they are classed as different types of products.""

Customer: ""Well that doesn't mean its not a book.""

Coworker: ""But its a magazine. Its not classed as a book.""

Customer: ""Well if its not a book what would YOU call it???""

Coworker: ""...a magazine.""

Customer: ""Oh whatever I just want this stupid thing forget the coupon.""

So she bought her magaz-sorry, she bought her book and left. Hopefully she'll be back next week to buy some fountain pens with our 3 for 2 deal on pencils.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cw7b1x,Hope you like the wine...,"This happened the other day. I work in a wine shop, and this softly spoken, well dressed, middle-aged man came in. He approached my young, female colleague (relevant info because I think he thought he was being edgy to impress her or something) and asked her to recommend a wine. 

She picked one out, described it and led him to the till. So far so normal. He pays, then blurts out, in the same soft spoken voice: “I better like this wine or I’ll come back and cut your throat.” 

We just stood there in shock for a second before she nervously responded: “I really hope you like it, so...”

Now, I have a dark sense of humour, but this guy was a new customer - he’d never even met my colleague, so he certainly didn’t have the kind of rapport you’d need to say something like that. 

I just hope he was actually joking.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cw3qiv,How Dare You,"So this happened a quite a few years ago. I was working at the Till on my own, quickly serving my customers while being polite and courteous to them. Then this older gentleman comes up to the till. I scan his purchases, ask would he like a bag letting him know we charge 1p per bag. He just nods his head, I bag up his magazines, and then the fun begins.

“So that’s a total of £X.XX” I said clearly

“What?” He replied looking confused. I quickly realise he might be hard of hearing, so I repeat myself but louder

“£X.XX!”

“What?” Again I have to repeat myself, but louder and slower.

“Its £X.XX!!” At this point my manager sticks her head around a corner, wondering what’s going on, sees me and the old man. She quickly puts two and two together, and seeing I have it handled goes back to doing her own work.

“Oh just take it from that” he replied throwing a random amount of money in the counter, I quickly count up the required amount and put into the till. He then collects the rest of his money and his change and then walks off, back into the store. I am thinking ‘oh he wants something else’. Oh how wrong I was, he goes down the aisle where my manager was, then storms out about 3 minutes later in a huff. My colleague comes over and she looks like she can barely keep herself from laughing her head off

“You won’t believe what that old man said to manager” me being curious asks to which I get the story

“Well he came over and asked manager, if she was the manager. Then when she confirmed it, said How Dare You have someone with learning difficulties on the till! I couldn’t understand a word he was saying! Manager flipped. One, he doesn’t have learning difficulties, we heard him clearly from over here, YOU have hearing difficulties, either get a hearing aid, or turn it bloody on. Secondly it doesn’t matter if someone has learning difficulties, as long as they can serve customers, and can do the job, that’s good enough for us, now get out of my store” both of us started laughing at this, me in shock, my colleague because of the wtf of it all.

Never saw that gentlemen again, probably didn’t like being told that he had hearing problems. Tell me what you think, and if you would like more stories, I have more ridiculous customer stories to share if anyone is interested.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cvvver,Let me ruin your rating because you were busy,"A couple of days a go I assisted a woman with updating her plans. Gave her an hour of my time for something that made our store very little. At the end I asked if she could please complete the survey she receives in her email and that a 10 means I've done my job right. 

These surveys are grossly scaled. Anything below a 9 is a detractor and lowers your commissions at the end of the month. These surveys also refer to their ”{company name} experience"" so people often rate the company not realising they're rating us. But this lady I specifically told it reflected on me. 

Yesterday she came back into the shop regarding an issue and my manager assisted her. I was with another customer but came to the front to grab them a charger. When there she said hi and I said hi and nodded back then left. 

This morning my manager opens their emails and boom she gave me a zero commenting ""All they care about is getting your money. No after sales service!""

This was my 12th survey of this month but because of scaling it caused me to drop 20/100 points. This potentially loses me hundreds of dollars in commision. So thank you cranky crone. Thank you for taking your frustration out on me and my minimum wage service.

Update:
Called her back to ask about how her connection went, she was really mad as its not working. Brought her back in-store and talked her through every step of getting her setup going. She was delighted but very pissed still about the previous day. She was mad at my manager for telling her to call up about the issue and mad at the person she got when she called up. Both gave her vague and unhelpful answers. 

When I asked if she had received a survey she stated yes and that she had said the initial transaction was fine but after sales was dreadful, mean in my manager. I assured her that regardless of intent, only the score reflects and it will solely be against me. 

She was very apologetic and has promised to try and remove it. I doubt she can but it does make me feel better knowing I was wrong thinking she did it against me out of spite.",TalesFromRetail

t3_cvv16e,Threatened by the toughest guy.,"This is a long one. I work the overnight cashier shift at a grocery store. I have come to hate it with a passion. It's much quieter but if something does go wrong I have pretty much nothing in the way of backup, and due to recent issues overnights are running on a complete skeleton crew.

This night was pretty normal, and so was this particular customer. At first. He got beer and when asked for ID pulled out his wallet without a fuss, which is always nice. He was having a lot of trouble, so I told him he didn't need to take it out as long as I could read the dates. I leaned forward slightly and then everything went wrong.

He glared at me and said, ""Do not look in my wallet."" I apologized and explained that that hadn't been my intention. Not good enough. He repeats that I am not to look in his wallet and I am not his wife (???). I apologized again. He finally got his ID out and showed it to me, reading his birth date in an incredibly angry voice. He honestly didn't seem drunk, just horrible, so I put it in without a word and hoped he would just leave.

He would. not. let. it. go. Kept saying I was not his wife (thank god!!) and that I had disrespected him. I was completely silent at this point. He was working himself into such a rage over my ""disrespect"" that I was actually starting to become afraid. Dude was over twice my size. A woman walked by and gave me a concerned look.

Finally he said, ""You do that again and you're going to get hurt.""

Aaaaand then I'd had enough. I whipped my head up and told him in a loud voice that he was not going to threaten me. Then I paged the crew chief while he screamed about how he didn't give a f\*\*\* who I called etc etc. Crew chief came before anything happened and tried to calm him down to no avail, but got him to agree to talk somewhere more private.

But not before the guy turned to me with a look of  utter hatred, said, ""Keep this, you trashy b\*\*\*\*"", and threw his receipt at my face.

So while I stood there using all of my willpower to stay put and remain calm, the woman from before came up. Turns out she'd called the cops and she wanted to check up on me and tell me they might stop by. I thanked her because I REALLY needed a reminder of the existence of basic human kindness. Seriously, thank you lady.

Crew chief came back and dismissed the guy as a drunk (let him have the beer though). He also let me know that the customer had said ""something even worse"" about me. I asked if it was the c-word and he said no and refused to tell me anything beyond that. He'd told the guy to have a good night and sent him on his way.

Yep. I very nearly walked out of there forever.  Too bad I need the money.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cvsxsq,Customer won't let me take stock from the shop floor pt 3,"Hey guys, I know I said i'd give you an update about what happened to karen after my last encounter with her, but ive had no news and she's been allowed to shop in the center again, hence why this event is even taking place.

OK, so this happened last week, when I was supposed to be off for the week. I got a call on the Monday from my manager asking if I could cover for her on the Tuesday, as she was having problem walking due to an injury in her knee. I reluctantly agreed, as it was my dads birthday and had made plans. I went in the following morning and did absolutely nothing other than turn the till on until it was time to open. 

As soon as the clock hit 9 I opened the store and began looking at the jobs that were left for me to get done. The main job was again to get recall off the shop floor. I went through the recall list to see what shoes needed to be removed from the shop floor and started to take off some dolly shoes that were placed near the door. 

As I was taking off the shoes I hear some one say

""You're doing it again!""

I turn slightly and notice Karen outside the shop, glaring at me. 

me:""Excuse me?""

Karen: You're removing shoes!

Me:Yes their going back to the warehouse, so they can be sent to another store. We're not selling enough of them.

Karen: Well you won't sell them if you keep removing them. Put them back.

We hadn't sold a pair of these shoes in nearly a month hence why they were going back.

Me: I'm sorry this is part of my job, if you have a complaint, feel free to call customer services.

At this point I got an order from a customer on the till, placed the shoes in a tub and went to collect the customers order from the shop floor. I turn to go back to till to make sure I have everything for the order and see karen taking the shoes from the bucket. I mean all of them.

Me: Excuse me! can you please put those back in the tub

Karen: No I am putting them back, which should be your job. 

She sees the shoes and bag in my arms.

Karen: You're doing it again! How dare you remove more stuff!

Me: Someone has already payed for these, I'm making sure they don't get accidently sold.

Karen: I don't believe you, you don't have any proof.

Me: I do have proof, but it contains customer details, so I am unable to show it to you, as it is against the law and company policy

Karen: You're lying! Put those back right now!

I was getting fed up, I was in a bad mood already due to being in work when I was meant to be off again, but she was pushing me to my limit.

Me: No they belong to a customer and please can you put those shoes back in the bucket.

Karen: No, they belong where they were. Now put those items back or are you deaf as well as stupid

I ignored her accepted the order and put the items in a bag and stapled the receipt to bag. At this point I was torn whether to put the order in the back, or wait Karen out. Turns out I didn't have to do either. Karen dropped the shoes she was holding and tried to come behind the till.

Me: Excuse me, you can't come back here.

Karen: I'm just stopping you from removing stuff from the shop

She reaches for the customers bag, but I step between her and the bag.

Karen: Get out of my way! You can't even do you're job probably, that stuff belongs on the shelves!

Me: No it doesn't, it's been paid for already. 

Karen: You're lying!

She tries to push me aside, but there is not a lot of room so she fails miserably.

Luckily a centre cleaner was walking past, saw the commotion and went to get the centre manager, who we'll call G.

G came into the store and asked what was going on.

Karen: She's removing stuff from the displays!

G: She's well within her right to do that, if that's what she needs to do.

Karen: She's even lying about it. She's saying customers have bought things and is trying to removing them

I point to the bag on the floor, with the recipt clearly stapled to it.

G, asked Karen to go with him to his office.

I had to phone, my manager, area manager and notify customer services in case she phoned to complain. Which took all morning. Unfortunately the Police weren't called to this situation and she isn't banned from the center, but she is banned from the store. I hope it's over.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cvxh8t,Don't You Love Pests?,"I started my job today. While I was following the store manager on a tour of the store, HE STEPPED ON A FREAKIN BAT! Not a baseball bat, but a nocturnal flying bat! Normally that would have deterred me from working there, but considering I'm only working part time, I'm fine with having watched my manager squish a bat with his shoe.

Basically, what happened was he was showing me the back of the store, just to familiarize me with it in case I need to go there. He said ""I doubt you'll ever really need to head back here often or at all since you'll be working out at the front end, but-""

crunch

He stopped his stride and looked down at his shoe. A poor little bat just got smooshed. I swear I felt bad for the bat, despite it being a pest in a retail store. Not a pleasant way to go. He looked at me, saw my rather straight face at what I just saw and said ""Well, you see something new every day.""

""No kidding... that the first time that's ever happened?""

""Yeah. Never had a bat sneak in here before. Birds, sure. But not bats.""

I shrugged and recalled something I had said earlier to him when he was telling me I might not head to the back often. I had said that you never know what will happen or if you need to head to the back.

""Always expect the unexpected."" He smiled at that and laughed at the blunt remark.

I mean... it was pretty apt given I wasn't expecting a BAT in the store or for it to just sit there and get stepped on. Plus side is he's put me on shift in a couple of days saying I'll fit right in with my outgoing attitude and responses.",TalesFromRetail

They looked at me weird and asked how I decide to round the prices. Sensing an argument, I apologised and said that 2c are out of circulation and gave them a 5c coin, which they took and exited the shop with a curt laugh.

t3_cvrz2u,No control over inventory,"I sell cbd.

  Our inventory is what it is. If it isn't on the shelf, i don't have it right now. We are a super small business, working on building up. With a secondary location, in a city about ten minutes away by car. 

  Boss and i are doing the best we can. But some weeks are much busier than others.  So normal shipments either go super fast or super slow.  The past two weeks, it's been super fast. And while she has been overnighting product to the store, shipments are smaller and more concentrated on specific product. Until we get things situated.

  So that brings me to today.

  Gentleman comes in and asks for a specific milligram and all i have is the higher dose.  He cant afford the higher dose so he gets cranky.

  ""I guess im gonna have to shop around. I thought i was doing good coming in here and finding this last month. I just dont wanna have to go up in dose and then next month when i need more try to come back down.""

  All valid points. But he wasnt letting me get a word in edgewise about how he could just get the higher dosage and break the dose down in half. 

  So he leaves.

  And then sits in his car. He found a coupon online and comes back in. Asks if ill honor it. I said sure. Like, if he had given me a chance the first time, i wouldve slapped on a military discount and called it a day. And the coupon he found was only slightly better than the military discount(by a dollar, i just checked). 

  But why do people just steamroll you? Like bro, let me talk. I get it. Youre old. And anxious.  But i have zero control over the inventory.  I have zero control over the prices.  But if youd give me ahcnace to say anything, ill always make it more affordable. If youre nice.

t3_cvd3da,”It’s a paper bag GET OVER IT!”,"So I work in a supermarket in Ireland that has self service tills. The other day I was on self service for the night and these two women came up to the self scan beside me. They were buying a couple of cakes and other bits of food. 

So bear in mind, my work sells clothes too and we are not allowed to give the paper clothes bags to customers that aren’t buying clothes, because we ran out of them completely a couple of months ago for a couple of weeks and our managers had a meeting and were informed not to hand them out unless it’s for clothing.

**note: we sell 70c reusable plastic bags that customers usually purchase if they need one**

Anyways one of the women asks me if there’s any boxes so they can carry their stuff. I tell her if there is they’ll be down at the end of checkouts. So she goes and walks down the whole way to check the ends of the checkouts for boxes and spots at the very end checkout the paper bags. She goes in behind the till and grabs a paper bag. And that’s when I go up to her.

Me: Sorry I’m afraid the paper bags are only for clothing.

Customer: (Looking shocked) So we can’t take this paper bag for our stuff?

Me: You weren’t buying any clothing so... no.

Customer: (Looking even more annoyed)
Are you serious?

Me: Yep.

Customer: (Giving me the paper bag back and answering back really viciously) It’s a paper bag GET OVER IT! 

Customer storms off and eventually finds a box for her stuff. My manager saw this all happening and gave me a thumbs up and I was there with my blood boiling.

TLDR; Customer snaps at me for not letting her have a paper clothing bag for her purchases when she wasn’t buying any clothes and we’re not allowed to give them out",TalesFromRetail
t3_cvhha5,Lady implies she will pee on the floor if I don’t let her use the employee restroom.,"Okay, some background:

I work in a pop-up shop. We buy out unused space for our seasonal store. Our current location used to have a customer bathroom. It’s been empty for about a year. The plumbing is bad, and the entire men’s bathroom is unusable. The women’s has a single stall that’s usable, and one functioning sink. In one phrase: not for customers. 

Today, an associate brought a distraught woman to me. The lady asked for a manager. The following ensues. 

Me: “Hi, I’m the manager, what’s up?”

Lady: “This worker says you don’t have a bathroom.”

Me: “Unfortunately, we don’t. There is one nearby in [mall location].”

Lady: “Yeah, ya see, I know that. They’re cleaning it. They say it’s for *my convenience* but I need it now.”

(At this point I assume it’s over)

Me: “Yeah, I had something similar happen. Sorry about that; I guess it just has to be cleaned some days.”

(Here, she puts an empty water bottle on our counter and looks visibly irritated.) 

Lady: “Look, I just finished this whole thing, and I need a bathroom now. I know [old store] had one.”

Me: “I’m sorry, company policy says I can’t let you into the back. It’s not customer accessible.”

Lady: “So if you won’t let me, what would happen if I walked through there and you didn’t tell me to do it?”

Me: “Umm, I think you would personally get in trouble. We aren’t allowed to let anyone in the back.”

Lady: “Well, if I don’t get to use your bathroom, you’re gonna have a mess to clean up.”

Me: “I’m sorry, there’s really nothing I can do.” 

From here my coworker (another manager) comes up. The woman goes through the whole ordeal again, saying we would have to clean her mess, and we called the nearby mall’s security to see if they would open the bathroom. Of course, they said no. Someone was cleaning the whole thing, and they needed it closed. This was about 30 mins before that mall closed today (Sunday is early), so I figured it would end up like this. 

At the end of it all, my coworker went against policy and escorted her to the restroom. I was a little upset he did it, because others could use her as a precedent (“you let HER, now ME”). I just can’t understand why she wouldn’t leave and use the bathroom anywhere else. We aren’t in the middle of nowhere.

t3_cvdjpa,Customer gets mad because I don't want to handle her spit-covered item,"I work in a second hand tech shop. We buy in hardware and software from customers for cash.

Woman came in with a load of PS3 games, all in pretty poor condition (scratched and generally not very clean). I was working my way through them and I came to a copy of GTA5 that was really gross. It was covered in who knows what, all gunky and crusty. I got a cloth to clean the disc to no avail. Told her I couldn't trade that game in because it was too dirty and handed it back to her.

She took the disc, spat on her finger and rubbed some of the gunk off and tried to hand it back to me. She then got mad at me when I refused to trade it in because I didn't want to touch her phlegm covered disc! Man, I love retail.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cvdpck,“Oh that was -insert amount here-“,"Now I’m not sure about you but at the store I work at you cannot just enter a value and add that to someone’s total. This usually only happens when people are buying some clothes, they’ll have an item that doesn’t have its tag on it so I cannot scan it up. (I’m aware of the UPC inside clothing but that doesn’t work to type that in where I am). Generally the items of clothing will all be from the clearance section so they’ll say “Oh that was $1.00 like the others” and it’s like, Ok while I do not doubt that, I still would need the tag in order to enter it into the computer so that it will basically say “this item has been sold, we now need to order 1 more of this specific item to fill the stock” I explain this to them and they generally understand and will either go or go send a family member to go and retrieve another of the item. This however was not the case. 
A lady came up to my register, not your typical Karen. And she had a whole bunch of clothes to purchase. And first off she wouldn’t put them on the belt so that “they wouldn’t get dirty” so she handed me an armfull of clothes for me to scan. 
I eventually get to the item without the tag. 

Me: “I’m sorry ma’am this item doesn’t seem to have its ta-“

Lady: “Sign said it was three dollars” 

Me: “I understand ma’am however, I would still need the tag in order to scan it, so that the computer can then -“ 

Lady: “I’m telling you it was only three dollars, so just add three dollars to my total.” 

Me: “I apologize ma’am but I cannot do that. It’s not an option on the register and it wouldn’t account for tax, if you would like I can hold your items here while you go and get another one that has a tag”

Lady: “Whatever, just put it to the side, I don’t want it”

I set the item to the side and finish ringing up her items, she pays, I hand her the receipt and tell her “have a good one” where she doesn’t say anything in response and just heads to Customer Service and reports me. 

Also it would turn out the shirt she wanted, was not $3 but $16.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cvcxci,"Read the room, lady.","This morning, my boss called a staff meeting to go over store policy with us as a result of a negative facebook review. (We're almost positive that the reviewer was lying, as she said the staff didn't say a word to her even after she tried to engage in conversation. I manage this place, and I know for a fact that we all greet the customers to a certain extent. We don't just stare at them. We also have to ask followup questions like ""what size would you like?"" ""Do you want to add anything?"" ""Your total is X dollars and XX cents."") So while we're all sitting here, it's incredibly clear that we're closed. All of us are sitting listening to our boss, nobody is at the counter, lights are off, and we don't open for another hour. Our hours are listed directly to the left of the door.

This woman, who has never been to the store, comes up and places her order. We're all staring at her. We end up having to prep everything on the fly, and she still doesn't take the hint that we aren't open yet. She complains about a long wait and it takes everything in me not to say ""it's because we don't open until 10. It's 9."" I couldn't have a negative interraction in front of my boss and the staff I manage/train, but I mean, the lights are off, a manager is giving instruction, and nobody else is there other than some people huddled to one side. There are also bagels and orange juice, as there usually is for staff meetings. We had two other people come in asking if we were open, and we said ""not yet."" She really couldn't get the hint that the lot was empty apart from my car, the owner's car, and the night manager's car. Nobody else in the shopping center was open yet, either, except for the bagel shop around the corner and the laundromat. Everyone else delays their sunday morning openings, too. She also said she doesn't come to this branch often, usually the one about 25 minutes away from ours. The hours in that store are identical to ours. I know customers are dumb, but I'd rather deal with them when we're actually open for business, and not when I'm exhausted and still pissed i had to give up my only off day which was preset 17 weeks in advance. I refuse to count today as an off day because I still went in for that meeting and I did do work, so this is day 8, and tomorrow is my last off day before going back to school.

t3_cve3kc,BULLCRAP,"So I work in the back of my store, stocking and stuff like that. But a few weeks back I was forced to learn how to work a register as side help because our company's corporate insists on making the entire store work with a skeleton crew, so the front end needs help often. Today I was called up front at about 2 pm. A guy who I think was probably my third customer came through and everything was mostly okay until the end. At the beginning he commented on the lack of baggers, I agreed that it was ridiculous. 

Everything was good, while I was scanning his stuff there was an Xbox card mixed in which seemed strange because this guy was probably in his 60s, but it's not unheard of and maybe he was getting it for a grandkid or something. I set the gift card on top of the counter thing next to the credit card reader and continued. Due to the lack of baggers the man was bagging and mostly had everything done when it came time to pay. 

He paid with a card, so I hit the credit card payment button and as it was processing, I said : ""oh by the way sir, your gift card is right here"" *taps counter* 

His receipt printed off and I started to hand it to him at this time as well.

Man: ""what gift card?""

Me: ""this one here. It was with your stuff sir""

Man: ""WHAT? THAT'S NOT MINE. You didn't charge me for that did you?"" 

Note: it was for $25, and his total was about $100 so it did bump up his total a decent portion but it's not like it was a $500 card.

Me: ""well it was with your things so yes I scanned it""

Man: ""WELL TAKE IT OFF""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir but it's too late, I can't take it off"" (the receipt is in his hand now so very obviously the transaction is over)

Man: ""BULLCRAP""

Me: ""sir I'm very sorry, but it's too late for me to do anything now, you have to go over to the customer service desk and they'll take it off for you. I'm sorry""

Man: ""UNBELIEVABLE""

Me: ""I'm sorry but it was with your stuff so it looked like yours""

Man: *walks off grumbling*

Me after he left: ""man, what a d*ck"". Not the most professional comment to make but I was fuming inside about how someone could possibly get so upset about something so pointless, so it's probably lucky that's all I said.

I honestly have no idea how the card got there if he didn't put it there but fact is, it was right in the middle of everything he had, on top of the rest of his stuff. There was no reason to believe it wasn't his. This man was also wearing a ""US ARMY"" hat so I had to mentally congratulate him on doing a fine job of representing our military. A true American hero, yelling at 24 year olds for things out of their control. That's the patriotic thing to do.

Everyone after him was fairly nice, a woman farther back asked what his problem was, so at least everyone else was understanding. I had some very patient people luckily the rest of the way so the rest of my cashiering went more smoothly.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cv48qy,I yelled back at a customer," I'm an assistant manager at a dollar store. Our frozen food truck had come, and when they come they have to be received and processed immediately.  I'm still not fully trained, and the new store manager told me to handle it on my own despite never having processed a frozen food truck.  Luckily, the driver knew how to do everything and guided me through it, but it was time for one of the cashiers to go home.  She was supposed to leave at 1:30, but at this point it was already 1:50 and the store manager hadn't taken  her down, so I ran up to let her count her drawer down and go home.  

The other cashier was calling for a manager's assistance, but the sm wouldn't come up to help her.  Our store has a very strict policy that non-managers are not allowed in the office alone, and under no circumstances can money be left unattended.  I told her I would be as quick as I could, and the customer she was with said in a snarky voice that she would wait.  By the time we were done counting the money, the cashier's line was insanely long.    The customer she was with tells me I took too long and storms out.  Then the cashier tells me her register is starting to freeze up and was taking too long to print receipts. The frozen food was still out so I was trying to run back to let the other manager know that I couldn't do it right then and that I needed to help the cashier.  

On my way to talk to the manager the woman at the back of the line says, ""YOU need to open another lane right now!""  

I said back to her, ""Yes ma'am I know, but I need to speak to someone really quick I'll be right back."" She rolled her eyes at me.  

After I let the manager know what was happening, I ran back up and told everyone to move to another register since I was moving her.  

 An older gentleman gave me a nasty look and immediately screamed, ""WHY!?""  

""Sir, her register isn't working properly anymore and it's being slow.""  

""WELL THEN YOU NEED TO OPEN UP ANOTHER REGISTER!""  

I have never yelled at a customer before, but my stress levels were through the rough and he was unnecessarily aggressive towards me and wasn't the first person to tell at me that day.  So I yelled back, ""You're going to HAVE to wait because I need to move her to another register FIRST, and THEN I will open up another lane and check you out!""  

Everything was silent until I started moving her drawer after she finished checking out another customer.  Then the woman she had just checked out looked at the cashier and said, ""Thank you so much for being so courteous and patient!"" Then she looks at me and says, ""And YOU need to learn to respect people!""  

I didn't even respond and just opened up another register.  I was trying not to get upset, buy I could tell I was bright red and couldn't really hide the anger in my face.  Luckily, the man didn't come to my lane and everyone who came to mine was extra polite and one even started telling me she can't believe people are so rude to customer service people.  It felt good to finally have someone not antagonize me.  It also felt really good to yell even though I probably shouldn't have.  

TLDR; stressed at work, couldn't help my cashier immediately, her register stops working and I need to move her, irate customer yells at me, I yell back.

And just to add a little note, I don't smoke nor have I ever purchased cigarettes at this time. So this lady comes in asking for \*cigarette brand\* shorts. I've had several customers before her asking for cigarettes and they kindly point them out to me on what they want. I'm trying to figure out the kind of cigarette's she wants and kindly ask if she could point them out to me. She just stands there, giving me a ""you're an idiot"" look, and not answering. Thinking she didn't hear me but not wanting to ask again, I hold out the each \*cigarette brand\* type and ask her which one. She points out what she wanted, but not without a dramatic sigh and huffing, makes her purchase and leaves.

t3_cvb8nz,60 cent return,"Sorry this is my first post on both here and Reddit so sorry if I do it wrong.

So I've worked in a local dollar store for 3 years as a cashier that never got a raise (unless you count the time when the state raised minimum wage) and often on weekends because I was in college.  Sure enough summer comes around and I start working weekday mornings. It was a small town and often times older folk would come streaming in the morning. This particular morning my boss had a conference call, the truck had arrived the day before (which the stock room needed to be emptied ASAP), and we just received new labels for the shelf that needed be up ASAP. So as I'm frantically running around the store setting things up and working the cash register. So early in the morning, this older guy comes in and buys a drying dish rack, some candies, and the occasional miscellaneous items. No big deal.  As the busy day goes by and I'm nearing the end of my shift, the same older man comes in with his just recently purchased dish drying rack. Seeing him ahead of time, I know he's making a return. 

""Can I help you,"" I ask as he places the dish drying rack on the counter in front of me.

""Yes, I just checked my receipt and you over charged me for this,"" he says (not his exact words but something similar).

""Is it broken,"" I ask. This is the first time I experienced someone wanting a cash back for being overcharged.

He politely says no and just wants his money back that he was overcharged. Now at this point, I was the employee that had been working at this store the longest, knew my way around on how the store worked, and my manager trusted me. Not wanting to disturb my manager, for she was sitting in this claustrophobic room, and  conference calls are the worst, I try to solve the problem. After seeing the product in the computer, which said the product was $3.60, and checking the label on the shelf, which said the product was $3.00, I would honor the price on the shelf. (I still hadn't put out the new labels so maybe it was there). To no avail, I couldn't figure out how to give this guy his 60 cents back without making my drawer look like it was short on money or that the store has had a product stolen. Hating to disturb my manager, but needing to anyway, I explain to her the problem while she's half listening to the conference call. It must have been a stressful conference or the 60 cents return kinda sounded ridiculous as it did to me because she just reaches into her pocket and gives me 60 cents to give the older man. I give the man his 60 cents and he leaves as one happy customer. I never did find the new label for the dish drying rack and had to make a label with the actual price and item number.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cv3xtu,Lady tries to get lower price on runner by lying,"This actually happened last week but I am now just getting around to writing it. 

In the wonderful state of Michigan there are several anti-false advertising laws in place. Part of the law is that if the tag says $2.50 we have to sell it for $2.50 even if it meant $890 otherwise the customer can sue. The law however can be worked around because customers move things around constantly as all retail folk know all too well. So if it's one thing in the wrong spot that is in the guest not on us.

At my store we sell cut to length floor runners, those runners have two ways of knowing the price; a 7""X11"" sign that's attached to the strap that holds the sign and says the price, and a vintage to the left of the roll itself. 

A lady asked for my help so I went over to her, she immediately inquired to the price of a particular runner; one that had a sign attached to it, but I never look for those cause most of the time they're not even there. So I tell her the price on the bin tag. ""4.49 a  linear foot.""

""But this sign says it's 2.39 a foot."" She retorts.

I look at the sign and sure enough it says 2.39.. but it also says the name to a different runner down and to the left of the runner she wants. The sign was for a hard plastic runner that's used on hardwood floors so you do t cray how it as you walk across it, the runner she wanted looked like a commercial welcome may with a halfway Greek looking etched border.

""Well that sign is for this runner."" I pulled the sign off and put it on the right roll. ""It's for a hard surface runner as it says on the sign, the right price is 4.49, as it says on the bin tag here.""

""Well the sign says 2.39 so you *have* to give it to me for this price."" 

""Well since I'm here and have now told you that the price is 4.49, and shown you the bin tag no we don't.""

""But the sign said 2.39."" 

""And I said 4.49""

After a second of deliberation on her end she takes a 6 foot piece of runner and leaves. After my I told her firmly that it was 4.49 she thought about fighting more but decided not to.

After I handed her off the rolled up remnant and she was on her way I went to take care of the runner and lo and behold I find the right sign thrown onto the floor nearish where the roll was. 

My bet is she took the sign off, found a price she thought looked better and replaced it with that sign. 

I cut nearly 15 runners that day, not a one was that Greekish runner until that lady, and there wasn't any signs on the floor until after helping that lady.

'Those are £1 aren't they? They're in your £1 freezer but they don't have a label.' 

I explained that they are not in fact £1, but are only £1.50 and that we do not have an everything is a pound freezer. He insisted that we do have such a freezer (we don't) and in the end left the items behind because he's not paying £1.50 for them when everything else is £1 (it's not).

t3_cv022n,"""You're stupid and you don't know math""","So this actually happened yesterday and I'm still angry when I think back to it.

I've posted here before another story I think about how I work at a discount store chain in Germany that is initially from the US but now exists in Europe as well. I'm usually at the register most of the time, but that can vary from day to day.

Yesterday I was actually meant to be working on the floor area of the store (where clothes are hanging, etc) and I was to be at the third register if needed. Well at one point the line was getting long so I jumped in to help.

There comes the rude customer. He bought something, I don't even remember what anymore, worth 11. 97 euros. He handed me 15 euros and I proceed to give back the 3. 03 euros back. At this point he gave me 1.40 euros more and demanded I give him 5 euros back. That's all good, I don't mind doing that for people, many don't like having change in their wallet so I usually do it. However 3. 03 plus 1. 40 doesnt equal 5 euros. It equals 4. 43. I tell him that the 40 cents don't really help but I can give him back two 2 euro coins if he liked and make the four 10 cent coins in two 20 cent coins so he'd carry less change. Oh boy if only I knew.

He immediately started demanding his 5 euros and every time I tried to explain why I couldn't give it to him, that he hasn't given me enough change, he'd call me an idiot, how I don't pay attention, how I cannot count, how I don't know math, etc. He actually told me I'm an idiot that can't count. 

I tried again to explain why I couldn't and he said fuck it so I gave him the change back, and before he left he told me that he couldn't understand anything I said and that I should speak clearly next time. All the time super agitated and rude.

I looked at him like wtf? I'm a foreigner, I come from Greece and I live in Germany so I do have an accent, but my German is better than most foreigner's because I started learning it in Greece so I could come here and study. I actually write academically in German and I've never ever had an issue with anyone understanding me when I speak. Everyone does, I've never heard otherwise from people. And through the course of the argument, he never acted as if he wasn't understanding me. He was arguing back so of course he understood every single word I said. He just chose to throw a last minute insult before he fucked off.

For what it's worth, the next customer told me she could understand everything I said from further away. I felt a bit better even though I'm still pissed thinking about it. Why do people have to be so rude?! In the end, HE was the one who didn't know simple math!",TalesFromRetail

So off I went to work. Working in the vest was a bit of a pain as the plates on the front meant bending was made harder. But I was luckily assigned to doing some tidying. 

Then a code 100 got shouted. Basically this means that whoever’s at the front of store (duty managers or cashier) think there is a physical danger. This includes shoplifters. If you hear this, you drop everything including helping customers and go to assist. 

I heard the shout and being at the back of the big building, I ran to help. As I ran up the last section I spotted one of our notorious regular shoplifters (she apparently steals to order) shouting at the duty manager. Apparently she’d been acting suspiciously and when our duty manager tailed her she’d turned nasty, which is when the code got called. 

The moment she saw me belting along in all my gear, she screamed so loudly and went tearing out of the door at speed. I must have scared the living daylights out of her, enough that she dropped her bag. Funnily enough we found a cushion in it which she’d definitely not paid for. 

Weirdly I didn’t see her for weeks after (she would usually come in a couple of times a week, and we weren’t a store I’d say you’d shop in regularly as a habit).",TalesFromRetail

Almost always I lock the door behind me while I count the register, turn on displays, get settled, ect.

t3_cuvsbm,Many diferent languages in a shop,"This happened today, I work in a known video game shop in EU. I was talking to a friend about games and during this a person comes in and starts looking at games too. So I ask in lithuanian language if I could help him. And this man starts talking in russian assuming I know russian for sure, no doubts. I start talking in english because I never studied russian. He starts to ramble something about that I am just pretending to not know the language (I can understand about 10% of what is said to me in russian). I start talking in italian, he starts looking at me quite confused.. And he is still talking i russian, he absolutly was thinking I know russian and this happens every single time a russian comes in, they just assume everyone knows russian... My friend started talking in polish with him and this man talked in russian so we could kind of communicate with him, because polish and russian is atleast a little bit similar. Finally he bought a game and left.

t3_cuvs86,I walked in on my lead having a seizure,"I used to work at the local zoo a few years ago. I mainly worked at the food court which is where this story takes place. I recently went through health and safety training at my job, now that I'm no longer a contractor, when remembered this story. TL/DR at bottom, on mobile sorry for formatting and grammar.

Now I used with this girl named Beth (not real name). She was very nice and funny person to be around. She was part of our group that used to go out to eat after a weekend shifts. At some point she tells a story of having a seizure at a friend's birthday party. She told the story so calm it was a little off putting. She said she hadn't had a seizure in years after taking some medication and avoiding really salty food. I don't remember the name of the disease she said it was. The conversation changes and go back to eating. Still had a nice time

Some time passes and it's the middle of lunch rush. We run out of food trays at the counter so I go into the back kitchen to get more when I see her on the ground. Now I've never seen a person in real life seize up to this person but it definitely wasn't as dramatic as the TV made looks. It still freaked me out and no idea what to do. I run over to my supervisor's office and tell her was going on. She immediately jumps into action and radios EMS while clearing the area around Beth so she doesn't hurt herself. Some of the other workers starts gathering around. All out of concerned and freaked out, these are 16 and 17 year olds. EMS eventually gets there and supervisor rides off with her. 

The whole things freaked me out and she turned out to be ok. It turns out she ran out of her medication and was waiting for the weekend to get paid so she can get prescription refilled. We did find out a little later that she found out at the hospital she was pregnant again. 

TL DR: I walk in on a woman I used to work with, who hasn't had a seizure is years, has one at work supervisor saves the day.",TalesFromRetail
t3_curcqe,"I know I said I didn't want it, but I want it.NOW.","This is from way back like before wifi and all tills being computerised, in a non chain DIY store.

Lady comes in with a list of things her plumber has told her she needs for her bathroom make over, she wants them delivered on Friday so the plumber can do the job on Saturday ok no problem I go through the list and check stock and put the stuff in a box ready for delivery, everything goes smoothly until we come to the radiator, we don't keep them in stock, but we can order them and get them within a couple of days, but just need to check with the supplier.

I get the catalogue to check for the code number to order it, when she spots a fancy chrome towel rail on the page and tells me she wants that. Great I get the code and ask the manager to check availability and price for the lady to OK before we go on with the order, price is ok and we can have one by Wednesday, lady is happy pays for everything but the radiator just in case of problems and goes on her merry way.

A couple of days later she comes back in and cancels the radiator as she was looking through some trade books and found a chain DIY store that has them cheaper, and though she wasn't rude she managed to convey the you people are taking advantage of me vibe.

So Friday comes, out goes her delivery of plumbing supplies and ... Then comes the phone call.

Lady. Where is the radiator?

Me. What radiator? 

Lady. The chrome towel rail, I ordered it last week, I need it for tomorrow .

Me. You came in and cancelled the order, you said you were getting it elsewhere. 

Lady. I know but they didn't have the right one so I need the one I ordered NOW.

Me. We cancelled the order with our suppliers, we don't have it, I can reorder it and get it to you next Wednesday.

Lady. That is no good my plumber is coming tomorrow I WANT it now.

Me. Let me get my manager for you.

Put her on hold, buzzed the office and let the manager deal with it.

She spent half an hour on the phone with the manager alternating between begging, demanding and crying to try and get a towel rail/ radiator to magically appear over night. She had to wait until Wednesday to get it. Ah I miss retail lol.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cug4v0,Turns out expiration dates can be important. Or. How I met the HazMat crew!,"From a long time ago, when I first started working auto parts.

A customer came in looking for carburetor dip. (this stuff if you're interested  [https://www.berrymanproducts.com/products/cleaning-degreasing/berryman-chem-dip-professional-parts-cleaner/](https://www.berrymanproducts.com/products/cleaning-degreasing/berryman-chem-dip-professional-parts-cleaner/)  ) For those that don't know, this is a can of extremely strong solvents made for dropping a whole carburetor into. It will strip enamel/grease/carbon. It's usually sold in 1 gallon sizes, looks like a can of paint. It's also sold in 5 gallon containers, but nobody ever gets that. This guy wants a 5 gallon.

I look it up and it says we have one in stock? I've never seen it that I can think of? I head to the back and start searching.

The back of the store has the wholesale counter, and that's where I found it. Literally buried in bags of oil absorbent, with a lot of dust. I got everything out from in front and on top of it, and luckily they have a metal ring on the top to grab it by.

I grab the can and slide it towards me and then hoist it up.

The can tore apart like wet toilet paper. This stuff gushed everywhere, luckily it just got my shoes. I'm holding the top of the container in my hand staring at the massively spreading mess. Guys at the wholesale desk are freaking out, then the floor starts smoking. The fumes were extremely choking. We all rushed to open all the doors and rushed everyone out of the store.

Called 911 because those fumes were extremely harsh, they sent in hazardous materials crew. From the time of the spill of their arrival was maybe 30 minutes? Took about 3.5 hours before we were cleared to enter the store.

Lots of ruined products around the spill, but the floor was the worst. It ATE the floor. There was a distinct crater where the tile was gone.

One of the HazMat guys showed me the can, which was over 3 years past it's expiration date. Turns out the expiration date is for the can, not the chemicals.",TalesFromRetail
t3_culw9e,"""Oh Honey, Stop Making Me Look Bad!""","I work at a store where everything costs a dollar. I don't have many issues with mean/rude customers either. Most of the issues I've had have been from other co-workers. 

Anyways, this happened a few months ago and the store was pretty dead. I was working with this older woman (we'll call her OW) who was at the register behind me.

It being slow I didn't feel like standing at the register doing nothing so I was going around picking stuff up, putting it away, and just generally cleaning up the front area. OW stood at her register and watched me do all this while I occasionally came back to ring out customers who came up front. Until a woman walked up that OW seemed to know. 

I didn't think anything of it and got back on register to ring out two people who'd come to my line. OW was continuing to talk her friend, and I spotted a second woman in line we'll call Lady. Lady stood by waiting politely for OW to finish her conversation. I'm still at my register, expecting OW to ring her friend out and then start helping Lady. 

Guess what doesn't happen? OW just leaves her friend's stuff on the belt, looks at Lady, glances at her stuff placed on the belt, and then turns to keep talking to her friend. This has gone on for about five minutes now and I can see Lady is getting visibly frustrated. I step up and very quietly say to Lady while grabbing her stuff, 

""Ma'am, why don't I ring out on my register? I'm so sorry."" 

Lady: -look of annoyance and utter relief- ""Thank you."" 

I start ringing her out and Lady and I end up having our own whispered conversation.  

Lady: -quietly- Who is that woman she's talking too?

Me: I don't know, I've never seen her before. I guess they haven't seen each other in a while?

Lady: -slightly irritated at OW now- She could've just rang me out. 

Me: -as I'm bagging her stuff- Yeah, and you don't have a lot either. I'm sorry, I should've gotten you sooner.

Lady: -to me- It's not your fault, I thought you were closed. -offers me a bright smile-

Me: -smiles back- 

I wish her a good day and Lady walks out. OW keeps talking to her friend for another ten minutes, rings her out, and tells her to have a good day. She finally turns her attention to me and comes around the register with a sweetly sick smile on her face. 

OW: Honey, you didn't need to do that.

Me: Do what?

OW: Ring that lady up, I was going to get her. 

Me: -decides to take the diplomatic approach- I didn't want to interrupt your conversation so I just rang her up. 

OW: Honey, I haven't seen her in AGES. I was going to ring her up. 

Me: Well, you were taking to long. 

OW: -slightly irritated- Well Honey, I'm older, I'm not as fast as you  younger people. 

Me: -because I'm a smartass- So? 

OW: -seeing she can't cow me goes back to her register and silently glares at me-

Rest of the shift was okay for the most part, though at one point instead of going to the manager about how she was feeling tired from ""standing up for so long"" to ask for a chair OW got customers to do it for her. Our manager was literally in the aisle right of front of us and all OW would have had to do was either raise her voice a bit to get our manager's attention. OW also got customers to lecture/yell at our manager who was super confused about ""making a woman who was in pain to keep working"". Manager then told OW if she was in pain she could've just said something and she'd either let her head home for the day or let her sit down for a bit. 

After OW left (early might I add) manager asked me about the incident with OM's friend and the Lady. I told her what happened. 

Never saw OW show up for another shift again.",TalesFromRetail

They didn't like the selection of some random food, I think it was rice. Well they were getting really mad at me because I was the one there in front of them. It comes to the point where they threw a pickle at me (we sell those bagged pickles up by the registers) and hit me in the cheek. I was so pissed but my manager saw it and came out to help. My manager was actually backing me up for once and is very upset with the customer. Manager asks me to go call the police since we have them on camera doing it. But before I step out to call, an off duty cop comes in and sees the customer with my manager. The off duty officer asks me if everything is okay I told her no the customer (my manager was at this point screaming at) had assaulted me and we had it on camera. She told me not to worry and she called one of her co-workers and he was there lickity split. Since I was the one attacked they asked if i wanted to press charges, told him hell yeah I do.

t3_culvzw,MUH WEAVER COOKIES,"When I was a kid, my parents owned a small grocery store in Eastern Kentucky. My mother dealt with all types, and she was a pretty tough. She kept a nickel-plated Colt .32 revolver in a drawer behind the counter, for just the type of guy I’m about to tell you about.

I was probably seven or so, which would make the year 1974, I guess. This old guy comes in, probably 60 or so, grizzled, greasy, toothless, chawin’ on terbackky. Anyway, he mumbles something to my mom, walks up and down the aisles a few times, comes back to the counter.

“I want some weaver cookies,” he mumbled.


“I’m sorry, sir,” mom said. “Would you repeat that, please!”


“Weaver cookies!” louder this time.


“Sir, I don’t know what you mean,” mom replied.


“I know you got ‘em, gimme some damn Weaver cookies!” louder and becoming agitated.


“Sir, I really don’t know what you mean,” mom said. “Why don’t you just show me?”


“Why the hell should I have to show you what a gawd damn Weaver cookie is?! Are you stupid or what?!”


By this time, my mother had her hand in the drawer where she kept the revolver.

“Sir, please lower your voice. I’m going to ask you to leave now.”


Guy glared menacingly at mom, then stalked back through the aisles again. My mom took the opportunity to slip the revolver into her pocket. Guy comes stalking back up to the counter and triumphantly slams a box of vanilla wafers on the counter. “SEE?! GAWD DAMN WEAVER COOKIES!”


In a moment that I will never forget, my mom took the revolver out of her pocket, pointed it at the guy’s face, and said, “Thank you for teaching me what Weaver cookies are, sir. Now, get the hell out of my store and never show your face here again.”

t3_culk8o,I don't work in that Department...,"This happened last night. Im on mobile so there is that.
Background: I got a job at a local department store as the Frozen Department lead(I've only been lead for about 3 months) which for any one who doesn't means I have no idea where anything is in this store anymore(the store got a remodel so every thing got moved around). I also talk to so many people that I don't remember what the customers look like unless they are regulars, so knowing her on sight is impossible.

Last night was inventory night! Fun time for everyone right? Not really, but any way I'm almost finished with counting everything in my freezer. I just needed to put about 20 cases of frozen waffles out so the display was full for the next day. So there I am stocking at 9:00pm (i was supposed to be done at 6pm) when this woman comes stomping up to me pushing a half filled grocery cart and starts to a cost me.

Lady: WHERE ARE THE JUICE BOXES!? I'VE BEEN UP AND DOWN EVERY AISLE AND HAVEN'T FOUND THEM! 

Me:(standing infront of the display bunker in the meat department. Where the waffles are displayed) I'm sorry i don't work in the Grocery Department but i can go find someone who can help.

Lady: PLEASE DO! THIS IS RIDICULES I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING IN THIS STORE!

Me:(walks back to the stockroom where my boss is working on hanging the inventory lists) Hey boss what aisle are the juice boxes in?
 
He tells me it's in aisle 9, so i head back out only to find that the lady i was trying to help had vanished. So i shrug and go back to work. This was apparently the exact WRONG thing to be. I found out that after i left to get the aisle for her, she had wondered up to customer service to complain that ""that Shaved haired bitch""(me, half my head is shaved) was rude to her and didn't help her out. She did all this as she swore and yelled about how ""she used to work in retail so she knows the rules and everyone is required to know where everyone is""

t3_cuhz1d,"No, I don't want to talk to your husband on the phone","This is a very common occurrence at my store, so I'm going to tell one version of a story that happens at least 1-2 times a week to me.

~side note: this got a little longer than I intended, because context is important~

I work at a store where you have to pay an annual membership fee to shop, but get bulk merchandise at wholesale prices. Yeah, that one. When you have a membership, you get a card with your name and picture on it that the cashier has to scan to start the purchase (we literally have to. The register is locked without a membership scan or a key from a supervisor). We also offer a credit card that is linked to your membership card, and can get a two-in-one card with both sets of information on it. Because the credit cards are linked to the membership, they also have your picture on them.

Technically, the membership cards are non-transferable. Only the person whose name and face is on the card can use them to shop. Most of the time, we'll overlook this, especially if the cardholder is there with the person trying to use it (some people make a big fuss and supervisors will almost always let it go ""just this once,"" so it's not worth the fight). This, however, does NOT apply to the credit card, because it's a CREDIT CARD.

Cue our exemplar:

A lady comes in and gives me a membership/credit card with a picture of a man who, age-wise, could be her husband. I scan the membership, but hold on to the credit card because people tend to snatch them up as soon as I put them down to check out the items, hoping I didn't get a good look. When she asks to put the items on the card, I ask if the man in the picture is here. 

""No, but that's my husband.""

""I'm sorry, but I can't charge someone else's card unless they're physically present.""

""You can see my ID, we have the same last name.""

(Cue the internal eyeroll, because you and your spouse are the only two people in North America with the last name Chang/Smith/Gonzales/Johnson)

""I'm sorry, but he has to be here for me to charge his card""

""I can call him, do you want to talk to him?""

(Eyeroll #2 because you can call literally anyone right now)

""No, I don't"" 

Then is the reason I chose this story. A tactic I had never encountered before.

""Please?""

Now, note, this is not desperate, she isn't begging me because otherwise her family won't eat dinner tonight. It almost sounded like the way a child asks for a toy her mom won't buy her.

""No, I can't charge someone else's card unless they're here.""

""Please?""

""Nope."" 

""Fine. I didn't want to have to do this.""

t3_cud9zi,Customer made my brain leak from my ears...,"This is an encounter I had with a customer when I was working at a significantly large retail chain, founded in Arkansas. This was years ago, around the time that flat screen TVs were gaining popularity but tube TVs were still a thing, to tell you how long ago it was.
The TV thing is relevant.
So anyway, I used to work at a retail store, doing all sorts of stuff. Inventory, collecting carts, carry outs for customers etc.
One day I did a carry out of a 30ish inch tube TV for a customer. Loaded it up in the wagon, and brought it to the curb for them to pull up and I’d help them load it into the car. 
Now this was a big awkward box, and wouldn’t fit into the door of the sedan the customer pulled up in. It wouldn’t even fit in the trunk of the car. Or at least the trunk wouldn’t close. 
There was a way that it could fit in the car, without the issue of having to tie down the trunk lid. I offered to do something that we weren’t supposed to do without asking, but if the customer was ok with it, go right ahead.
I told him that I could remove the tv from the box, then it would fit into the back seat, then I’d collapse the box, fold it up and load that stuff if he wanted it, into the trunk.
He said we couldn’t do that.
When I asked why not, he replied that all the seats were taken in the car. And sure enough, his family, who I hadn’t noticed before, were all there 5 people in total, 5 seats...
As I contemplated how I’d angle it into the trunk and began to cut some twine to tie down the lid he asked the following. This is a direct quote by the way, I have unfortunately committed to memory.

“Why ya’ll sell TVs too big to fit in people’s cars?”

Well, my mind popped, and I don’t remember loading it into the trunk and tying it closed but I must have because he was soon gone, having shattered my hopes for humanity.

I am however willing to admit, maybe he was trying to joke around, but it didn’t feel like a joke...still that thought is the only thing that gives me hope sometimes. That he was just being “funny” especially since he’d already bred...",TalesFromRetail

I try to help as many people as I can, but its hopeless to try and get to everyone, as were required to do.  

I approach a woman and ask if I can help her.  She responds that I can indeed help her; I should fire myself and everyone else who works there.  I was at a point where I didn't even blink an eye.  I just apologized, offered again to help her find what she was looking for and had a decent conversation with her.

He walked over to the woman and began to talk to her and I could see that she was becoming more and more irate as she was asked simple questions and eventually she just stormed out of the store, severely unsatisfied with the fact that we did not know what paint she bought last week, based on the minimum information she provided to us.

t3_cugmpv,Bowl Guy,"Somewhat long story in two parts due to it being 2 different days. 

I used to work at a books and knick knacks kind of place. Unfortunately my work closed a couple months ago and oh boy was that a huge disaster. Every random person came out of the woodwork to give us a hard time on “how dare you close!” as if it was us the workers who decided this and not cooperate. Anyways, with a closing sale everything that’s not nailed down is for sale, shelving units, bulletin boards, extension cords, literally anything and everything. If you didn’t see a price on an item, people usually would bring up whatever object it was and ask us. We had a liquidation company price common items and whatever they didn’t price, my store manager was in charge of pricing. 

*Back Story*

We were about 2/3 the way through the closing sale and had condensed a few products and sections down. Every couple hours we had to rearrange to make things better presentable but it was hectic to stay on top of it. One of the Knick knacks we sold were small rocks. You don’t just have rocks on a shelve so naturally they were kept in a bowl. I had just checked out a customer who bought a few of them but I hadn’t realized they were the last of them. 

 *Bowl Guy Act 1*

Bowl guy brought up this bowl that had held the rocks (which was now empty). There was a sign in it that said “Rocks $2.99!” My Coworker E realized he wanted to buy it and called my manager to the front so that he could price it. She took the rock sign out of the bowl and threw it away. After no response from my manager, I went to the back room to see if he had heard and realized he was occupied in the bathroom. I went back to Coworker E to say the manager was “a little busy at the moment but would be up momentarily”. 

Cue Bowl Guy freaking out. He demanded the bowl for $2.99 because otherwise it was false advertisement and we didn’t need the manager. We didn’t realize what he was talking about and he demanded Coworker E bring the sign out of the trash. She did and showed him it was “Rocks $2.99”. He was still pissed was now demanding for the manager. I told him again that the manager was busy. He started yelling about why couldn’t the manager take two seconds to come prove him right because he was a paying customer. I got pissed and told him the manager was in the bathroom but would be out very shortly now. Bowl Guy peaked and said “F*** you I’ll be back and I better get it for cheaper. Your manager is not going to be happy with you” With that explosion the guy stormed out. 

Not even 30 seconds later, my manager showed up. After telling him the ordeal, he said he probably would have just given the bowl to the guy (manager was so done with the sale and peoples attitudes that he just didn’t care anymore) but that now he wouldn’t sell the bowl to the guy at all. He asked if any of my coworkers wanted the bowl or the identical one that was still in use if we wanted them for free . Coworker E did so we stuck some sold signs on the bowl and identical bowl. (Btw from the moment Bowl Guy came up to the time he left was maybe 5 minutes, it’s not like the manager was purposely dragging his feet, just needed to go, give him a break)

*Bowl Guy Act 2*

Bowl Guy came back 2 days later. He walked around the entire store looking for the bowls, obviously blind to the identical bowl that was still in use with the sold sticker on it. He purposely went to different coworker, Coworker B, when he came to the check stand. He yelled at her “you sold my item! You were supposed to hold it for me and I can’t find it anywhere. I told you I was coming back for it today (he didn’t). Where is it! I better get it for free this time after all this nonsense!”

My original Coworker E from his first visit stepped forward and told him she didn’t know what happened to the bowl. Bowl Guy was once again pissed.  This time the manager was out of town leaving Assistant Manager in charge (who happened to be on break at the time), which actually meant Coworker E and I were in charge because we were both floor managers (which were were about to explain). 
He belittled us by saying “shouldn’t all 3 of you be in high school? Let me talk to an adult.”

Coworker E “We are adults, none of us are in high school” 

Bowl Guy “bet you wish you still were though, cuz you sure look like that’s where you belong”

Coworker B “I’ve been married to my husband for a couple years now and we have kids. If I were in high school I’d be years away from all that, I wouldn’t trade” (She’s late 20s and looks nothing like a high schooler)

Myself “yeah I just got my double bachelors degree and I’d hate to have to work towards that again” (Im mid 20s, I do look young and I hate it) 

Coworker E “I’m two years into my degree and I’m getting married next month, I’d hate to have to give up my fiancé for high school” ( she’s early 20s and looks it)

Very defeated Bowl Guy tried to make up for his mistake “oh well it’s a compliment you all look so young. Let me know if that bowl turns up” and he left. He never came back. 

Tl;dr: My work was closing and bowl guy wanted to buy a display bowl, which needed to be priced by Store Manager. Bowl guy wanted the price of what it was displaying and threw a fit when he couldn’t get it. He came back later, yelled, insulted my coworkers and myself, tried to save face when we told him off, then left.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cufey9,Never Shop While Intoxicated,"I used to work for a popular kids store a few years ago. It’s one that you’d probably not wanna take your kids into as you might end up spending a lot on add ons to it.

One night I was working the floor by myself for the last hour of store operations. This guy (probably late 20’s), his daughter (the most adorable but slightly spoiled child I’ve ever seen), and the guy’s friend (who smelled of a certain plant) walk into the store. Per usual I explain how the store works, the daughter picked out a cute toy, and I left them to pick out the rest of their stuff. 

Maybe 20 mins later, Dad brings a basket full of add ons while his daughter places the original toy on the counter. I’m making small talk to both of them, asking the girl how old she was, if dad was treating her to the toy for her birthday, ect. I read off the total to him, $200+ for everything. Since he and his buddy both were... not fully there in the moment and I was getting side affects of the plant smell off them, dad laughs and looks at his daughter, 

“you pretty fuckin spoiled for a random day at the mall.” 

I laugh awkwardly and finish the transaction. Duaghter runs off happily with her $200+ toy and dad walks out like he’s a baller still. 

To this day I wonder if when he sobered up did he question where $200 went while his kid played with her toy and add ons.",TalesFromRetail
t3_ctylph,"""You are here to serve me.""","This happened back in the late 90s when I was a teen working my first retail job at a popular department store.

The store closes at 9pm, there a numerous signs and announcements are made.  

At 9pm, I vacuum my area and tidy up, then do a final walkthrough to make sure no customers are still in my area of the store.  Seeing no one at 9:15 PM, I close my register and hand the money into the office.  I notice I forgot my keys, so still clocked in I return to my register to get them.  Of course there is a customer waiting at the register. 

The customer wanted to see a pair of shoes.  I told her the store was closed and the register was shut down, but I would be happy to get the shoes for her and if she liked them I would hold them for her until the next day.

""No, you are here to serve me.""

I was caught off guard by this statement, but quickly responded with, ""only until 9pm, since it is after that, I am leaving.""  

I left the sales floor, told the manager, clocked out and left.

t3_ctukvy,Now that's what I call blatant shoplifting,"Just a short one today that happened a few about ago but still makes me go ""Are you kidding me?""

I work at a discount retail store that unfortunately has to deal with a lot of shoplifting. It's a mostly found out after the fact type of thing, people stuffing things in purses or pockets. We have security devices on a lot of things but thieves will still figure out how to get them off one way or another and we end up finding broken hard tags in pockets of other clothing and such (which is a pain because it sets the door alarm off and we have to check the purchases of confused innocent customers).

We've even found blood stains on clothing from people hurting themselves trying to get tags off wtf..

But blatant out in the open shoplifting is rare and weird when it happens and it happened today on my shift.

I was cashiering and starting a large purchase for a lady when a man comes in from the 'Returns Only' line. I don't think much of it cause people never seem to pay attention to the sign that says where the line starts anyway and there was no one else aside for him and the lady there anyway. He sats down one of those great big laundry baskets full of clothing, along with a set of sheets and a comforter set and just leans against the end of my counter. He sat it down really close to the lady's stuff so I ask if they are together.

The guys just replied, jokingly. ""No, don't think she wants anything to do with this.""

I very distinctly hearing an accent I thought sounded cajun. Yeah, I thought he sounded like Gambit from X-men is exactly where my brain went.

Anyway, the lady's order is taking a bit and a few more people are now in line but not backed up very much though I do have to ask people to not line up in the return line and direct them to the regular line. Par for the course for my job.

Just as I have finished the first lady's order the door alarm goes off and I look up, expecting to see some customer has walked too close to the sensors again to the like...only the see the guy with the cute accent bolting out the door with his full basket of clothes, some of which have screaming alarm tags on them that are now going off.

""Sir?"" I call after him, followed a much much louder ""**SIR!**"" 

The second one I must have been channeling my mother's teacher voice because literally everyone in the store could hear me. But by that time the guy had jumped into a car parked right in front of the store and sped off. I composed myself, picked up my walkie and informed the manager what happened before going back to checking people out. Of course the other customers were as shocked as I was and many of them kindly stuck around to give addition details to the manager when she came up to get my account.

It turns out the guy had an at least one accomplice, his girlfriend/wife. It was actually her grabbing perfume (which are kept in individual locked keepers) off the front display and running out the door that set the alarm off in the first place. Those keepers are going to be a pain to open without the special key. In fact I hope all their pilfered goods get ruined trying to get the security tags off, idiots. Oh and because they had the getaway car right in front of the building, the security cameras probably got a good view of the license plate. Aside from that there is not much the store can do.

It was just so wild. Why did he even bother standing a line? Did they really plan this whole thing out or did the GF decided to yonk some goods and he then had to grab his stuff and run? I don't know.

 I was told to call another store to see if they had a certain item in stock. Ok....

So I ask the customer which store she would like to pick it up from... 

Her, ""Oh we were just told we could have it brought/shipped from any other store.""

Me... ""No we don't ship between store's."" (I have only been at my store as lower management for 6 months and I am furious as to how employees will go pick up said product at another store On Their Own Time, plus not getting gas $ back) I get it if it's an emergency but...

One of the people who pre-ordered came in today. He got the dates mixed up, and thought that launch day was today. He was very excited to get his phone. I told him that the launch date was in fact tomorrow, not today, and that I could not legally release the phone. He cannot make it tomorrow, but could come next week. No problem, we will hold your pre-order until you can come get it. He says that sounds good and leaves.

I left to use the washroom, and when I came back, my manager was finishing up with him. He cancelled his pre-order because he couldn't make it tomorrow. And he wanted to either pre-order it again tomorrow (how?), or from another location, so he could pick it up next week. Bearing in mind that we will be holding his pre-ordered phone until he can pick it up. We won't be selling it.

My manager just did it, to make him happy. But both of us were confused as to why he wanted to pre-order again when we would have held the phone until he was able to pick it up, along with his GWP.

t3_cttf7i,“Never do anything for anyone!”,"A man (what is the name for a male Karen?) came in to the store I work in today, wanting to buy sunglasses as a gift for his wife. He bypassed staff and spoke to the owner of the store, who happened to be behind the counter today, and got special permission to buy two pairs so that his wife could choose the pair she liked, and he would return the other pair. 

We usually only offer exchange or store credit for returns, but we can make exceptions when needed. My boss wanted to help this guy with his romantic gesture, so he decided to give this guy seven days to bring the extra pair back to get a refund. 

The man was back within a couple of hours to return the more expensive pair of the two, except he had put the cheaper pair in the box. My boss caught the swap immediately and told the guy he needed the correct box to return the glasses (not accusing him at all, he wanted to assume it was a mistake).

Of course the guy huffed and puffed and couldn’t believe how we were putting him out by not refunding him. He demanded the refund and said he’d bring the correct box by soon. No dice. No box, no return. 

He stormed out and returned later in the day, still completely steaming and refusing to speak, just tossing the box on the counter. Then, when his refund was being processed, he tried to again get the return for the more expensive pair, even though his wife had kept those ones. 

After he left (hopefully forever), my boss told us, in mock frustration, “Never do anything for anyone!”",TalesFromRetail

t3_cthp8i,"""You gave bad customer service""...for knowing how to do my job from memory?","This just happened a few days ago, compared to other stories(even my own) it's not that bad, but it's still pretty frustrating since it shows the absurd standards people hold their expectations regarding customer service.

I work as a mobile representative selling prepay(think tracfone, total wireless, ect.) and postpay(contracts with most major carriers) in a big box store type location. I am not an employee of the store I work in, my employer has just been contracted out by the store to do these types of sales so unlike the people who work around me in the department I'm stationed at it is quite literally my job to know about phones. However most people assume I am part of the store proper despite the fact that my uniform is completely different to other employees and that my actual company's logo is displayed clearly on my identification card I wear at all times. This is not that important for this story in particular but it does show that I know what I'm talking about when it comes to what I do.

I had just started my shift when I had an older woman come up to my desk like she was in a rush. She starts saying how she's with X-carrier on a contract, but through an X-carrier branded store, not the big box. She noticed that we have a better deal on a popular last gen phone(it's truly a ludicrously low price for the quality of the phone) and that she wants to set up another line for it. Because she is not on an X-carrier contract with the big box store I work out of I cannot touch their account(and they cannot touch ours, they are completely different which is why we give better deals on phones) and to get the phone deal through us she would have to have her entire account transferred over to us before doing anything, and in order to do even that all of the phones she has on the account(upwards of 4) have to be completely paid off. I had actually just dealt with a similar case a few days prior and that was the same procedure we had to go through. At this she huffs and says that she was in the store 6 months ago(I have only been working there about 2 at this point) and that the person she talked to then said something different. Did not tell me *what* the person had said different, just that it was different.

From my coworker I know that 6 months ago the newly promoted ""boss"" of our location was so bad at her job that she would just lie to get sales, so I ask her if it was one of our employees or one of the store's. She says ours and gives a description that sounds similar to how my coworker depicted the old ""boss"". I tell her that either the employee she spoke with gave her the incorrect information or that in the 6 months since the last quote the policy had changed(which, while unlikely in this scenario, has actually happened in the past.) and that the only way to proceed would be in the way previously described.

The woman starts muttering quietly under her breath, says ""Ok,"" mutters more, then turns to leave. I tell her to have a good day, and she comes back and starts an almost gentile tirade about how she was ""disappointed in my customer service"" and that she was going to a different location of the store(not all of which have my company operating in them) because I told her different from what she expected. When I ask for an explanation she says, ""You didn't look anything up,(Pointing to my terminal where I make contract sales) you should have at least offered to look it up.""

Again, similar situation I had mere days ago. The only difference was that case only had one phone where as she had four.

So I guess knowing protocol by heart and informing customers of them is bad service....if you don't ""look them up""?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit to clarify the protocol I was referring to since there's been a lot of questions:

If a customer comes in saying that they are on a contract with Provider X and that they want to make a change to their account(new phone line, upgrade, etc.) through my company, but their contract is not with my company's branch of Provider X(say it's through a retail branded store of Provider X or the like), then myself and everyone else at my company cannot touch that account at all; not even in a ""*you aren't with us so we will not do it*"" way, in a ""*if I look up your account through our systems it will deny me access to making any changes because I am not authorized to do so*"" way. The reason is because plans my company sets up for Provider X and the plans the offshoot retail locations of Provider X has are two completely different plans, which is why the prices are often different. Therefore, the only way that they can have my company do anything with their account is to change what type of plan it is(note,***the customer won't see any difference in the payments/bills on the phones they already have on their accounts***) and transfer it over to us so we can set up the new whatever. This is why to even do the transfer all phones on the account must be paid off so that there's only the service charge to worry about, not monthly phone payments that the other contract set up.

I'm not saying that it's good protocol, or that it's not frustrating, but that is the way we have to operate.",TalesFromRetail

This crazy customer came in and tried to return a mirrored item that had a big chunk missing out of it, right next to the barcode. I quickly do a little research and find that the associate that sold it to her is meticulous in looking for damage (to avoid doing anything else). So I know that item did not leave my store that way. 

Me: ma'am with this item being damaged, I cannot return it per company policy. The policy states items have to be returned in sellable condition. 
CC: well y'all obviously sold it to me that way. And my receipt says you have to give me my money back. 

I take her receipt and flip it over, physically pointing to and showing her the lines that states it has to be in sellable condition. 

CC: you sold it to me this way. So you HAVE TO take it back. It's defective!
Me: ma'am, because the item is damaged and it did not leave the store damaged, I will not return it. 

CC: (yelling at this point) WELL THEN YOU CAN JUST KEEP IT. I HAVE NO USE FOR IT ANYWAYS! 

Crazy customer starts to leave in a huge huff. I am still holding the item in my hand. She turns around and angrily tells me to ""give me my...""

Had my hand not still been slightly on it, she would have injured me, as it was a quite heavy piece of decor. And left the store. 

About 20 minutes go by. I have put the item in our damage bin. I get I phone call that customer service is on the phone for me. 

CS: I have a customer on the line saying that you refused a return for her item and called her a liar to her face.

Me: Not true. I would never call a customer a liar. I informed the customer that I wouldn't return her damaged item per policy and she proceeded to try and throw it at me. 

CS: well we can't call our customers liars. We need to make this right. (Getting very aggressive with me) 

Me: again, I did not call her a liar. 

CR: (interrupting) we can't treat our customers that way. We have to make it right. If I send her back into your store, would you personally give her her money back? 

I am infuriated at this point because the Customer service rep is completely believing the customer and claiming that I am the problem. 

Me: Because the customer tried to throw the item at me, no I will not. 

CS: so. You're willing to lose a customer and have them escalate because of this?? 

Me: yes.

CS: well I'm going to have to inform your regional manager of this and your attitude. Goodbye. *Hangs up on me* 

I'm assuming that the drama is over. Unfortunately for me, it isn't. 
About 15 minutes later, I'm informed there is another phone call for me. But they're unsure who it is. 

Me: Thank you for holding, how can I help you?? 

CC: I got my way. Customer service is sending me a new item. She said that you were snotty to her as well. You should have just done what I wanted and returned the item. You should NEVER speak to a customer like that and call them names. 

Me: ma'am I never called you any names at all.. 

CC: (screaming) YES YOU DID! YOU CALLED ME NAMES AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET FIRED! I WORK IN RETAIL AND WOULD NEVER TREAT A CUSTOMER LIKE THAT. YOU SHOULD'VE JUST DONE WHAT I WANTED. I'M GONNA CONTACT YOUR REGIONAL MANAGER TOO! *hangs up*

English is not my native language, exuse me if there is strange sentences structures .

Last year, I worked for a while in a dairy shop, we would sell cheese, cream, butter... and we were also making our own ice creams.
It was in a small village, so most of the regular customers would have an ""account"" where we write their purchases and they would come later and clear it.

Maybe once a week, an old man would step in to get a piece of cheese or some butter. He was really nice and would always talk a bit with us.
He would also take an ice cream every time.
Most of the time, he would ask us to add what he came for on his account.
But he would always pay the ice cream cash! 

I did not ask him why, but the owner of the shop later told me that he love the ice cream but his wife does not want him to eat it. He was paying it immediately so she would not know that he had some because there was no traces of it in his account and she would not know.

t3_ctpruv,An ACL warrior,"For those not in Australia, ACL = Australian Consumer Law.

I was fortunate to not have to deal with this man however my friend a coordinator had to deal with him for over an hour on a busy Sunday.

So the customer walks in with a phone that, according to him, is faulty. Its about 16 months old and we offer 24 months warranty. He has his receipt and everything so we assumed he'd be a decent customer. We have to run faulty products through our system and it will give us a remedy to provide. Due to us retail staff not having qualifications to assess a phone, especially this late into the warranty period, we have to send it off for repair to the manufacturer. The repair process involves:

1. Assessment to determine fault and basic troubleshooting
2. If there is a fault, with phones they'll generally replace hardware first.
3. If all else fails, they will send a replacement back.

So my friend (let's call her Judy), runs it through the system and it says it needs to be sent off for repair. She lets the customer know and his face changes.

Judy - friend/coordinator

Bob- phone guy

Bob: no I want a refund

Judy: unfortunately it has to be sent off for repair. This is what our policy and system provides as the remedy. If it deemed faulty they will fix it or-

Bob: no that's against the law give me my refund.

Judy: it isn't we are by law offering a remedy

Bob: I understand you people don't know anything about ACL, but \*I\* do and it says you have to give me a refund

&amp;#x200B;

When I heard that I got pissed for Judy. She also stood there a bit shocked as well. We go through training twice a year on consumer law, and we have an abundance of booklets that we can give to customers, as well as read for ourselves, that talk about the law and how our policies go. Trust me, if what we were doing was illegal, we would have been in trouble years ago because it has always been this way.

&amp;#x200B;

Good ol Judy despite this tries her best to help him as well as not giving him what he wants. Similar back and forths go for over an hour. He left at one point then came back, his mother (who looked like a total Karen) would bitch about Judy and the company in his ear, so no wonder why he's like this.

&amp;#x200B;

At one point the store manager got involved and explained to him why we have to do this.

&amp;#x200B;

Bob: I am telling you that it is faulty it is a major fault in this model

Store manager (SM): we still have to send it off for repair. Us staff are NOT qualified to assess something like a phone as well as handle things with personal data on it. You can say that it is faulty but we still need to give it to qualified people to assess it.

Bob: b-but \*some more back and forth I couldn't hear well

\*SM: You can send it off to \[phone brand\] yourself and if they give us authorisation to refund it/replace it, then we can do that. However you still need to send it off to them and it'll save you shipping if you do it through us.

Bob: \*more back and forth\*

He eventually agreed to send it off for repair and purchased a cheap smart phone as a temp replacement. He left and I haven't seen him again. I'm glad the manager stuck by my friend and didn't cave into the demands.

tldr: customer unhappy with reasonable remedy we have for faulty phone, proceeds to undermine friend's ACL knowledge, tries to argue for over an hour, still sends it off for repair in the end.

I hate bike racks.

Look if you want to buy one then fine, go nuts, but put it together yourself. Dealing with vague directions and confusing diagrams for an hour is time I don't have. There are three people on the schedule after you and they're all going to be annoyed at me, not you, because I had to work with directions written by people who sucked too much to write for IKEA.

Anyway... I see him come in, so I go in the back to get the parts together. Usually it only takes a minute to grab the keys from the customer and toss them back to me but after a few minutes I still haven't heard from them so I go to the front.

Gary's dealing with him. Apparently the customer has questions. 

""How do I know this is going to work for my bike?""

""Well you were the one that picked this specific bike rack so I imagine it told you on screen it would work...""

""Yes, but what if it doesn't?""

""You picked a universal bike rack. It works with everything. Is it a normal bike?""

""Yes.""

""It's fine.""

""But what about the hitch? Is it compatible? ""

...

""And you'll install the bike rack for me?""

...

""And it's sturdy? I won't have to worry...""

The line behind him is getting longer and longer. I reach over the counter and take the keys while he peppers Gary with more inane questions.

The install goes okay. I only scrape off a bit of skin in my rush to get it done, the heat and humidity are merely chokingly tropical rather than outright sauna-like, and the directions, while belligerently oblique, are at least in English this time.

Despite my making good time I'm asked three times for updates on how it's going. 

""Like sh!t. That's how it's going.""

""Any idea how long it's going to be?""

Poor Eric. He's a sweet kid but has no idea how to deal with me when I'm under pressure. I try to take it easy on him. I fail.

""Exactly as long as I told you the last few times. Dude, come on, let me work!""

Work done I pull the thing out into the parking lot. I swing through the store to see the line is just as long as ever, but I can't help out; the next two installs are already waiting for me. 

And Gary's missing.

On my way out to get the next car I spot him. He's with the bike rack guy answering more questions. Gary is too polite to tell the guy to screw off. I pull up to them and yell out through the window:

""Gary, we have customers waiting inside.""

""I'm a customer too,"" calls out Bike Rack.

""If you have any more questions I left the manual for the rack on the passenger seat. Gary has to go inside now.""

Gary moves off. I wait just long enough for him to be out of sight before I pull away. Bike Rack was saying something at the time... No idea what.

A few hours later at the end of my shift I spot him again. He came back. And he's asking Gary more questions in the parking lot. I don't bail the kid out this time... He's got to learn on his own somehow. 

Oh you think that's it? Nah. He's back the next morning.

Apparently the bike rack is ""too big"". After all the grilling, all the fussing, all of that nonsense, he just discovered it's ""too big"". He wants to return it and have us take the hitch off.

Any other customer it would be no problem. 

But not this guy. Not this time. Not if I have anything to say about it. 

I take my manager aside and negotiate a little. She was going to just give him his money back and have me pull off the hitch, but I tell her what a pain in the a$$ he's been and how we just can't spare the time today to have me do an uninstall.

Turns out she spoke to him when he originally called for the booking. He wasted 20 minutes of her time for what should have been a 2 minute call.

She meets me half way.

We took the bike rack back, but told him he has to keep the hitch. ""Guess I'll have to eat the $230 then,"" he said mournfully. And then said it again. And again. Three separate times, hoping we'd take pity on him and find it in our little hearts to refund that too.

t3_ctie9v,What do you mean you can’t use a coupon that I can’t present to you?,"I work in a fairly well know craft store. My store is the biggest one in my state so it attracts a lot of crafters (and a lot of May I speak to your managers).

So corporate has made an app and wants us to push our customers to get the app so they’ve taken any coupons off the website and have turned them into flyers to download the app (ie. Download the app for 20% off your total purchase). All employees know this  and would never tell us a customer that they could “find coupons on the website” because there just isn’t any there (this is important for later).


So a woman and her husband come up to my register with some fabric as I’m ringing her up she tells me she left her phone at home. She tells me an employee told her there are coupons on the website she can use. 

I tell her all the coupons are on the app for starters, I am not allowed to keep any extra up front secondly, and any coupons on the website wouldn’t work anyways as they’re just promos for the app. Lastly, I explained to her that without the physical coupon (printed or on her phone) I wouldn’t be able to give her the discount anyways. 

Her entire attitude shifts, she gets incredibly short with her answers to me, just pays and storms off grumbling about how they should have gone to a competitor store as if 1: that’s makes a difference to me and 2: she would have gotten different results at another store in this situation. 

TLDR: Women tells me she doesn’t have her phone but heard there’s coupons online she could use. I tell her that no there isn’t and I couldn’t give her the discount anyways without her showing me said coupon. She gets angry and leaves saying she should’ve gone to a competitor store as if she would’ve gotten different results.",TalesFromRetail
t3_ct9070,"Ma'am this phone is split in two, and you want me to what?","Since so many of you enjoyed my previous story and it honestly made me really happy people wanted to hear more so here we go!

It was another work day fixing phones, selling screens, people not understanding that phones have brands and versions, etc. Now for a little more backstory, my boss owns two stores in the same shopping district and when I work at one he works at the other so most of the workday I am completely alone but I am used to it so when people have problems and demand my manager I have to call my boss from the other store from the second floor now this lady was for a lack of better words difficult. And it started like this

Me: Hello how can I help you today?

Lady: Hi I was wondering if you could help me?

Me: Of course! What seems to be the problem?

*Lady pulls out a sandwich ziplock bag with a phone and opens it to show me the phone* ***split in half*** *hanging by the wires inside and places it on the counter*

Lady: Yes I need you to take the pictures off my phone and save them to my google drive so I can access them

I stared at the lady shocked and pick up the phone carefully to not hurt myself and look up at the lady in disbelief

Me: Um if you don't mind me asking.....what happened?

The lady looks away from me and huffs as if I insulted her and crosses her arms and glares to the side

Lady: I just dropped when I got out of my care that's all.

I wanted to ask *While driving?*! But it wasn't my business and didn't want to be rude so I set the phone back down and sighed as I smiled at her

Me: I'm sorry Ma'am but the phone seems to be incredibly damaged and I won't be able to get any information off this phone I apologize

Lady turns back towards me and glares as she huffs again and looks back down at the phone before looking back at me

Lady: I just told you that I dropped it I just want my pictures off the phone you need to help me.

Me: Ma'am, as I tried to explain the motherboard of the phone where this information could be, is incredibly damaged and won't be able to resurface.

Lady: If you won't help me then get someone who can!

I sighed and looked at her tiredly

Me: ...would you like me to call my boss?

Lady: Yes!

I picked up my phone and before I could call him I looked back at her

Me: He works at another store we have here and could take a while for him to get here is that all right?

Lady: Yes I can wait but get him here now!

I sighed and called him and talked to him that someone wanted their phone fixed and wanted him there he said he would be right down I ended the call and looked back at her a smile

Me: He said he would be right down so if you excuse me

I moved to the side and started to help an old man looking for a glitter case for his granddaughter which I gladly helped him with it was a good ten minutes later when my boss came down the way

Boss: *towards the Lady* Hi what can I help you with?

Lady: Yes I need help. I need to get the pictures off my phone. *gestures to the completely broken phone*

Boss looks at the phone then back at the lady before he looks at me with the most WTF face ever I shrugged and we both look at the lady

Boss:....sure

Lady looks like she won the ultimate prize and looks at me with this smug look before she hands my boss her broken phone and a number to contact her when its done she walks away and my boss picks up the phone and puts it back in the ziplock baggy and puts it behind the desk

Me: Sir?

Boss: There is no way I can do anything with how damaged that phone is. I'll call her in a week and make up some BS anyways I'll be at the other store okay?

I nod as he went back to the other store and went about my day thinking about this lady and how she wanted me and my boss to fix a completely broken phone he told me he did call her and say there was nothing he could do and she was not happy at all.

I first met Larry my first week on the job in June of 2018. He came into the store crying because he had lost his cell phone on his way to the store earlier, and someone had taken it.

Larry: did someone turn in a phone here? I lost it on the way here and it’s gone and there are pictures of my fiancé on it.. she died of cancer and these pictures are all I have.

Me: no one turned anything in but give me your name and address and if it comes in I’ll get it back to you. You should make a Facebook post.. I’m sure someone found it.

Larry: I don’t have Facebook..

Me: alright I’ll make a post. If I find it I’ll get it back to you.

So I made the post thinking nothing of it. 

**_Here is where it gets wild._**

Larry: Bless you man. You know, people around here are awful they steal things. But that’s fine because this community is about to be hit by a tidal wave the likes of which Japan has never even seen before and this place will be a mud puddle and no one will survive. Want to know why? Because of this. 

*larry points to his veins in his arm, and then to his hat where he has written bible verses*

Larry: I was murdered when I was three years old in Quebec. Thrown into a river. I died a child. In 1970 I died a child. But I came out of it as a man and that is when I wrote these verses. And now the lord speaks to me and has told me that this community is damned. It’s coming soon. And everyone here will be gone and they will pay for stealing my phone, burning my car, and not allowing me my royalties for the April Wine songs I wrote.

And with that, Larry left. He took his ginger ale and loaf of bread, and walked away without another word. I didn’t see him again until I found his phone, which will be part 2 if there is interest in this series of strange events.",TalesFromRetail

I was placing my lotto order on the phone when a lady came in and just started shouting “SYMPATHY CARDS” without even looking at me. I told her middle aisle to the left, and continued my order.

Her: (shouting still) UMMMMM is this ALL you have?

Me: (sorry again hold on lotto guy) Yes that’s all we have, we don’t keep any stock for greeting cards out back.

Her: WELL HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

Me: Someone comes in monthly and restocks them. There’s no overstock for them.

I continued my lotto order and she starts yelling again.

Her: How much are they?

Me: (sorry again sir) They are $2.30

Her: That’s ridiculous.

I ignored that and just continued my lottery order.

Her: Do you have any $1 cards?

Me: (sir I’m gonna have to call you back I’m sorry) No, those are all the cards we have and they are all $2.30 as the sign above them states.

Her: well I’m not paying $2.30 for a sympathy card.

Me: Okay.



So now she’s just looking at me I guess thinking this is some kind of haggling tactic. She eventually just left muttering to herself. I called back and finished my lotto order, then I went out back to start working on a coke order and the door goes off. It’s her again.

Her: how much are the sympathy cards again?

Me: they’re $2.30.

Her: why?

Me: What?

Her: WHY?

Me: Ummmm I guess the head office decided this was the best price to maintain stock while still turning a profit.

Her: so you’re trying to profit off of people’s grievances? 



I had nothing. What am I supposed to say to that? We’re a store. We are trying to profit off of whatever brings someone into the place to buy things.

t3_ct8m64,Ruined dreams... An auto parts tale.,"So years ago working auto parts, I had a guy come to me who was a bit of an odd customer, at least for us. This is why.

This guy is coming into our large national chain known for having the cheapest parts, with thousands of dollars in gifts cards looking to build a high performance engine. \*record scratch\*

I try to inform him there are much better places he can find what he wants, better, probably cheaper (because I have to outside buy practically everything), but he says no. He has the gift cards for here, because he heard in a radio advertisement once long ago that our company deals with performance parts, so he's been saving up gift cards for *years* for this. Okay.

So this guy has a '71 Mustang. Already has the rest of the car done, this has been his project for years (and he got the rest of the parts elsewhere, wtf). Now he's building the engine, but he doesn't really know what he wants. He explains that it's going to be a daily driver, but he's going to take it to the track as well for road racing. Over the course of the next several months, we built his engine.

I managed to put him together a solid combination built to turn 4000-6500 with decent street manners. Cost him about 30% MORE than it would have elsewhere because of my limitations on where I can order from and pricing. But in the end, the engine machining is done, the engine is IN the car, and now we just need the intake manifold and carb. I order them up, picks them up two days later when they arrived and a few hours later, I get the angriest phone call of my life.

Customer: This F\*\*KING CARBURETOR IS BAD! THE ENGINE IS FLOODED! IT'S RUINED! I'M ON MY WAY NOW! \*click\*

Great, I know this guy doesn't like too far away, so I go outside to smoke first. About halfway through my cigarette, I can HEAR it coming. Multiple loud bangs. It gets close enough to see and it looks like an old locomotive. It's trailing a thick cloud of black smoke. By the time the thing hits the driveway over 30 feet away I can SMELL the fuel in the air. Too bad, it's a beautiful car, dark red paint with black stripes.

He pulls into the parking spot in front of the doors and shuts it down. It diesels on (keeps running with key off) for a solid ten seconds. Reeks of gasoline. He gets out looking really unhappy and pops the hood.

The parts are clearly all installed. This is not good.

Me: Man, I'm so sorry.

Customer: F\*\*k. I don't want to hear it right now, just get me the corporate number.

Me: Alright... Here you go.

I call for him on our phone and let him use it. I go back outside to finish my cigarette. As I walk back outside, I can't help but take a look under his hood. The car is really well put together, all the wire and hose routing is super clean. Then, I see it.

I double take, to make sure what I'm seeing is right, then I touch it and trace it with my finger just to be sure. Then, I went back inside to my customer.

Me: Uh.. Hey.. You need to come with me right now.

Customer: Can it wait, I'm on hold.

Me: No. Just leave it.

He puts the phone down and follows me out to the car, and I point to the fuel pump. Then I trace the fuel line, NOT to the carburetor fuel inlet fitting, but to the 3/8"" vacuum port on the side of the carburetor, made for brake booster vacuum. The high flow fuel pump is literally pumping as much as it can through an open 3/8 hole. The only reason it even ran was the gnarly ignition box and the big camshaft that kept it from hydraulic lock. Oil was also crazy full of fuel.

He sees what I see in a few seconds and just goes pale.

I hung up the phone to corporate and grabbed him some tools, had it plumbed correctly in a few minutes. When he started it up however, white smoke out the exhaust, and you could smell burning oil in the air. The finish on the engine was trashed, needed to be rebuilt.

He admitted to me he was celebrating finishing it at home and hadn't been completely sober when he put it together. He cried a little. Ouch. Drove off in his white cloud of oil smoke, and I never saw him again. Felt bad for him, he loved that car. First and only person I ever even sold those kinds of parts to in years of working there.",TalesFromRetail

I printed up a few notices and put them prominently on display.

The next day, this very large and cheerful (almost aggressively so) middle-aged woman comes in to buy a cheap pay-as-you-moan phone. 

So far, so good; 2 minutes work for a small commission. 

We go over to the counter, between two tills - each with a notice at eye-height and less than arms reach from her, she reaches into her purse and pull out her cheque book.

""Which word don't you understand"" flashed across my mind, but I settled on simply repeating myself.

She picks up a freestanding notice about business cheques and starts waving it at me.

K: WHAT DOES THIS SAY THEN!

Now either she genuinely can't frikking read, or is just really unobservant. It was so tempting to say something snarky, or passive aggressive about either option, but I just didn't have the energy.

What does that even mean? I’ve never had to choose before. For 59 years all I did was stick this card into the chip reader.” I didn’t want to point out that the chip readers have only been around for a few years now and I was baffled that she didn’t know the difference between credit and debit. Surely someone has asked her this before. I try to explain the difference between them and get three words out “so the difference—“ “why would I need to tell you how I’m paying anyway? It isn’t any of your business”. I let her know that “I’m sorry ma’am its just that if you’re paying with a card The computer literally will not allow me to process the payment unless you choose one of the two options. It’s entirely up to you, both are acceptable and it’s just a matter of preference” she then gets mad at me and talks to the manager who says the same thing.

t3_ct0ub8,Armed robbery goes well for criminal. For less than an hour,"Seeing the armed robbery story yesterday reminded me of my first encounter with an armed robber. This happened many years ago at my first retail job.

16 year old me worked at the convenience store near my house on Sunday nights only since I wasn't old enough to sell beer and at the time Sunday sales of beer were forbidden.

I had been working there for about a month when I was robbed.

Slow Sunday about 10:00pm

First female customer comes in (no car but not unusual) and wanders the aisles. Second female customer arrives in a taxi, buys cigarettes and leaves. First female comes to the counter with a six-pack. I tell her it’s Sunday and I can’t sell her beer. She tries to get me to sell it to her and ring it up the next day offering me an extra $10. I tell her no and put the beer on the back counter. She then asks for a hot dog; I turn around to get the boat and bun when I hear the distinctive sound of a revolver being cocked. I turn around and am facing down the barrel of a chrome plated revolver. She demands the money from the register, I comply ($47) she immediately wants in the safe and of course I don’t have access to it. She makes me lie down behind the counter and she leaves.

While I’m on the phone with 911, the second female shows back up wanting to know if the first one was still there because she wanted to “kick her ass.” I ask if she’ll stay and tell the police who the robber is, she replies, “I’ll not only tell them her name I’ll take them to her house!”

Police show up and take the customer up on her offer; 40 minutes later a police officer shows up with the robber in the back of a cruiser and has me ID her.

Side note: when staring down a .357 barrel it appears large enough to walk down.

I quit working for the company when they filed an insurance claim for over $400 dollars on the robbery by including all of the month's shortages.

Its around 8 Pm when this foreign looking lady (she told me later, that she was from Germany) comes in and looks for foreign children's books, no problems I showed her the section. after 5 minutes or so she is back

Her: you don't have a lot of those books

She swipes. A beep. Before selecting her payment type, she begins pulling out coins. She doesn't have enough.

I cancel the transaction, start ringing up someone else. She runs back in and throws a coin on the counter, attempting to run out with her bag. I stop her. We need to start over. But now, she left the card in the car. She runs back out. I inspect the new coin.

&amp;nbsp;

It's large, larger than a quarter. Either an old dollar or a fifty cent piece. ""One half dollar"" it reads. As I thought. But, something is strange still. I turn it over...

&amp;nbsp;

**Confederate States of America**

&amp;nbsp;

what.

&amp;nbsp;

What?

&amp;nbsp;

***WHAT??***

&amp;nbsp;

She returns. I inform her I can't take her coinage.

&amp;nbsp;

""Why?""

&amp;nbsp;

""It's Confederate currency.""

&amp;nbsp;

""What does that mean?""

&amp;nbsp;

""It means it's *not legal tender.*""

&amp;nbsp;

""Well it was the only thing I had in my car!""

&amp;nbsp;

Exit, stage left.

&amp;nbsp;

What makes this interaction stand out? Well, one of a few things:

· She did not know what the Confederacy was (I don't even know how this is possible, but for those of you who aren't aware, the Confederate States of America was the country formed during the American Civil War to fight the USA)

· She attempted to pay with currency for a country that hasn't existed for a hundred years

· Even if she had tried to use it a hundred years ago, she wouldn't have been able to, seeing as how we live in a Union state. So, it was never legal tender here. Ever.

· She either had a genuine Confederate coin, worth a ton of money (thousands for a ""restrike"", almost a million for a original printing), and attempted to use it as a fifty cent piece or

· She came into possession of a replica coin without knowing that it wasn't a real coin despite it being larger than most common coins in circulation and also having the name of a different country on it

&amp;nbsp;

Look, I'll take Canadian coinage, even a Euro or a Peso in a pinch, but how about we stick to currency from currently existing countries, m'kay?

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway that was the weirdest part of my day.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Note: Due to the condition of the coin it's highly unlikely it was legit. Either that or this lady is in possession of the best condition Confederate half dollar in existence and is one auction site visit away from being a multi-millionaire.

He looks over to me and why he got $100 back. I told him that’s what he asked for in cash back.

TBH, it went back and forth like that for a while, I purely think he confused himself or something. He ended up saying “never mind, it’s ok.” With a smile and walks off. Like, he asked for $100 back, so I gave him the $100. I even double counted, so it’s not like he stole anything.

The lady behind him when she came forward with a confused look, we both talked about it a little and agreed either A, he confused himself entirely or B, he was thinking he was PAYING $100 and getting what ever that would be minus what he was paying for, which would have been $70 something because he paid a bit over $20.

Either way, was a fairly confusing experience.
He was nice and didn’t make a fuss about it all, so thankfully he didn’t get on my hide about what ever we both confused each other about.",TalesFromRetail
t3_csgf1v,Customer ruins her chance to buy a product she wanted,"This story was a while back. I worked in a discount store and a lot of makeup there would get broken into and swatched. We have a policy that we can't sell makeup that has already been swatched (touched by customers) for obvious reasons. I was ringing and a customer (C) comes to my register,

C: I wanted to get this makeup but it is swatched already, can I get a discount on this? 

(Keep in mind that this was the last makeup of it's kind. We didn't have any more of it in stock other than the one she brought up)

I wasn't aware of the policy yet so I called over to ask my manager (M) about it. My manager looked at the makeup and came over to talk to the customer.

M: I don't believe this item is swatched, but if it were swatched I wouldn't be able to sell this to you at all because we can't sell swatched makeup. 

C: It is swatched, if you look at it you can see a finger print. Is there anyway I can get a discount on it?

Me: I do think I see it too it looks like a finger print

M: It may have been just a bump on the make up or something, but if it is a swatch I wont be able to sell it to you at all. I will have to mark it out. 

C: No look closely thats not a bump you can see the line from the finger print

This sort of exchange went back and forth for a while so I'll skip to the end.

M: Okay I believe you that its swatched. I will have to mark it out of stock now. 

C: Wait I want it can't I still buy it? I don't need a discount I can buy it at the marked price.

M: Sorry but like I said I can't sell makeup that's swatched so I'm going to have to mark this out. 

The customer was disappointed. I couldn't believe it. How did she not see this coming? She was given so many chances to say ""okay its not swatched, I'll buy it at the regular price."" Her desperate attempt to get a discount on already discounted makeup ruined her chances at being able to buy it at all.",TalesFromRetail
t3_cssju0,Well I didn't know there was a party either!,"I work in a flower shop that does deliveries. This happened a year ago. The customer's mom was turning 90-something and she lives in a retirement home. The customer called on a Thursday or Friday to place her order which would be delivered on Monday. No problem.

The retirement home is on the edge of town, not incredibly far but it is an outlying area. For a normal day, the delivery drivers have certain priorities: anything timed (like before 12pm), hospitals, businesses, and then residences. Usually they build a route based on what is closest and spread out from there, keeping priorities in mind. Deliveries can also take until 5-6pm on a busy day, and Monday happens to be our busiest day of the week.

Around 3-4pm on Monday, I get a call from the customer who wants to know where her delivery is. I check the driver's route and let her know that it is on our afternoon run, it's on the way and should be there in the next hour and a half.

The customer gets REALLY upset, asking why it wasn't delivered in the morning. Since I'm the one who took the order, I knew she didn't request a specific time for delivery, and I tell her that I'm sorry, but there wasn't a request for morning delivery on the order. She says that since she ordered days in advance, it should have been the first delivery that day. I politely explain that deliveries are not first-come, first-served and that our drivers build their delivery routes based on the above-mentioned priorities, plus outlying areas are usually not on our morning delivery route unless specified.

She tells me that there was a party at the retirement home for her mom at 2pm, there were family members there and since her flower arrangement hadn't been delivered, it looked like she didn't get her mom anything and she was embarrassed. I apologize and say I didn't know there was a party at 2 or we would have gotten it there sooner. She says *well I didn't know there was a party either.*

I did call the driver and ask them to re-route to make this one their next delivery. The arrangement got there, it was beautiful, but we ended up giving the customer a $25 credit which she used this year. When I pulled up her account and mentioned the credit, she said ""oh yea, I think that's because there was some trouble getting it to her last year.""

If you have specific expectations for something, please say so and don't assume we know what you want or can time-warp to know about parties you have no idea about.

TL;DR: customer expects us to read the future and deliver an arrangement in time for a party she didn't even know about.",TalesFromRetail
t3_csrob4,I can't help you lady...,"For background: Up until yesterday I worked for a home security company. You had a home security system and when it is triggered, we call you and ask if everything is ok and if we can't reach you we requested police/EMS/Fire dispatch. Depending on what services you subscribed to. 

The company I worked for suggested testing your system for all services you subscribed to on a monthly biases to make sure we were receiving alarm signals properly. And to call us to do the tests to make sure an emergency services wasn't sent to their home by mistake. 

My last week at this job I had a customer that called in to do a test with their system. Not an issue. I put a note in her account (all notes are presented to dispatchers when a signal comes in)to ignore the signals we get so no emergency services will be sent. 

Well, the only way to test a system is to  arm the security system and then trigger the alarm by opening a door, window, ect..

The conversation goes as follows - Me=Me, Customer=C

Me: So go ahead and put in your 4 digit code to arm the system. I am going to put a note in the account so the other dispatchers know we are testing.

C: I don't use my code to arm the system. 

Me: Okay well then just arm it how you normally arm it.

C: But I want to test it like me and my husband are asleep.

Me: Well then hold the stay button for 3 seconds. That will not arm the motion sensors so you can still walk around.

C: But I want the motion sensors on if we're asleep. 

Me: Okay then hold the away button for 3 seconds to activate the motion sensors. 

C: But we don't usually arm it with the motion sensors

Me: Just arm it how you normally would when going to sleep

C: But you told me to arm it this way. How am I supposed to arm it for a test?

Me: It doesn't matter how it's armed. We are testing to see if we get signals properly. You can arm your system however you're comfortable. 

C: Oh so it's the customers fault for not knowing how set the alarm. You're being very short with me.

Me: I'm just saying you can arm your system however you want. We aren't testing how it arms but how the signal comes in.

C: is there anyone who speaks my language that I can talk to? You obviously don't know what I'm talking about?

I didn't hear much about it after that.",TalesFromRetail
t3_csje77,Two 50% off stickers must mean it’s double reduced!,"Hi everyone! I work as a cashier for a large supermarket chain and this happened a few weeks ago. 

At the supermarket I work at it’s not uncommon for one or two cashiers to be in charge of coordinating the breaks for the other cashiers. Where I work we have 10 cashiers/lanes available on the weekend, a front end manager, and the breaks coordinator (myself). 

On the day of this story I must say that I was a little stressed, I was running a tad behind on the breaks and was completely exhausted from the night before. Anyways I decide to look at the scheduling sheet and decide to send the cashier running the express lane (1-12 items) for break. While I’m running the express lane a customer comes up to me with two 50% off stickers on a loaf of bread. The following conversation happened:

Me: Hi how are you? 

Rude Customer: It’s two 50% off!

Me: Sorry sir, unfortunately I can’t do that,  our store doesn’t allow two 50% discounts. I can only do 50% off. 

RC: No! It has two discount stickers so I get it twice reduced!

Me: Sorry sir unfortunately I can’t do that, like I said -

RC: No! 

He then proceeded to throw the bread off of the belt and walk away. I then looked at the cashier behind me  and was just like “what the fuck?”",TalesFromRetail

The cast are just me and the customer (C) for reference she looked around 70. 

Me: How are you today?
C: I’m fine... I just need to return this.
Me: Oh I’m sorry to hear that, was anything wrong with it?
C: *Starting to get upset and a few tears roll* No, I just bought it for my mom as a Christmas present, and she’s not going to make it.
Me: *Holding back any emotion because I just want to cry with her and hug her* I’m so sorry to hear that. You get to spend time with her now right?
C: Yeah we just had a spa day yesterday and we have been spending all the time we can together.
Me: That’s good to hear. *I give her the most genuine, reassuring, I feel your pain smile possible*

I did the return and sent her on her way with many words of encouragement. I never know what the people I interact with are going through. I just try to make everyone’s day better. I thought you all might enjoy hearing this. 

Note: The reason she returned it is that the item is a foot warmer and it’s in the upper 90’s.

This happened many years ago and I reconstruct it from my memory. While trying to be as accurate as possible I can’t guarantee it.

Story 1:

Woman tries to return a book. Unfortunately she doesn't has a receipt. When I try to look up the book I don't find it in our system. She gets angry, wanting to return it. I do further research, the book is out of print for more than 10 years, rather unlikely that she bought it from us. While she's boiling she tells me that she didn't bought it from us but another store but I shouldn't make such a scene and just return it for cash. Obviously had to deny it. She told me that she'll never buy stuff from us again. Since she never bought anything from us anyways I was just like  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Story 2:

Guy enters store:

Guy: ""I'd like to do a return""

Me: ""Sure, do you have a receipt?""

Guy: ""Oh, unfortunately not""

I sigh because people not having the receipt usually indicates that they either didn't care while buying and thus the item may is damaged or they try to rip you off.

Me: ""Ok, lets see what we can do""

Guy and me stare at each other for a while

Me: ""Can you show me the item you'd like to return? Would you prefer cash or store credit?""

Guy: ""Cash would be awesome!""

Me: ""Ok, what would you like to return? Can you hand it to me?""

Guy: ""Haha, no, that be difficult""

Me, slightly nervous: ""Haha ok, what would you like to return?""

Guy: ""My car, its just out there at the parking lot""

Guy and me stare at each other for a while. I just glance at our walls full of books, pencils and paper. Yep, I'm still in a bookstore, not in a garage. I also don't wear any clothes a mechanic would wear.

Me: ""Could you repeat please? I think I misunderstood you.""

Guy: ""I'd like to return my Honda Civic, it's just out there"" guy points at the parking lot in front of our store. (note: I don't remember the car anymore, just made one up.

Me: ""We're a bookstore""

Guy: ""So...no return?""

Me: ""No.""

Guy: ""ok""

t3_cs2up4,No tag no sale...BULLSH*T,"(Mobile) 


One big rule in our shop is if an item doesnt have a tag or it has been ripped or obviously tampered with we can not sell it. Some people cant seem to understand that rule and think they can get it for cheaper or claim it was this one price and just expect me to put that in. Quick thing, the shoes have the price written on them, clothes and some toys have paper tags and few other items have stickers. Now on with the show.

A mom, the grandma and two kids are shopping around and the kid sees this bag of toys she wants but her grandma says no and starts throwing a huge tantrum about and screaming and sometimes even trying to hit her. They where in my line to check out and with this girl still screaming I hear the grandma say 

""you took the tag off, now you cant even get it"" 

This made this girl scream even louder and calling her a liar. When they finally came up the girl just tossed the bag on the counter and covered in tears. I look and sure enough the paper tag was ripped off. So I tell her the same thing the grandma told her. 

""Sorry I cant sell it if the tag isnt on it."" 

We went ballistic, this four year old girl screaming and crying at the top of her lungs about how ""wants it!"" And ""gimmie it!"" And my most favorite ""you're ugly now gimmie it"" 

What was the mother doing through all of this? Browsing her phone and ignoring her. I just check out her items but not easily since the girl kept trying to yank things out of my hands. The other kid who was a much calmer kid gave me his bag of toys and I check his out and that makes her cry even louder. 

""Why does he get a toy!?!?! Why cant I have my toy?!!?""

t3_csecp7,Tale from a small town phone retailer,"So forgive any typos and formatting I'm a little bit tipsy and on mobile but I felt like posting here. 

I work at a budget phone retailer. I've been working there for around 6 months around this time. Another piece of context for this story is that the area is a small southern town, and this location is the only location close to the other small towns in the area. Meth is a huge problem in this area and the towns surrounding it, so I have gotten used to dealing with tweakers as they've come in. I'm always very respectful and don't treat any customer differently than any other, regardless of how they treat me, their financial situation, or how much they try to buy, considering I work off of commission.

It's about 15 minutes until I close up the store and I'm starting to get ready to take everything down. In comes MH. MH comes in with her two friends, obviously all of them tweaking hard when they come in, Obvious meth sores from them using the substance and such, fast talking, and the paranoia. MH comes up to me complaining that her phone from another budget phone retailer got ""hacked"" and she needed a new phone for free. I told her I would happily supply her with a new phone as long as it was okay for me to get her pin number and account number from her previous provider so I could get her that phone (Note: my company only offers free phones if you bring your number from a non ATT company). She got mad saying that she didn't want the same number so I informed her that if we went through that process she could get a new number for a 15 dollar fee after we got her the phone (still would have been around 30 dollars cheaper than if she didn't bring it over). She refused that and just said she'd get the new number on the cheapest plan available. 

I begin to do her order and everything, and she asked if she would be able to download apps and such. I told her she would be able to with a Google account (She was getting a bottom of the barrel Android phone). She said she didn't trust Google and she wanted her apps regardless. I inform her she could try to download the applications from non Google sources but that posed security risks. She eventually said she'd create a NEW Google account as long as I made it for her. I oblige to make it for her, and I even give her a new phone case and tempered glass screen protector to help her keep her phone protected at almost half the cost were supposed to sell it at (it hurt my commission a bit but a sale is a sale.) I make her new Google account, give her the new number and show her how to work the phone. She seems satisfied enough so I walk her to the door and wish her a good night. 

I finish closing up the store, set the alarm and everything and as I walk out, she comes up to me and says her phone has already been hacked. I explain to her that it's impossible that her phone has been hacked already, and I can already feel myself getting ready to go off on her. (It's around 45m to 1h after I was supposed to clock out.) She shows me a setting on her phone and I calmly explain to her that it's normal for that setting to be on the phone. She then shoes me the normal games and apps that come preinstalled on the phone and I tell her that it's stuff that comes preinstalled on the phone and she has a hard time believing it. I tell her to trust me that I've set up dozens of phones of her model and thats all normal. She tells me she'll be back if it gets hacked like her last phone. 

I'm sure she'll come back so I let my coworkers know about her. What she looks like, her name, her phone model, and her complaints. Cue a few days later, I'm about to close up shop again and MH comes back in again, saying she's been hacked. I ask her a few questions like ""have you put your card information or banking information on your phone."" Stuff like that, you know, things 'hackers' would actually care about stealing. She said ""no but they still were able to hack it. They bought a universal Google key from the dark web to hack my account"". At this point I'm rolling my eyes but I offer to disable every Google application on her phone and completely delete the google account I made for her. She's ecstatic about this and happily gives me her phone. I do everything to make sure her phone was only for talk and text. She sits in her car for a few minutes afterwards and comes back in the store telling me she's still getting hacked. I look over her phone again and tell her that no she isn't getting hacked she has no account info on the phone not any apps on the phone that would allow remote access on the phone. She looks at me in a disbelieving way and tells me that she doesn't believe me, but she'd trust me and give it another day and ""if I'm hacked again, I'm coming back for a flip phone.""

A few days later she comes back and returns her phone for a flip phone, saying ""I've definitely been hacked"". At this point I don't care anymore about making her happy so I let her return the phone and just the phone (the case and screen protector are non refundable). I let her know that this phone has no connection to Google and cannot be hacked by the ""Google dark web key"" that she explained earlier. She seems happy again and leaves with her flip phone. 

And that's the last I saw of her, though after my two days off I came back to work and my manager informed me that MH came back trying to return the flip phone saying it was hacked as well. I'm super glad I've never had to deal with her since.",TalesFromRetail

C: ""I bought this yesterday and I want to return it"" 

obviously he did not recognize me I took the box and opened it to see the same nasty faucet as the day before

Me: ""Sir as I told you yesterday we can not take this back you need to call the company for their warranty and I can not take back a box with a different item inside.""

CM: ""We have a print of the receipt here that says you did""

t3_csdosj,Customers yells at me for his mistake,"Hey guys, before i begin, i must say that this happened a few months ago, so the details may not be 100% clear . And sorry for the lay-out as im on mobile. Enjoy the story!

So, quick background story: I work in a gas station as a student ( not a full time employee, keep this in mind) , and the day was normal , a lot of elderly ladies getting their cars fueled up and a lot of younger women that were getting packages, until this guy pulled up, 1. : he literally drove the wrong way with his motorcycle ( against the traffic , idk how to say it in an other way) , and he drove about 30km/h, while it’s only allowed to drive 5 km/h . I just decided to ignore that as it was not that rare ,but when he came in I knew he was going to be annoying to deal with

So when he came in, he instantly demanded I put it on his company name ( so the invoice would be sent to the company,...) so I searched for the company name, but nothing popped up. 
This infuriated him for some reason and he started his rant, I’ll try to recreate it as best as I can, so here is the dialogue
me= yours truly and c= customer

Me: I’m sorry but that name is not in our system, is it possible that it’s maybe under another name?
C: NO! I came in here two weeks ago to get my name in the system and it’s still not in?what amateurs are you
Me: I’m sorry, usually the names are in the system within a week, and it is not our fault as we are not responsible for putting them in the system , the main company is ( we work for another company), we just send the information. 
C: Don’t try to lie to me! You guys are responsible for everything! Isn’t there anyone else around so I can talk to someone that can actually do their job , like the boss or something!
Me: nope it’s just me tonight , but if you want I can call the boss, just so he can confirm what I’m saying.
C: No that’s not necessary, I can’t believe you. I am a teacher and my students have respect for me, unlike YOU! I worked for -name of a company that I can’t remember the name of - and they are really well known now 
Me : (obv getting pissed by his insults) well I don’t know the company , is there another name or not ?
C: NO I TOLD YOU ( furiously rotating his hands in the air like an attack helicopter to show how mad he is )
Me: ok have a nice weekend ( followed by a 10 sec death stare ) 
C: euh OK give me the receipt BYE
Me: (waving as he drives away)
So I asked the boss , result: it was on another name, because the man wanted it on that specific name , and he probably forgot 
So he was practically screaming at a student for something he did, he is kinda banned from the shop now tho

t3_csbink,"Customer doesn't want a sweater on the mannequin because it's already been ""used"".","I got a short one from today:

So, I work at a store in the mall that allows customers to put things on hold until the end of the next day. We would take note of the person who is wanting to put the item (name, day, and what it was) and put it on hold for them. At the end of the day, we go through and put expired holds back out on the floor. Easy, right?

Well, today was Sunday and a woman (with about five family members in tow) came in to get some of her items on hold. I'm in the back cleaning and folding while I notice my co-workers dealing with her. I go up and ask what's going on and my co-worker tells me that we can't find her hold bag. From what I'm told from her, it's just a sweater. Me, looking for solutions, ask what it was and what size so we can find out what it is, give it to her, and put that one that's on hold out when we find it so we can keep the day going.

This woman got in my face about me trying to help. While she followed me to where the rest of the sweaters were, she refused to believe I could help her with this. 

Me: This is the sweater and also in a small. *holding up the one on the mannequin*

Customer, apparently pissed at me: I don't want that one.

Me: It's the same one as....

Customer: I don't want a used one.

Before I could ask what she means by that, my co-worker, thankfully, finds her hold bag from the back. It's then I realize she has a hold bag that is our largest bag filled with stuff (all of this stuff that we have plenty of that she didn't need to put on hold in the first place).

t3_cs87oc,My first official customer complaint!,"So we have a crazy sale going on right now, snow crab and local shrimp are both like half price, plus a bunch of meat items.  They do these weekend sales with like 6 crazy priced sales to get people in, and at least half the sales are seafood and meat.  Plus the closest grocery store to us has closed for a month for remodel.  So needless to say we were SLAMMED.

At the time there were 2 of us in seafood, and 4 in the meat room.  Both of us in seafood were actively waiting on customers when Karen comes to the area between the meat and seafood departments and says ""Do you have any more of these in the back?""  She is holding a pack of steaks.  I said ""Oh, m'aam, there is a buzzer right at your knee level, if you buzz it one of the butchers will be right out to help you"".  Omg, you would of thought I told her to fuck right off.  She says ""What, you can't SPEAK to me?  You can't HELP a customer?""  I just completely ignored her and turned to MY customer and said ""that was a pound, right?""  Bitch, you can clearly see that we are both actively waiting on people.

So she huffed and puffed and finally pretty much slammed the buzzer with her open palm.  All while muttering ""unbelievable"" and ""you can't even get help in here"".  Meanwhile there are literally so many customers in the vicinity of meat and seafood that you can barely fit carts...so it's not like we were standing there chewing gum and texting on our phones.  Butcher comes out, she asks her question, they help her, all done.  Ha!  just kidding.

I get red lined from the store manager five minutes later and he says ""Uh, did you just tell a customer to ring the meat buzzer?""  I said ""Uh, yes....coworker and I were each waiting on people and I politely told her to ring the MEAT buzzer for her MEAT question, even though she totally interrupted us waiting on our own customers.""  He said ""Oh.  Well....she said she thought it was very rude that you told her to ring the buzzer and wouldn't help her, and asked for me (store manager) to make a complaint on you.""

Bitch, who is the rude person here?  Who the fuck are you that you are more important than the people we are already waiting on?  And you are asking a meat question at the seafood counter to boot.  There's a giant sign ""RING BELL FOR BUTCHER"".  If it was not crazy busy and I didn't have a customer, I would have went back there and asked if we had any more steaks.  But really, you're going to complain to the store manager?  How delusional and self important are some of these people.",TalesFromRetail
