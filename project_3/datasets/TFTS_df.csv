So, something like 90% of the mod removals are posts that obviously don't belong here.

When we ask if they checked the rules first, almost everyone says, ""O sorry, I didn't read the sidebar.""

And when asked why they didn't read the sidebar, almost everyone says,  ""B-b-but I'm on mobile!""

So this sticky is for __you__, dear non-sidebar-reading mobile users.

t3_dj7kgc,Woman just doesn't understand how this works,"Bit of a lurker here, come from a friend group of IT workers including myself where we exchange the horrors we face in our respective workplaces. This was one of the few that stood out.

A woman came to him with the following issue: ""I am unable to hear the sound from the PowerPoint slides my manager sends me every month. Its not the computer because sounds from other websites come through just fine"". So following this he goes to check the PowerPoint where there are indeed mp4 files and they are working just fine. And she even agreed that they work fine. What turned out to be the issue was the woman expected hear the PP as if it were a live presentation and that something is going to read the PP to her. He was absolutely speechless.

One other small interaction with the same person went a little like this:

Friend: Go ahead and sign completely out and then sign back in.

Woman: All the way out?

Friend: No halfway out",talesfromtechsupport
t3_djd5xs,"We tried to help an old lady, she brought in her lawyer...","Older story. Been debating posting this for awhile.

A couple of years ago, I worked for a small computer store in the city, we also offered repair services, and we were pretty well known in the area. One of our regulars, an older lady in her 70s comes in one day complaining about not having video from her computer. It works perfect when we try, so she brings in her monitor. That's when we get no picture like she had described.

So, at this point, we know that the issue is not with the computer itself. So, we hook her monitor up to an old PowerMac, and it works like a charm. The problem is that the adapter she uses to hook her PC to the monitor has died.

This is where things start getting hairy.

See, the monitor this old lady is using is an old Apple Cinema Display that uses some old proprietary connector (literally called the Apple Display Connector). Her computer is a Windows PC. That's where the adapter comes in. It converts the proprietary connection to a useable standard like VGA. This isn't the Apple DisplayPort either, it's older than that.

Just replace the adapter and you're done, right?

Unfortunately for her (and us) the only company left that made these adapters was either forced out of the market, or sued. I think it was the latter, I don't really remember. Point is, these adapters no longer exist for a reasonable price.

When we tell her this, the lady *freaks out!* I'm talking putting banshees to shame. She's shouting things like *""You promised to fix it!""* And *""Dirty liars!""* Like, lady, we can't get you something that isn't produced anymore, and is getting scalped on eBay for $300+.

Lucky for me, I'm in the back working a different repair. It's my poor boss who has to deal with her.

At this point, my boss tries to compromise by swapping her old Apple display for a new standard PC one that has the same screen in it.

For some reason, giving her an almost *free* monitor (albeit trading for her old one) makes her even angrier?! The whole thing ends when she pulls the *""I'll be back with my lawyer!""* line and walks out the door without her computer.

Believe me, I wish this story ended here, but no such luck.

Next day, I'm working inventory (you can see the front desk from the inventory room) when this old lady walks in followed by this spiffy looking dude in a suit and tie. Takes me a minute to put two and two together and figure out that *she actually came back with her friggin lawyer!*

My boss is actually mad now. At first he calmly explains the issue, and that he tried to work a compromise that worked *heavily* in her favor. But then a shouting match ensues after a comment that I couldn't hear.

Now I feel bad for her lawyer who looks like he already smells her bullshit, and is trying to wedge himself into an argument between a little old lady, and my boss who is a full head taller than him, and looks like death when he's mad.

What I do hear is the old lady saying *""I'm not threatening your business or anything.""* To which my boss responds *""You are the definition of a threat to business when you walk into an establishment with your lawyer!""*

A moment of silence...then *""Get out of my store.""* Fortunately, that was the last we heard of her. She and the lawyer walked out the door without another word (actually, the lawyer walked, that old lady stomped out).

She got to keep her useless monitor, but she never did pick up her computer. Because of our policy that is taped to the front desk, in several places, in plain view, and in a document with her signature, her computer became part of our stock because she didn't take it back within the 60 day period.

TL;DR Old lady freaks out about an adapter for an Apple monitor, we try to compromise in her favor. She blows up and brings in her lawyer.

EDIT: thanks to u/clausenfoto for the identifying the display connector. Fixed in the post",talesfromtechsupport
t3_djeew5,Encyclopædia Moronica: T is for Three Little Words,"Two years ago:

&gt; ME: Ma'am, I understand your reluctance to shut down in the middle of the day, but we need to install the updated controller or else your controller will no longer be compatible with the new software.

&gt; Site Manager (SM): No! You come back tonight, and do it after hours!

&gt; ME: That's fine, we can arrange a time to do it after hours. However, I'll need to get sign off from the project manager for the over time.

---

One month later:

&gt; Project Manager (PM): I've submitted an updated quote to SM with the new rate for after hours work, but she is refusing to sign off on it.

&gt; ME: Let me know when she does - I've got no issue with doing the work, but we've got to get paid for it, right?

&gt; PM: Exactly.

---
---

One year ago:

&gt; ME: Okay ma'am, I've finished measuring up for the new screen to go in - I'll pass these to PM and he'll send you a quote. Once you've signed off on the quote, I can come back and install it for you.

&gt; SM: Good! Better not be too expensive.

&gt; ME: I've got no say in the rates that PM bills us out for; that's completely out of my control.  
Speaking of PM, I don't recall ever installing that updated controller. Did PM ever get that quote to you?

&gt; SM: No! Too expensive! You, you leave now!

&gt; ME: ... As you wish. May the rest of your day be as pleasant as you are.

---

Three weeks ago:

&gt; PM: Gambatte...

&gt; ME: I dislike this conversation already - you only say my name like that when you want me to do something I don't want to do. What's up?

&gt; PM: You remember SM?

&gt; ME: Remember her? Let's see... Short, middle-aged Indian or Pakistani woman, heavy accent, aggressive attitude? Barred *{a co-worker}* from her site for reporting unsafe work practices, impugned the work ethics of myself and *{my co-worker}*, got her site put on permanent stop credit with *{sister company}*, got herself blacklisted by *{major company we work with regularly}*, and is permanently at war with her neighbour over who owns what parts of the shared concrete parking lot outside their respective front doors, resulting in arguments if not outright fistfights whenever she wants us to install something outside - and she once called me out at 6 A.M. as ""CRITICAL SITE DOWN"" because they'd overloaded the single wall socket in the main office that they run *{all of the critical equipment}* from on daisy-chained power strips¹ - then tried to cancel the call when I was already in the parking lot so she wouldn't get billed for it!

---

¹ Tripped breakers are absolutely outside our area of responsibility, and thus the call was chargeable at entirely unreasonable after hours rates.  

---

&gt; ME: So yes, yes, I think you could say that I remember her!

&gt; PM: Ah. Well... She needs help.

&gt; ME: Excuse me one second.

*(incapacitated due to Hideous Laughter)*

&gt; ME: I'm back. What's going on?

&gt; PM: She ordered some new equipment.

&gt; ME: Didn't we already cover the ""stop credit"" thing?

&gt; PM: Yeah. So she ordered them from someone else, and got them to install it.

&gt; ME: Okay, I'm with you so far.

&gt; PM: But the new equipment uses a different protocol, so she needs a new protocol converter installed in her controller. But-

&gt; ME: Don't tell me - the new converter isn't compatible with her old controller and now she URGENTLY needs the upgrade she's been stonewalling for the last two years?

&gt; PM: Pretty much.

&gt; ME: Excuse me.

*(Hideous Laughter returns)*

&gt; ME: Okay, I'm back, I'm back.

&gt; PM: The catch is that SM wants the old equipment to run alongside the new stuff.

&gt; ME: Right, so we need to install the new converter, in parallel with the old one, in the new controller.

&gt; PM: Pretty much.

&gt; ME: That's not hard. All going to plan, it'll take me five minutes to do the hardware side of things, but you'll need to check with the Implementation Team on how long the software will take. If it was just a straight swap, I'd say half an hour, but setting up the new equipment on the new protocol might take longer, so best to ask them directly.

&gt; PM: I'll give them a call now - talk to you later!

And so the call ended. I set about locating the appropriate converter board and the new controller; while the controller was in stock, the converter board was a rarer beast, so I had to get one shipped in.  
The following day, all parts in hand, I headed out to the site to once more do battle with the dragon lady that is SM.

I composed a short speech in my head:

&gt; **T**hank you for agreeing to meet today.  
&gt; **O**bsolete equipment, such as you have installed, will not work with your new systems.  
&gt; **L**uckily, I have been able to procure updated equipment at short notice.  
&gt; **D**on't worry, it is under control!  
&gt; **Y**esterday, I was informed of your issues by PM.  
&gt; **O**btaining these parts immediately became my highest priority.  
&gt; **U**ntil they are installed, none of the new systems will work.  
&gt; **S**hortly, I will shutdown the whole site for a few minutes to replace the controller.  
&gt; **O**nce the new controller is configured, and connected, the new systems should be able to communicate correctly.

Yeah, that'll work...

---
---

Unfortunately, the Implementation Team let me down - the first one (I1) was great, but some work was left for a second tech to do overnight (I2). I2, however, misinterpreted the instructions, and called me back to site after hours to try to determine why some of the new equipment wasn't working (hint: it was neither connected, nor powered on). I1 did eventually get involved again, despite the late hour, and a semblance of sanity returned.  
I did return to the site in the following days, as the new systems continued to fail to communicate with the new controller. Unfortunately, it seemed that the only person with the desire to see this fixed was me, despite it falling entirely outside the realm of my responsibility... I eventually determined that the third party installers had incorrectly configured the new systems. On the plus side, I did learn a bit about the systems that they installed there, so it wasn't a total loss - and I'm certain that PM ensured that my learning experience was billed to SM at an extremely unreasonable rate. Whether SM was able to recover that cost from the third party installers who incorrectly configured the system is a question which I have no desire to learn the answer to.

**TL/DR:** If tech support says you need an upgrade or new stuff won't work, don't be surprised when new stuff doesn't work after you refuse the upgrade.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_dje1yj,"Load Probably Bad Data Into a Mission Critical Database? No, thanks!","This is an old one, like me.  And it's probably WAY too long.  It might need cutting in parts.  I do tend to be long-winded.

Back when I was a mainframe programmer, in the 1980s -- yes, IBM mainframe using COBOL (gasp!) -- I worked for a state law enforcement agency and was the primary developer (actually, the only one, since the only other guy had retired) for a system that state police, sheriff's deputies and police officers used in order to give officers real-time access to wanted and missing persons, as well as stolen cars and other kinds of stolen articles.  The way this used to work was that the officer would radio in the relevant data, and get a verbal response from dispatch.  These days it is done using a mobile terminal in the officer's cars, but my story took place back in the dark ages.

Anyway, the wanted and missing persons part was particularly important because of officer safety -- a police officer seriously needed to know if the vehicle he had just pulled over was stolen or had been reported as involved in a crime, or if the person he was briefly detaining in a traffic stop was wanted for some crime, or had been reported as a missing person.  Our system provided this quite well, but the one thing it didn't provide was if the person that had been pulled over was currently under supervision (i.e. on parole) from the state prison system.  Someone came up with a way to provide this information by getting a monthly extract from the prison system, so we could load it into our database, and if a match occurred in a query, a response would be generated automatically.  And the officer would be warned to be careful with the subject.

Easy, right?  I wish.

The easy part was coding what our system would do in the event of a ""hit"", or identity matches.  I had that developed and tested using test data (that I created) in just a couple of weeks.  It seemed to work quite well, so the next step was to get ""live"" data from the prison system, and load that into our database.  The data was to be extracted on their end, copied to a data tape, and sent to us via internal mail.  

The problem was, we had to have the data extract be in a format that our system could use.  So, we specified what we needed and in what format the information needed to be in.  Names needed to be last name followed by a comma, then first name and middle names or initials, if any; dates of birth needed to be real dates (e.g. no February 29th except in leap years); either male or female (this was back in the days before ""non-binary"" was considered a sex); height in inches; accepted hair color codes; and a number of other things that were actually national standards.  

I got the first extract, had our operators copy it out to a file I could use to load the database.  And then I tried to upload it.  Immediately the data loader program crashes.  ""What the heck?"" I wondered.  The exception code indicated that the program had tried to load the wrong kind of data into a database field that couldn't accept it.  So, I had a look at the data to see what the problem was.  Oh my gosh, it was all over the place!  Numerics where text strings were supposed to be, text strings where numerics were needed (like ""5 foot 8 inches"" instead of ""68"") bad codes (like ""dark"" for hair color when it needed to specify an actual hair color), impossible dates (it didn't seem likely that we'd have to look out for people born in 1860), and a number of other things.  We had clearly told them what we needed, and it looked like they had just gone through their database and grabbed whatever was there and splatted it out to us.  I couldn't believe that their database contained such incredible garbage!  

So I wrote up every problem I found and sent them a detailed description of the problems, and asked for corrections.  

A week later I get a corrected tape, and of course some of the problems were fixed, but not all.  And I also found other previously unnoticed problems.  More emails.  Eventually, after a few weeks, I got data that would actually load into the database without exceptions.  And now we could have our beta testers run queries to see how the system worked.  Now, it is perfectly normal for a new system to need changes to make it work right.  And it is also normal to have to go through this two, three, four or more times. This is expected, and allowed for.  Some of the initial changes the testers requested were my responsibility, but some were the prison system's.  And so it went.

But every single time I got a tape with new database changes, it was almost like when we started out.  Fixed problems were unfixed; completely new data fields were totally wrong; and this occurred Every. Single. Time.  I had to spend a few days going back and forth with them until they finally got everything fixed again.  We went through this ridiculous cycle about six times until it looked like we could get a final tape from the prison system's production database, and we could move our new feature into production on our end.  Hooray!

On the morning of the day we were expecting to go live, I showed up at my usual starting time.  The new tape was in, and I was about to instruct our operators to load it into our test system when my boss (Boss) called me in for a conference with the database administrator (DBA).  What could they possibly want?  And it was here that I got blind-sided.  They both looked grim, like someone was about to get a reaming.  It was just my boss talking, the DBA was there just for emphasis, I guess.

Boss: \[grim reaper\] ""Why are you here so late?""

Me: \[puzzled\] ""This is when I always come in.""

Boss: ""The new subsystem is supposed to go live this morning!  We expected you to come in early!""

Me: ""You didn't say anything about coming in early.""

Boss: ""It should have been understood!  It's supposed to be live NOW!""

Me: ""Like I said, that wasn't communicated to me.  Nobody said anything about 'first thing in the morning'.  I understood it was going live *today*, not *6 am today*.""

Boss: ""Regardless, why weren't you here early?""

Me: ""Aside from not being told to come in early, you mean?  OK, you've you been following the progress of the development effort, right?"" He nods at this.  ""So, how many times have I had to send their data tapes back because they couldn't seem to get the data right, every time there was a change?""

Boss: \[looking cautious\] ""Quite a few.""

Me: ""That's right.  And I can guaran-damn-tee you, it's going to be screwed up today, too.  Why should I come in early today to load data that is going to fail basic edits, just so I can send them a bug report and then wait until tomorrow or the next day to get it fixed?  When odds are, it will fail the edits the next time, too?""

Boss: ""But this will be production data!""

Me: ""Yes, but can you guarantee me that their production system data will not contain new data problems that their test system code hasn't be designed to filter out?""

Boss: \[defeated\] ""No, I can't.""

Me: ""Then let me out of here so I can load the new tape and see if it's clean.""  

Rather deflated, but still trying to look stern and in charge, they let me go. 

Production data, of course, is supposed to be clean data. But the prison system didn't have the same standards we had, because they had a completely different emphasis.  After what I had seen, I wasn't going to trust their data. Not one bit, until I could test it.

Of course, the data on the new tape blew up.  And it took two or three days before I got a tape that got a clean upload, and another few days before some brand-new data problems caused by the prison system's production data could get ironed out.  So the roll out of the new subsystem was a week and a half late, but at least it got rolled out.

A side benefit of all this was that my boss stopped being so much of a control addict with me, and the DBA was quite impressed with my wizardry.  We actually became quite good friends.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_djct9t,"Brought my coffee machine to work, boss thinks it's broken","As with everyone in the boomer generation, if it's new and fancy, it's a computer, or it has a computer, and as soon as you mention programming it, it's a computer.

So I upgraded my Nespresso machine at home to the new fandangled dome pod thing (I, as in, my wife) so I thought ""You know what, I'll stick the old one in the break room at work""

I made sure to put instructions up with it that I'd reprogrammed the ""Espresso shot"" button to a Mug size, and the Mug button to travel mug size (about 500ml)

Within 24 hours I copped terrified questions from the boss thinking he'd broken it, the two best ones were:

First time he yelled:

""It won't stop! It's everywhere! How do I make it stop?!"" He'd put one of the smallest coffee cups I'd ever seen under it and proceeded to push the mug button.

When I stopped it (just push the button again) he was bemused ""My one at home doesn't do that much"", I just pointed to the instructions that it's been reprogrammed, and that he just needs to push the button to stop it where he wants it.

The second time ""It's not working!"", I walk up and plug it in. It shares a PowerPoint with 2 microwaves, the plug was looped over the top of the coffee machine itself.

For more laughs, he then tried using the Nespresso app to control it, so he'd finished his coffee, gone back to his desk, leaving a pod in it and his mug under it.

Apparently his daughter has one that can be programmed to wake you up with a coffee, or she can leave a pod in it and trigger it with her phone.

I said this one can't do that, but was told ""Well it should be able to,it has a computer in it,if you can reprogram it, it's a computer, and computers can talk to each other""

The 40 other people here, including another Boomer know how it works and have zero issues understanding a coffee machine.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_dj8lva,My head isn't the only thing spinning,"Several months ago, I had a call from a user that worked from home in another state over from me. A big storm was hitting both my state and the user's state at the same time. Our call went something like this after we greeted each other:

ME: So what's going on?

USER: I'm trying to connect to VPN so I can get some work done from home.

ME: Okay, are you receiving an error message?

USER: Yea, it says connection failed. 

ME: Okay, are you able to connect to the Internet at all?

USER: Oh, let me check and see if I can connect to Google.

She browsed to Google but it took about a minute to finally pull up.

USER: I was able to get to Google but it took a long time.

ME: Okay, so perhaps your Internet connection is slow? Are you on wifi?

USER: Yes

ME: Are you far away from the wireless router?

USER: Kind of? I'm in a closet right now.

ME:....why are you in a closet?

USER: Oh, we had a tornado siren go off a while ago. I did get a tornado warning text message that a tornado touched down north of here.

I paused for about several seconds after she said this.

ME: ....so you're trying to work during the middle of a storm with a tornado nearby?

USER: Yea, but now that you say that, that's probably why I'm having issues, huh?

ME: I would say so, yes. You may want to wait until the storm and tornado pass and try again then. It's likely causing issues with the Internet in your area. Definitely stay safe.

USER: I will. It seems to have calm down a bit but I will try VPN again later. Thanks!

t3_dj8yuc,I guess we're elevator repair guys now.,"Here's a tale from the beginning of my IT career as a networking tech.

I worked at a wireless engineering company that designed rf environments and took care of a local furniture chain when work was slow.

 One day we got a really peculiar call from their corporate office. The elevator at the closest store was beeping and the end users complained till they sent us out because the elevator guy hadn't come yet.

I go there with the engineer I was working with that day a quick look at it. There's no ethernet wires that connect to the elevator, and it has nothing to do with the wifi so it by every definition is not our problem and far out of our skillset. (Pots line in elevator was responsibility of elevator guy)

We go back to the front desk in the store and tell them that this is not something we fix. The ladies look at us puzzled.
Front desk ladies:
 ""Well there must be something you can do right?"" 
Engineer:
""N-no, we have no idea as to an elevator, we are in charge of the wifi. Call the elevator guys.""
Lady:
""But it's beeping, can't you fix it?""
Engineer:
""No, we dont touch elevators.""
Lady:
""But it's the phone line in the elevator. I've seen you run cables like it.""
Engineer:
""No, we can't fix that. We aren't certified to work on elevators.""

t3_dj7fyq,"I'll Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission","Oh boy this one. 

So I work as a system admin on the program management team (yep) of a midsized company. They just recently launched this team so theres all the fun of writing processes and establishing team structure with that. 

I was quickly deemed the tech guy of the group, possibly because I have an IT role and exist on a project management team, and was tasked with building out Powerapps for the group to use. Intended use was to connect an intake form with SharePoint to track project documentation. Easy peasy.

So I started scoping out the project and navigating our offshore IT department for access without turning too many heads to our team since IT roles dont belong in program management and some VPs may not like that. 

Come to find out our current architecture uses an onprem copy of sharepoint. The dialogue with my boss follows:

$Boss: How's the project coming?

$Me: I dont think we can do it internally. The SharePoint site is an onprem copy which requires a gateway to setup a connection.

$Boss: Why can't we do that?

$Me: it'll turn heads our way if we start trying to establish all time access gateways on our team. 

$Boss: But the AVP of x (her work husband) is doing it for other teams.

$Me: He may have one already established. I'll check with him. 


So I go to the AVP and ask him how he setup the gateway. He described how to connect to SharePoint which sounded suspiciously like connecting to the online copy of sharepoint instead of onprem. I pried a bit but found he was mostly clueless to what i was talking about. Not technically, just didn't get why I was asking about onprem stuff. 

My boss conveniently waltzes into this meeting which I did not invite her to but whatever she's my boss. They mention the site was recently updated so maybe the onprem is an old copy and the online is the current copy. Makes sense. 

I go to our offshore IT and ask them to provide a url to the current SharePoint site. He (sr system admin) sends me the onprem copy. I clarify that the online link i have is not current and am given a firm and solid direction to NOT use the online copy. Got it.

Back to the boss and i deliver the news 

$Me: IT instructed us to use the onprem site.

$Boss: Who said that?

$Me: The senior admin on our team. 

$Boss: Who's that?

$Me: I don't know but I can send you the email.

$Boss: Do that. (Visibly frustrated)

I send the email and a few days later get back ""the AVP and I are going to look into setting this up. I don't understand why this is working for other teams and not us. We'll kick it back to you once we have it set up. Your priority is with x system anyways. ""

Okay. Fuck you lady. I responded with ""understood. Just make sure not to use -siteurl-""


About a week passes and in my 1:1 I get the conversation pointed at this project. 

$Me: did you get the connection to onprem established?

$Boss: Yeah you just had to -explains what the AVP said...not good-

$Me: Doesn't that point to the online site?

$Boss: I don't think so. It worked. 

$Me: can you show me? (Fake teach me voice here)

$Boss shows me the connection which points to the online site i explicitly informed her to not use. 

$Me: that's the online site we were explicitly told not to use. 

$Boss: Yeah but were building things for other teams this way. It'll be fine.

$Me: not to be out of line, but are you sure that's a good idea?

$Boss: Well if someone yells at you just say it's my fault. I'll ask for Forgiveness, not permission. If they fire me for this... -laughs like it won't happen-

$Me: Okay if you say so.

t3_djd96y,Who reads status messages?,"Not a specific story but rather the general experiences I have had at both places I worked at.

At my last job, we used instant messengers as another method of communication with coworkers. Many users would like to use instant messaging instead of using email or phone calls.

One day at my last workplace, I noticed we could edit our status messages in Lync. After a bit of thought, I decided to change it to ""When in doubt, reboot!"". It would show up next to my name in the contact list of the instant messenger.

Within a week, I have had a few users that I run into the hallways and kitchens mention to me that they were about to message or call me but then saw my status message and it reminded them to reboot their PCs before calling Help Desk and it fixed their issues. As time went on, more people have mentioned the same thing.

I did this at my new workplace and the same thing happened. I have also noticed I have had less calls, tickets, and emails for minor issues.

The summers usually demand more physical labor, because that is when all the faculty and students are gone. We seize this opportunity to rearrange server racks, move equipment in and out of rooms, etc.


Part of the annual summer routine is to update the inventory, which involves travelling to each classroom and office and document most devices with an IP address. Since I'm the college student, I'm usually sent off to do this task along with a co-worker my age who is in the same position I am.


Occasionally, there will be some teachers or coaches that hang around because of summer sports, classes, or what have you. One particular incident occurred when we went to the main lobby / office space for all of the coaches. My co-worker (let's call him Alan) and I had documented everything in that area sans the access point. We did that last because it required getting to the ceiling.


Nobody else was in the area except for the volleyball coach. She'll be VC.

&gt; Me: Hi, VC. Do you mind if we temporarily kick you off wireless for a minute or two?


&gt; VC: Sure, no problem; let me just finish backing up some files.


At this point, Alan and I waited 5-10 minutes for her to finish backing up her files to the cloud, until:


&gt; VC: Quick question: do I need to be on the internet to put files on a second hard drive?


I look at Alan and he looks at me. No expressions or words were exchanged, but we both knew exactly what the other was thinking.


&gt; Alan looked back at her: No, VC, that can be done offline.

t3_diw82w,Self solving user issues,"For a while I did some end user support in a small company. Periodically, I would get users calling me or contacting me on Skype about the printer not printing, or some system not doing what it should do, but normally always did.

This being a small company, and me trying to provide a good service, I usually dropped everything, and walked over there, trying to help that poor user in distress. 

Here is, where it becomes interesting: More often than not, I get to the user and ask him to reproduce the issue. In more cases than I can write off as a statistical anomaly, the problem no longer occurred... The users were flabbergasted, as they swore to me it just didn't work. Repeatedly. Naturally, the next question then was: What did you do? Me? I did nothing - which is the truth. But they never believed me. 

Once I got the hang of it, I played along: What did you do? My answer: Do you see these hands (while wiggling them in front of their faces)... MAGIC!!! Then I turned around and walked away. After this happened repeatedly, users grew weary of calling me. And the more they expected me to do the magic trick again, the more often it happened :-). 

Law of attraction.

When that became old, I changed my strategy a little: A user contacts me, and I proceed to ignore him/her for say, 30-45min. More often than not, the problem had gone away by then, even without me showing my magic hands.

t3_dirash,His sound card died.,"Another post reminded me of the time I was able to earn over 2k/hr from a service call.

I was working in an independent shop at the time that was fairly generous with free diagnostics if you brought the PC in, especially with return customers. 

One thing we were never flexible with was onsite service. Our rate at the time was 85/hr with a 2 hr minimum. No exceptions, a tech wouldn't even be scheduled until the minimum was paid upfront. 

A regular came in and said his sound stopped working. He didn't want to disconnect his tower and bring it in so I ran through a few things with him to check himself before we setup a service call.

A couple of hours later he called and said he didn't get anywhere and would like us to send out a tech. I was available later that day so I scheduled it and ran his card.

When I showed up I looked through windows briefly for anything obvious. Nothing is muted, device manager reports that everything is good, speakers are plugged into the correct jack and have power.

I went to YouTube and started a video. After cranking up the volume I heard some noise coming from under the desk.

Laying down in front of the tower I see a pair of headphones that are plugged into the front headphone jack. I reached down to unplug them and the speakers start blaring Led Zeppelin. 

I was a little embarrassed for the guy as he just paid 170 for me to unplug his headphones. I spent about an hour tutoring him before I left so he'd get a little more for his money.",talesfromtechsupport

tl;dr- I'm at a client site playing the spare wheel at someone else's project summation/readout meeting. Ian seems to be involved somehow. Ian (a very special colleague) is also found a new way to be memorable and is currently standing behind me at the hotel bar.  
  
me:""Ian?""  
  
Ian:""What?""  
  
me:""What are you doing here?""  
  
Ian:""I'm sarging. What are you doing?""  
  
me:""Drinking, I guess""  
  
I make a mental note to do some googling later.  
  
Ian:""Well, good luck with that""  
  
Ian's oddly dressed friend motions for him to walk on and they move on to someone else.  
  
Woman:""Friends of yours?""  
  
me:""I know the one from a past job.""  
  
Woman:""Colleagues?""  
  
me:""More like a cold that lingers on for so long you half get used to it and give it a name and origin story""  
  
She laughs and we have a meandering conversation while Recruiter and John finish up. I wander over to and we work out what each of us are doing. John will be presenting his findings and recommendations and I'll add ""color"" to them.  
  
We then use our remaining time to have a few more drinks on Client's expense.  
  
The next morning I regret that decision. The shower/suit/caffeine routine doesn't put a serious dent in my hangover. Recruiter and John are in somewhat better shape and we make our way to the Client offices.   
  
Clients' offices were the height of fashion, if Bennigan's in 1994 was fine dining. Lots of glossy wood, gold-tone recessed lighting and card table green paint.   
  
We make our way to a conference room that feels as luxurious as my high-school homeroom. I wait for a few minutes reviewing my notes while nursing a cup of coffee. Over the next ten minutes, a handful of people walk in:  
  
Russell: A back-slappy silver fox of a salesman. He's all smiles, but most of the other Client people seem to respect/fear him.  
  
Lynne: Client's director of IT. She's usually half focused on a tablet in front of her, as if the pot would boil but for her watching.  
  
Samantha:A younger woman who seems to take notes about everything. I think she's some kind of project manager.  
  
They're waiting for other people, but Samantha forces the proceedings to start close to time. John starts by diving into very specific technical detail, which I'll give you the exec summary:  
  
* Client's customers have legacy or obsolete systems that perform complex core business tasks, like payroll, medical billing or inventory management. These systems are expensive to change, update or move away from. 
  
* Client's customers operate in regulated markets so they have to do a lot of reporting, which changes on a regular basis. 
  
* Client has found an interesting niche. They take their customers' data, generate compliant reporting and spit it back to the customers for a profit.   
  
* Client is mining the tech debt of quite a few organizations who can't just rip out their old systems. Client isn't going to grow explosively, but they have a captive market.  
  
* Client's customers do occasionally remember that Client has a _lot_ of their sensitive data and puts their operations at risk should Client's systems go down.   
  
* Each Customer site has a Client supplied endpoint exposed to the Internet on one end with deep hooks into Customer legacy systems.  
  
I now return us to a painful readout. 
  
John:""We found over six of the endpoints that had older versions of your API""  
  
I'm searching through the report to see where he's at. He's decided to start in an appendix, not the executive summary.  
  
Russell is going from looking puzzled to annoyed.  
  
me:""Well, What John is saying is that we need to implement regular automated patching for all the endpoints""  
  
Lynne (looks up from her tablets):""We need to keep those endpoints compatible with our customers. We have to patch them by hand""  
  
  
John:""But you're at least twelve months behind on patching""  
  
Lynne:""we had different priorities""  
  
I hear a rustling and we have a new participant. Ian. He's better dressed than last night, but he's still Ian.  
  
Ian:""So, what are we talking about?""  
  
Russell smiles and introduces Ian to us as Client's new security engineer.   
  
We go back to our discussion.  
  
me:""We're confusing two things. The systems that support the customer facing APIs aren't patched. I get the APIs have to support the customer's output but how does upgrading the OS break the customer experience?""  
  
Lynne:""We've had some...""  
  
Ian(yelling):""It doesn't matter. The APIs themselves are secure. We tested them!""   
  
John:""The systems themselves are problematic. We kept locking up the test system with our scans""  
  
Ian(still yelling):""That doesn't mean anything. Who cares if an endpoint locks up!?""  
  
me:""Well, if it happens during a batch run, it might break an overnight process. That might result in unhappy customers""  
  
Ian(even more yelling):""But your testing broke the test system. You didn't test the production endpoints!!!""  
  
John (pointing at his laptop):""For good reason. You want us to test one and see if it falls over?""  
  
Lynne and Russell both shout ""NO!"" loud enough to make everyone but Ian jump. Ian rambles on about  for a minute until Russell shakes his shoulder.   
  
I see Russell and Lynne do that Leonidas and Gorgo head-nod thing. Lynne puts her tablet down and asks for a five minute break. Russell asks John and I if we want coffee.  
  
We wander out, leaving Ian with Samantha.  
  
Russell engages us with small talk about fishing and $local_sports_team as we walk to a kitchenette with a coffee maker that looks like it was liberated from a diner and the diner put up a fight.  
  
I'm trying to gently nudge past Lynne and Russell to get another cup of coffee in the futile hope that it'll get rid of my headache. Hangover + Ian is not the winning combination this morning.  
  
Lynne:""So, how do you think it's going?""  
  
John:""Well, you have a lot of work to do""  
  
Russell:""Can we make our customers happy by the end of the quarter?""  
  
Lynne:""We need more help""  
  
Russell:""We got you Ian""  
  
me:""I think Ian's a tool for a different kind of job. Lynne needs to reprioritize or bring in some IT help to clear the backlog on testing and patching. A contractor to do some of the other tasks will help""  
  
Russell:""I see. I think we have to do some internal discussion. Thank you for your report""  
  
Recruiter, John and I make our way back to the conference room. Ian is talking at Samantha.  
  
Ian:""Actually, I'm very intelligent. I have to hold back with most women""  
  
me:""Hey, Samantha. Looks like we're done here. Feel free to email with any questions. Ian, see you around""  
  
I get my bag and walk out to the parking lot. Recruiter is going to stick around and talk staffing things with Lynne for a minute, so John and I take a quiet Uber ride back to the hotel.   
  
As we get in the hotel elevator, John turns to me:  
  
John:""What's with that Ian guy?""  
  
me:""He doesn't have issues. He has the whole subscription""  
  
I take a nap for a few hours, then walk about the hotel for a distraction. I notice a few oddly dressed young men, similar to Ian and his friend from the night before. I follow them to a conference room, where it seems someone is setting up a seminar. I spend a minute looking at an easel describing the 'neurolinguistic seduction workshop' or something similar.  
  
One oddly dressed man sizes me up and saunters over with a grin.   
  
ODM:""Heyyyyyyyy. Are you interested in the seminar? You'll have to get some cooler threads if you want to channel all this power""  
  
ODM points at himself with his thumbs.  
  
me:""What do you charge for all this?""  
  
ODM smiles wider.   
  
ODM:""That's a question an Average Frustrated Chump would ask. What you should ask is if you're willing to change""  
  
me:""Good luck, man. I love your con""  
  
I flew home that evening with Recruiter and John. Recruiter told me that Client liked me enough to offer me a job, if I was willing to move. John got some sweet after-work and Ian was freed to take more pickup artist training.",talesfromtechsupport

This incident made me realise just how ignorant and naive people can be when it comes to computery stuff, and you should never assume that they have even the flimsiest grasp of the basics.

This happened in the early 1990s when PCs were hulking great lumps on or under your desk, monitors were heavy CRTs, you had to clean the fluff from your mouse's ball every few weeks, internet was dialup, Photoshop came on 12 3.5 inch floppy disks, and Windows NT was the latest thing.

My Dad is the guilty party. Even today the PC is a confusing jumble of things to him - every icon on his desktop is a 'file', even if it's a folder, or a drive or whatever. He can't get his head around the fact that there are different passwords for his internet connection, for Google, for his email, etc - that's all just 'the internet'. And 30 years ago he was even less clued up than he is today. I should point out that my Dad isn't thick, he was at senior board level in a well-known large company before taking early retirement. But technology isn't his strong point. Only last month I had to stop him buying a Chromebook because no, it's not a phone.

The story:

My (landline) phone rings.

Dad: Help! my programs don't work!

Me: Which ones?

Dad: All of them - none of them!

Me: OK, tell me what you're doing.

Dad: I just click on the file thingy as usual but nothing happens.

Me: Well, whatever you think you're doing is not what you're actually doing. We'll sort this out when you get back.

Dad: But I need to be able to \[do something\].

Me: Doesn't \[sister\] have a PC you could use?

Dad: I am using hers, but it won't let me launch my programs.

Me (baffled): I have no idea what you're on about, give me a ring when you get back.

&amp;#x200B;

Which he does.

Dad: All sorted, they all work now.

Me: OK, but I'll come round at the weekend to see what the problem was.

&amp;#x200B;

I got him to take me through his workflow, from turning the PC on to launching a program.

After booting up the PC successfully, he inserted a floppy disk, which popped open a window showing its contents - a single Word file named something like 'My Stuff'. He then opened the Word file, which consisted of a single page which had shortcuts to programs, documents etc. strewn across it. And of course when he double clicked on one of these it opened the document or launched the program. So in his mind those little icon thingies *were* the programs and documents.

I got him to confirm that this was how he operated all the time, then tried to explain what shortcuts were, why they worked OK on his PC but not hundreds of miles away on someone else's. He really struggled to understand why taking the floppy on holiday and expecting this to either contain everything on his PC, or create a magic gateway to his PC at home, which was turned off, would never work. I never got a sensible answer about why everything got put into a Word doc.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_dikkf9,Yea... that's not how that works,"In high school (about 2-3 years ago), I worked at a locally owned computer repair shop that was praised for our quality custom built computers and excellent customer service. We had one older lady who bought a new Windows 10 desktop because her 15-20 (not exaggerating) year old computer stopped working. Quite frankly my coworkers and I were shocked it lasted that long.

Anyways, she picked up her computer and a couple of hours later she calls saying her mouse doesn't work and she's pretty fed up. I was the one who answered so I walked her through the basics.

""Make sure the USB is tightly secured""

""Try plugging it into another port""

""Is the light at the bottom on?""

Stuff like that. After about 5-10 minutes of troubleshooting, I asked her to please bring the computer back in and we can take a quick look at it for her. When she stopped in, we took the computer in the back and low and behold, the mouse worked just fine. 

We then called her to the back room to show her that the mouse was working fine and we asked if she could play with it for a couple of minutes so we can see if we can recreate the issue. 

What I saw brought me to a complete loss of words. The lady took the mouse. ***LIFTED IT OFF THE TABLE AND POINTED IT AT THE CURSOR ON THE SCREEN AND STARTED TO MOVE THE MOUSE TO WHAT SHE WANTED TO CLICK ON.""*** 

""See! It's not working again! You're lying to me so I'll have to buy a new one!""

EDIT: If you’re wondering how she used her old mouse for 20 years, my coworker had a theory. He thought since her old PC had a ball mouse and this was her first time using a laser mouse, she thought she didn’t have to keep it on the table anymore.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_dikmx5,"A is for accents, B is for bass, C is for curses.","A while back I was doing tech support for a web hosting company. The customer would give us a 4 digit code to validate their account, and I'd enter it into a box in my UI that would unlock the rest of the page. It worked pretty well, except for when it didn't.  

Anyway, I worked the graveyard shift so I'd get lots of Asian and Australian customers. I'd sometimes have trouble understanding them through the headset, but if I turned the volume up I'd usually be able to make out what they were saying.  

One day I had a very polite Australian gentleman call in about a problem he was having with his site. It was an issue I'd seen hundreds of times before, and I assured him it would be a very quick and simple fix. The only problem was his very, very deep voice, as well as his very, very strong Aussie accent. There's nothing wrong with either of those things, unless you're an agent trying to understand the double whammy of accent and pitch through a headset speaker that probably cost less to make than a single M&amp;M.  

Our story starts when I ask for the validation code.  

&gt;Me: That should be a quick fix, I just need the 4 digit validation code for your account before I can start. Would I be able to get that from you?

t3_dik8oy,"Just because you learned the word ""minimal viable product"" does not mean that you should try to make a ""minimal viable product"" in an enterprise situation.","tl;dr: The other team is trying to get us off the production server and said they'd get us all the data we use in SQL. Every new table they give us is missing data. My team is locked out of permissions to make our own views. They said that at the end of this month they'd cut off our access to the production servers if even if we didn't have all the data unless we get the capex to fund the rest of the work. Called the new server a ""minimal viable product"", when in reality it's more like a 6 month old fetus.

Been having a rough go of it at a new position. My career has been in marketing, but I pivoted and picked up enough SQL, Tableau, Python and R to get an analyst position.

My first big project is to help this other team get all of the tables we use onto the new SQL db. And by ""help"" I mean tell them which tables we are using so they they can ""copy"" them over. This data is so ugly dudes. We have titles like EmployeeID, Employee Number, EmployeeNo, PayeeID, Payee ID, Rep(either a name or an ID), Region(manager names or managerIDs), (FacilityID and BranchID are interchangeable with each other and other IDs), and sometimes they don't always mean the same ID for the employee. I'm like ""hey, you're doin all this work, maybe it's time to clean up all the columns so the next dude has an easier time?"" I told them I'd spend the extra time to clean it up if they make the tables I'll rename the columns after the fact, I'm told they won't be giving me those permissions.

We have weekly meetings to discuss the progress of this project, so today I was locked in loaded with my issues. Because last week my first big report was missing a bunch of data because the new tables that were made for us were missing a bunch of relationships. As the new guy I didn't know what was missing. So I started trying to match up old and new. The more I dig the more missing data I discover. Just the fucking audacity for them to tell me that the new server was perfectly good to use for the tables that were there. During the call one of the dudes says ""this is just a minimal viable product we're not trying to clean it all up you'll need more money for that"". But in all reality 1) what they're providing me isn't usable, if I continued to use it everything I'd turn out would be garbage. and 2) this is a change they pushed on my department, we didn't ask to be moved.

I'm super frustrated and if anyone here has any insight on why it could be so difficult for them to do what they're doing, please let me know. I plan on going in tomorrow and asking the dude I've been at it with to show me what he is working with so I can understand why it's taking them so long / going so wrong.

t3_di58js,"""But IT told me to put the confidential files in the public share!""","So this happened a good while back and still makes me facepalm to think about. Bit of background: this office had two main file shares, one for sensitive internal comms and one for all user access. You can already see where this is going.

$Me - The hero you'd have to have burned an orphanage down to deserve.

$IS - Incompetent secretary. You've all met someone whatever their position like this: makes large regular fuckups but is pathologically incapable of accepting the blame for it.

So I get a call that they're having trouble moving these very obviously confidential files for whatever reason, (some kind of permissions issue I've forgotten exactly), but that's when I notice where she's trying to back these up to.

&gt;$IS: Well I should hope not. Your colleague told me to store them here.

&gt;$Me: That would be against a number of policies and processes, could you please forward me the email in which they advised to do so?  
&gt;  
&gt;$IS: **\[Does so.\]** *CCing in my manager and her regional manager.*

Now I'm going to stop here and say that to me at least doing something like that at this stage of things is passive aggressive at best and a declaration of war at worst. Given her history I took this as the latter.

I review the email chain, and it is not in fact her being told to store them there. It is an email from when she was a new employee explaining the file storage arrangements and her access rights, with a section specifying quite clearly what not to do. She'd obviously just skimmed it, noticed the fact she has drive mappings and did her own thing. I would've been surprised nobody raised this with us sooner but she was by no means the only or even most dysfunctional staff member at that department.

As she has decided in her infinite wisdom that upper management needs to be in the loop on this, I keep them CC'd in for the rest.

&gt;$Me: Sorry I think this may be the wrong email chain? This is the guidance sent out to new employees.

t3_dihfjw,Defeated by Microsoft Office,"Today my relative wanted me to install him Microsoft Office. He liked to do hes writing with \*\*Word\*\* when it used to come pre-installed with the computer. And no Apache OpenOffice will do it for him. So I got a hold of a key for Office 2019 and got on with the task. Easy stuff.

The computer is about five years old low end laptop but it has a Office launcher installed so I start from there. Slap the activation code in and get prompted with ""This is not a Office 2013 activation key"" and it redirects me to download it from   the Microsoft Store. I ask my relative to log into his MS account, I'm able to activate the code and start the installation in the background. End of Story.

15 minutes later I come back to see that the installation process has halted to 2%. Hard drive activity had mostly seized and nothing is coming from the net. It is also at this point I remember this computer uses eMMC storage (almost like a flash memory SD card) so the transfer speeds peak at 15mb/s max.

After several attempts I check the system requirements for Office 2019 and damn, I do not have enough RAM (only 2GB out of 4). I do not believe this is strictly the issue that is softlocking the installation process, but already a shameful amount of time has passed and i decide to go for the plan B of using the 2013 launcher to activate Office 2013. I reboot the system and ask the relative to type in the passwords etc.

I quickly get a Office 2013 licence key and open the launcher. \*keep in mind that the older Office launcher asks for the activation key before logging in to MS\*. I successfully activate the key and click to install. Error ""There already is an ongoing installation for Office. Exiting installer"". SO the 2019 installer was still going in the \*\*background\*\* and the clever fucker had survived a reboot. I uninstall Office from the computer to end the installation.

Inadvertently this also removes the 2013 launcher which you cannot download from ANYWHERE. Since I already ""activated"" the licence key Microsoft refuses to link it to my relatives MS account giving the error TOKEN\_NOT\_FOUND.  I try to find a download Office 2013. Relative lives in a internet blind spot so it's pulling around half a megabyte per second. After another wasted half an hour I realise I have downloaded only a Service Pack for it. It is a security update and does nothing to progress the problem. I am an idiot.

Only way to get a download for Office is the get the key activated online.

With all the Chrome tabs open and in dire need of help i go search the MS Store for older Office versions when suddenly everything freezes. From task manager I see that the poor Celeron processor is doing full red 100% workload. It could handle chrome but the slidey graphics of the store snapped the camels back. Hard reset and ask my relative to input the passwords etc.

MS likes to keep asking the password even if you have ticked the ""Remember me"" -box so by this time my relative has had to do this around twenty times. I do not ask the password since every time I ask him to type it it is the ""last time"". After fiddling some more it's getting really late and I've run out of time for today.

Five hours it took to for me to realise I am not match for MS Office and I'm baffled. My understanding of reality is bending and I am in a state of deliriousness with a blank stare out the window. I do not remember the drive home.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_diewh2,Windows 2000 Advanced Server issue...,"Some time ago I inherited a server room with a bunch of so called servers. Sadly, most of them didn't have any redundant components, backups or UPS. I had my hands full to upgrade as many as possible to minimum business grade specs, with the least amount of money the CFO wanted to make available. Well, really, he didn't want to spend any money, TBH.

One day we had another power outage and most of the hardware had rebooted, as there still wasn't any UPS in that room. I am looking at this Windows 2000 Advanced Server, which had a RAID 1 configuration, but nevertheless was showing me a friendly blue screen. Another ""have you tried to turn if off and back on again"" sequence didn't solve the problem, so I proceeded to investigate the issue a little more, as I had users calling me, asking what happened to that server. While the server had a RAID card, it no longer had an optical drive, so I couldn't boot off the install CD. This was also so long ago, it didn't want to boot at all from an USB stick.

The simple solution was to run a generic chkdsk, which was supposed to fix the issue. Running RAID 1 did actually save my bacon, as I also didn't (yet) have a tested and reliable backup: I took out one of the 2 drives, which luckily was SATA, and added it as a 2nd drive to my workstation. I was then able to run the chkdsk on that drive from there. It finished fixing all the errors, and I was ready to plug it back into the server. But first I took out the other drive, which had an unfixed copy of the data, and I didn't want to risk rebuilding the RAID, if the fix didn't work.

To my utter surprise the box did indeed boot from the fixed drive, as if nothing ever happened. Once it did, I decided to put the other drive back in, and rebuilt the mirror. A few short hours later that was also done, and the machine was back to where it was before the power went.

I immediately went to the CFO's office and told him we needed UPS, and backup solutions for ALL machines. He agreed that would be necessary, even though he still wasn't overly convinced to throw money at this problem.

Sadly, I lost power two more times before I could set up a permanent solution, which forced me to verify my above system was functional to get the server back online. I also upgraded to Windows 2003 Server then, which was slightly more resilient.

t3_di5kae,A music collection on my server?

After a while,  one of our dev servers had about 10GB of space disappear and it was pretty tight.   The dev environment manager came to me to figure it out.  It turned out,  one of the developers had pulled down 10GB of music,  hidden it on a share and was streaming it over the RDP session. 

Rather than just delete this collection of Hindi music,  i decided to get creative.   I wrote a batch file that collected all the filenames,  and instead of deleting,  replaced the content of the file with the crazy frog.   The total size when done,  only used 250MB.  

The dev env manager was worried asking what happens if the guy complains.  I explained that it would never happen,  who complains that their illegally copied music library stored on the server owned by the company that your company is contacted to has been corrupted?  Who would they complain to and how would they keep their job after admitting to illegally storing copyrighted music on a client's servers?

t3_di80wf,The transfer volume,"Back when HyperCard was on the way out and SuperCard was the shizz - before Millennials were invented and before the Millennium bug had been considered, at the dawn of the Internet, I wrote Interactive Multi Media Software for a living.

Our small team occupied a double-demountable (think two 40-foot containers welded side by side with actual windows and linoleum on the floor).

Our home away from home was connected to the world via a 10 Mbit Ethernet connection. It served us well for Gopher and the early days of Mozilla. Most of the traffic was email and telnet.

Our group produced interactive training software for the whole organisation. Given the graphical nature of our efforts we tended to store our stuff on our local drives. All Macintosh environment, with a IIfx being the cream of the crop until I scored a Quadra 950.

In those days drives were measured in Megabytes, not Gigabytes. Much of our storage consisted of external SCSI drives - daisy chained together to create a collection of storage volumes.

As an aside, I really do miss SCSI ID rotation selectors and SCSI terminators - not.

Given that we tended to shuffle files around, we built our own little AppleTalk LAN. AppleShare allowed us to create network shares. Typically a folder somewhere that you shared with the group, so you could move stuff around.

I was fortunate enough to have a Syquest drive (it might have been a PLI drive)

One of the characteristics of this drive was that you could remove the cartridge and insert another. I had stacks of these. I don't recall if I had the new 44 Mb cartridges, or the ""old"" 22 Mb ones. Either way, I formatted a cartridge and called it ob1.transfer and shared it with the team. Every couple of weeks or so I'd empty it, so that there was always a spot to chuck a file when you were in a hurry.

One member of our team, Sue, was the graphic artist. She was a Whizz on design, knew her way around Photoshop like no-one I knew.

Sue had two interesting quirks.

One bit us, the other bit her, both involved thin air.

The one that bit us involved grouping of SuperCard objects. You could group a bunch of objects and then attach a script to that now grouped object. When you ungouped it, the script would vanish into thin air, never to be seen again.

Sue was a particular person, very detail oriented. If something was one pixel out of place, she'd move it. If that involved one object in a group, she'd un-group it, move the offending item by one pixel and then sometimes re-group the various objects again. Of course the script was long gone by then. Many hours of debugging often followed a Sue revision.

As to the other quirk, Sue had lots of files on her computer. She hoarded them, was always low on disk-space. She had dozens of versions of the same image, one pixel altered. She'd have this for all of our projects - because you never know if you're going to need it.

One day I tried to copy something to my transfer volume, but it was full. I emptied it, copied the file across, told whomever it was that the file was on my transfer volume and got on with my day.

The next day (as I recall - could have been more), Sue asks me about a folder she's looking for. It's got the latest versions of the graphics for a project in it and she can't find it.

I asked her where she'd last seen it, since Sue was known to accidentally move folders inside folders.

Her answer: ""Oh, I put it on the ob1.transfer volume""

Thin air ...


She lost a week's worth of work, learnt the value of backups, actually started using cartridge drives herself and never ever used a transfer volume as permanent storage ever again.

She also managed to obtain the first WORM (Write Once Read Many times) drive in our organisation. If I recall correctly, it had 80 Mb discs.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_di1ygb,There's been a fax-ident...,"Back in the spring of 2018, I had just finished creating an online submission system for the veterinary lab where I work. Previously, we would spend 2-3 hours a day on data entry, just deciphering and transcribing what our clients (generally veterinarians or their technicians) had written on the paper forms. For sample submissions that used our online form, however, we would just open the box, scan the barcode, and click the ""Accept"" button to import the data into our database. This would save us at least an hour or two each day, so I was pretty proud of it. In my ""free"" time over the course of about a year, I designed the online form, integrated it with FedEx Web Services, set up the database servers on the back end to handle the data, etc., and tested it extensively; now, it was finally ready for prime time.  I'm sure you can imagine my excitement.

The trouble is, it only works when our clients know to use it. I needed to get the word out. So I created a pretty neat little flyer extolling the virtues of our new online submission form (""Reduce human error!"" ""Print a FedEx label!""), and I queried our database to find the fax numbers of our hundred or so most active clients.

Our database front-end client is Microsoft Access-based, so I wrote a VBA script to cycle through the client list and send each of them a copy of the flyer via fax. The code looked a little something like this:

    'Create outgoing fax job.
    Dim objFaxDocument As Object
    Set objFaxDocument = CreateObject(""FaxComEx.FaxDocument"")
        
    While Not rst.EOF
        'Set properties of outgoing fax and submit it.
        With objFaxDocument
            .Recipients.Add rst.Fields(""Clinic_FAX""), rst.Fields(""Clinic_Name"")
            .Subject = ""Check out our new submission form!""
            .Body = Environ(""Temp"") &amp; ""\OnlineSubmissionFlyer.tif""
            .DocumentName = rst.Fields(""Clinic_Name"")
            .Submit """"
        End With
        rst.MoveNext
    End While

Because my phone line doubles as my fax line, and because it was Friday, I queued it up not long before I left for the weekend. I watched the first one to make sure they were sending properly, and everything looked good. They were still being generated, but for 100 faxes, that was going to take a few minutes. I wasn't sure how long it would take for all 100 of them to go through, but I didn't expect it to take more than a couple of hours.

Imagine my surprise when I walked in Monday morning to find that these faxes were still going out.

More worryingly, we had several emails and voice messages begging us to stop sending them faxes.

Oops.

You've probably already seen my mistake, and now you're sitting there grinning about it. And that's all well and good for someone reading TFTS stories from the comfort of the employee restroom. But for anyone not familiar with VBA or the FaxComEx library, here's what happened:

I created a recordset containing the recipient fax numbers. I created a fax document. I created a loop that adds a recipient fax to the fax document, sends the fax, and moves on to the next recipient fax number. What I did **not** have was a line that *removed* the recipient fax number.

So the first fax went to the first recipient. The second fax went to the second recipient... *and* the first recipient. The third fax went to the third, second, and first recipients. And so on.

By Monday morning, the first recipient had received the same fax **71 times**. Each subsequent recipient had received it 1 less time than the previous recipient.

Once I had stopped the remaining outgoing faxes, responded to all of the emails and voice mails, and corrected my code to send exactly 1 copy to each of the remaining 29 or so recipients, I composed an apology fax... and sent it only once this time.

Honestly, I found the whole thing hilarious. Yeah, it was embarrassing, but inexplicably amusing. Fortunately, my boss had the reaction I was hoping for, and we laughed about it for a while. I still can't help but laugh about it every time I think about this ""fax-ident.""

Of course, the next fax-ident got the police involved... But that's a tale for another day.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: To all the folks who think I'm a moron who doesn't test his code before running it: I wrote this script long ago and it's been in production without issue for the past 7 years. The only difference was that I trimmed the loop down to remove the part where it generates a new document to send with each fax. In doing so, I accidentally put the ""While Not rst.EOF"" line on the wrong side of the ""Set objFaxDocument..."" line. It was no longer creating a new fax document.

So yes, my familiarity with the code and its years of dependability led me to think I could execute it without carefully stepping through each line and studying its effects. As the only one managing the database (both server back-end and MS Access front-end), designing the website, writing the LIS middleware to interface between the database and the analyzer, and various IT-related tasks that somehow arise around the lab, I get a little rushed sometimes. And yes, in this case, I should have tested my loop a bit more thoroughly, despite still being at work at 8pm on a Friday. But here's the story for your enjoyment, so go ahead. Point and laugh.

The spreadsheet asked a lot of static information like amount of RAM and hard drive size. Then several things that changed almost daily like free space on data share, number of databases running and number of possible users (that is basically a guess). It was plain idiotic and time consuming.

Several months later all IT managers were meeting at corporate and the man who thought up this brain child excel report gave a 10 minute speech on the value of this information and then asked for questions. I raised my hand.

Me: ""So what good is it""

Speaker: ""What do you mean?""

Me: ""Well, this report is all well and good but honestly why do you need to know ... lets say ... how much free space is on my server? If it is full are you going to automatically ship me a bigger server or maybe bigger drives to install?""

Speaker: ""Well, no of course not.""

Me: ""Then I repeat. What good is it? Why do I need to spend my time filling out this information that will not create an action item to resolve any actual problem.""

This immediately spurred almost every manager there to speak out on their own problems with the report. Two weeks later it was removed from our responsibilities. I hate busy work.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_dhzsdm,Sweet elderly lady setting up email,"So this was years ago when I was front line tech support for a US ISP.

Sweet elderly lady calls in to setup her email, either Incredimail or Outlook Express, I can't recall which but they're both literally the same.  I walk her through getting into the settings just like I've done hundreds of times before.  She's just not following along (as people often do).

We get to the 20 minute mark, so I change my tactic and try to get her into the settings a different way...there's not many ways, mind you, but I try all the same.

We get to the 30 minute mark, and I'm drained.  Late for my lunch break, too.  So I change my tactic once again: ""is there anyone else there that I might be able to talk to?""

She says ""my grandson is here if you'll talk to him..?""

At this point, I'll happily speak with anyone else, so I tell her if he's okay speaking to me, I'm okay speaking to him.

He says ""hello"" and tells me his name.  He must be 7 or 8 years old!  HOORAY!  I  think to myself this is going to o be another 30 minutes.  I start where I did with the grandma, and he's I. To the email settings as quick as anyone.  I walk him through through inputting all of the settings and whatnot.  Within 3 minutes, I'm sending a test message to his grandma's email address and tell him to reply so we can confirm incoming and outgoing both work.  He gets my message and replies with ""hi"".  I then notice in the ""from:"" line that the email is from none other than ""SpongeBob SquarePants""!  I tell him I just need to let his grandma know it's working, so he puts her on the line.  I let her know how great of a job he did and the call is over!  I never told her what he'd done, it was too funny (and I'd had it with that call by then).",talesfromtechsupport
t3_dhte8h,Ghosts in the machines,"This one might bore a lot of you. I'm sure there's a completely reasonable explanation that has nothing to do with anything supernatural.

That said, I'm a rookie that knows little about networking, and it baffled me and the tech, so here I am! To preface this, we're a HUGE company with an even huger portfolio of tech to support, so we outsource a lot of it. Networks are handled by a different company. We make sure to get them info like what lights are on, power status, cable connectivity, restart router, and then they send the tech.

Normal day, lots of work being done, kinda proud of things so far.. and then he calls.

Site has no internet again. Except.. the router seems connected to our system fine, which he even acknowledges. Router is fine, devices have no IPs. So I dig a bit, and.. find devices with IPs. That's no biggie, our portal sometimes keeps old IPs that aren't actually working anymore.

I connect to one of their computers without issue. 

Me: ""Hey, I've connected to the computer so you're good to go.""

Him: ""Weird, I could've sworn we didn't have internet! Thanks, never mind then.""

Me: ""Yeah it's weird like that sometimes, see this icon down he-..""

Icon says no internet connection.

Me: ""Huh, the icon must be incorrect since I'm connected, lemme just open a browser..""

Browser can't connect to any sites. No internet.

Me: ""Huh.""

Him: ""Huh.""

My coworkers crowding around me: ""Huh.""

t3_di166x,Moving to a new server - copy the databases across... oops.. oops again....,"I was reminded of this today when one of my colleagues was trying to shrink a MSSQL tempdb without having to restart the finance system - it was hitting 1.5TB and almost filling the drive.  Not sure if he fixed it, I had to go to a meeting about wireless.

So, in the mid 2000's I worked for a UK '1992 group' university (not one of the 'old established' ones).  I was the oddity as I was a department tech who handled all the computers, server and web server for the psychology course - it wasn't run by the main IT department who I had a decent working relationship with.

Anyway, we were moving campuses and as part of that we managed to get a new Sun microsystems (before they got borged) server paid for under the move costs as the old Ultra 5 wouldn't wasn't rackable (where it would need to be).  I was working with the only IT staffer who was a unix admin (he often bounced questions off me and asked my advice when he had an issue).

We were in my office carrying out the actual transfer to the new server - after it was setup and ready.  All the files for the webserver and the various weird systems I had created during my time.  All that was left was the databases themselves, which, at the time, were on MySQL.

I types the commands to transfer the data (and the other unix admin didn't see anything wrong), which ran rather quickly.....  So I thought... huh.....

I checked - I'd just mixed up the commands....  no databases on the old server, no worries.... I had a copy that had been made, just in case.  So we once again tried to copy the data.    Guess what - we goofed again and wiped out our only backup.   Normally, the server was backed up daily - because it was currently 'balanced' on a rack in the DMZ server room, there was no way to back it up.  FYI, I have backups and am good with them - they way the whole move and server move process occurred made it a mess and backups were now out of my hands.

So, we sit there for a few minutes wondering what the heck to do.  No current database backup, my last 'copy' was on my test server and, although good, was 3 months out of date.  Several thousand forum posts and a lot of other information was missing.   We discuss a few options (data recovery etc) but I suddenly have a brainwave.

Me, being me, had a transaction log running - and the last time it was cleared was several months ago.  I copy the 3 month old data, to the new server (both of us triple checking the commands but I also had a DVD copy of this data also).  I then extract the transaction log into a 'sql' file.  Crossed my fingers and ran the log file through the database.  The other guy, wasn't a DB admin so understood what I was doing, left me too it (he was good guy at realizing when not to help as well when to help).

The import finally completed and I started  up the webserver itself.  Then gingerly checked everything.  Happily enough, after running a check on all the databases everything was working and almost everything was working fine.  The only problem I had was a few users had messed up 'number of posts' on the forum I ran for the students.  A quick run of the sanity checker on the forum software and everything was working.

Afterwards, I send an email to all the staff saying the webserver was up and that I needed a drink as we had a few issues.  If they urgently needed me, I would be in the Student Union bar having something a little stronger than tea (I only had a single pint of ale).

Yes, we probably should have made more backups (I usually have) - the circumstances were not the best at the time and I had enough trouble just getting some of the 'basics'.  One of these days I should post on how I finally managed to convince the dept to get a UPS for the servers......",talesfromtechsupport

So, my husband does all kinds of trouble-shooting for IT. Last week he was called out to a complex in Compton, California. Compton may have good areas to it, but this was not a “crime-free” area. 

The people at the complex told hubby that they weren’t able to connect to the internet. After  a while of trying to figure out where the problem was stemming from, he figured it came “from the box down the street” (I don’t know what that means, but I hope you all do). 

He then went to check out the “box” and found the problem. Apparently, the “box” had dozens of bullet-holes in it. One of the bullets severed the cable that delivered internet to the complex he was working on.

She begrudgingly gives me the address again and this time I actually hear what the street is so I can pull of the account.  Given the number of people accessing the account in $state, my guess is they asked for address, but she may have been less rushed to give it.  I ask who I’m talking to and for pin

t3_dha0xg,"Well, that was an early morning surprise.","First call of the day today, this lady got back from vacation and was having issues getting her computer to turn on. Apparently this issue isn't uncommon based on her explanation of why she doesn't shut the computer down very often.

Issue - Computer tower light comes on briefly for a second and then shuts right back off.  
Advice - Don't hold the power button; hit it and quit it.  
Result - Powers on without a problem.

Bigger Problem: She's been doing this method of powering on her computer for some unknown length of time prior to today and never realized that she shouldn't hold the power button. \~shrug.

Even though the main issue has been resolved, she requested I stay on the phone (as they all do) to 'verify it works' -- as if we didn't get further than she had before and already have a 200%+ productivity increase, but I'll amuse her. She gets to the point of entering her password and immediately--

t3_dgl934,Unbridled Rage,"**Do you like to read in Chronological order? Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**

 &amp;nbsp;

**$Selben:** Me! A Tier II ~~helldesk~~ helpdesk technician for a mid-sized company, with a very skeleton-crew helpdesk. 10 of us total for 24-hour coverage (not including supervisors) to support 2500+ company-wide.

**$Snickers:** My cubicle mate, a good friend, and also Tier II.

**$Enraged_user:** The star.

**$Sup2:** All around great supervisor. Worked his way up from the support line and understands how the helpdesk works.

&amp;nbsp;

$Selben and $Snickers shared a bag of cheesy crackers, while giggling at videos on the Internet, and enjoying the quiet hum of machines with the occasional click of a mouse. All was peaceful in the early morning hours until…

The door to the IT area burst open.

$Selben dared peek around the corner only to lock eyes with $Enraged_user who pointed his finger and walked straight at him. Without hesitation, $Snickers had retreated into a pile of emails, leaving $Selben to fend for himself.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; $Enraged_user: You! I need files moved to my flash drive!

He said this while shoving a personal drive at $Selben.

&gt; $Selben: I uh, sure… What files did you need moved?

He did not like the question, and angrily stomped his feet, checking over his shoulder.

&gt; $Enraged_user: Important company files!!!

$Selben’s eyebrow shot up at least an inch in pure confusion.

&gt; $Enraged_user: I’ll be back for those later!

He stormed off, leaving $Selben holding the flash drive.

&gt; $Snickers: Who was that?

&gt; $Selben: I… Don’t know?

&amp;nbsp;

Having no idea who the end user was or what they wanted, he left the flash drive untouched on his desk and went about his day. Around noon, $Snickers suggested they leave to get lunch. Upon their return, $Selben was caught on his way in by $Enraged_user, seemingly from nowhere…or possibly the bush by the door.

&amp;nbsp;

In a harsh whisper he spoke:

&gt; $Enraged_user: Where is the flash drive?!

He glared angrily.

&gt; $Selben: It’s on my desk. I wasn’t exactly sure…

He cut him off abruptly.

&gt; $Enraged_user: Bring it to me!

&gt; $Selben: Uh, okay?

&amp;nbsp;

The technicians passed through the doors, but $Enraged_user seemed to recoil like an invisible forcefield held them at bay (or he was avoiding cameras, $Selben later thought). $Selben retrieved the drive and headed back. As he reached for the door, $Sup2 walked in.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; $Sup2: Hey $Selben.

&gt; $Selben: Hello! Just giving this to $Enraged_user really quick, and I’ll get back on the phones.

&gt; $Sup2: Oh? What’s on it?

&gt; $Selben: Nothing. They wanted some files but didn’t tell me what was needed.

$Sup2 let out a sigh, turned and opened the door, while holding $Selben back gently with one hand.

&gt; $Sup2: Get out of here $Enraged_user. You have to leave company property. They let you go man.

$Enraged user began to shout and angrily stomp his feet. He pointed his finger with an evil, knowing grin.

&gt; $Enraged_user: You’ll never get any of the company emails to the vendors. I REFUSE to give you my password!!!

&gt; $Sup2: We’re IT. We already changed your password. We have all the emails, bud…
 
$Enraged_user screeched like some sort of animal and threw himself to the ground in the most epic display of pure rage $Selben had ever witnessed, far surpassing a four-year-old having a meltdown in a $Pizza_rat game room.

&amp;nbsp;

After about 30 minutes, police arrived, and $Enraged_user was trespassed from the property. He had worked at the company for 10 years, but apparently had been using his company card for MANY personal expenditures and was let go.

$Selben is unsure if $Enraged_user was ever made to repay the company.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_dgllc0,How do I do that?,"When I was in college, I worked in the computer lab to earn extra money as a part of financial assistance. While the computer lab staff were there to provide assistance to the users, if it became clear that they needed hand-holding for an extended period, we had to hand them over to special services. We simply didn't have the people to be able to spend dedicated time with one user.

One day an older lady flagged me and asked for help writing a paper. It's not an uncommon request, the college that I attended had a program for older students, and many of them were unfamiliar with Word, etc.

I sat down beside her and told her to open Word.

Lady: ""How do I do that?""

Me: ""Take the mouse and move it so that you can click on the Start button in the corner.""

Lady: ""How?""

I took the mouse and demonstrated how it worked making sure to point out that movements of my hand/mouse matched the movements on screen.

She took the mouse in hand and started the journey to the start menu.

When I say journey, I mean it. As I watched, the mouse on screen moved in a slow series of ""S"" curves, slowly wending its way to the start menu. I kid not when I say that it must have taken her two to three minutes to find her way to the start menu. She turned to me.

Lady: ""Now what?""

Me: ""Do you see where it says Microsoft?""

Lady: ""Yes.""

Me: ""Move the mouse there and stop.""

Again, the mouse starts an arduous and long journey to the appropriate section. Her movements were so slow that each category opened as she moved past. After a couple of minutes, she finally arrived.

Lady: ""Now what?""

Me: ""Do you see where is says Word?""

Lady: ""Yes.""

Me: ""Move the mouse there and click the left button.""

Same drill. Slow meandering movements, but this time, she kept moving off of the submenu to the other categories, closing the submenu and opening the others.

Finally, after several failed attempts, she managed to open word. Once done, I turned to her and in my kindest, most gentle, non-condescending voice I could manage, told her that we would be happy to get someone from special services to tutor her in using the computer and that I couldn't because of limited personnel.

It made me afraid to know that she drives on the same roads that I did.

t3_dgj64e,It can't be! It has never done that before!,"TL;DR

Lawyer didn't believe me when I told him that his cordless phone was killing his connection to his router, even though I showed him a spectrum analysis.

\--

Back in the day when 802.11g was the standard, I worked for an ISP that I have mentioned in other posts.

A longtime customer of ours, a lawyer, called in one day stating that when he used his cordless phone, his wifi cut out. You can see this coming, I'm sure.

Facts: When we installed his system, he didn't want any holes drilled in his walls or cables running in channels along the walls. It didn't matter that we could make it really nice with wall plates and discrete channels that we could hide. His personal router was actually outside in a weather proof container so that there were no wires coming into the building. The phone in question was an add on to his existing wired phone network that gave him a weird keypad/headset system that he just \*had\* to have.

We had a WiSpy. Nice device. 2.4GHz analyzer that had a PC app. I took this and my laptop and headed out.

I setup and got the WiSpy up and running and showed him the graph, explaining that one of the spikes was his router and another was for our AP on the top of the hill behind him. (Ours was a point-to-point fixed wireless network with customer premise enterprise gear pointed at our AP, then hooked to his router. Standard setup for our clients.) The third clear channel (of which 2.4Ghz has only three, the rest overlap) was his neighbor's WiFi router. Since we strenuously avoided overlapping channels, the only option for his router was the channel that he already had.

While he watched the display, I had him take his cordless phone off-hook. Sure enough, a \*huge\* spike went right up through his connection to his router, at twice the power. What followed was an explanation of 2.4GHz history and why his router connection went offline due to his phone and how I couldn't change the router channel due to interference. I even showed him the graph while he turned on his microwave. It looked like a speech waveform all across the spectrum. Predictably, he didn't believe me and insisted that it couldn't have been his phone because ""it never did this before.""

When it became clear that he was unwilling to part with his beloved phone, I left, telling him to contact my boss, who would explain the exact same thing. I think that we got a couple more calls from him, but in the end, his complaints stopped.

t3_dgexfr,have you tried what i said?,"This just happened. I work internally at a small company, i've done years at the client facing end of tech support and you get to recognise very quickly those who are genuinely helpful and respect you when they need a problem solved, and there are others who believe you are some form of servant and never pay attention to information or alerts you give to them.

This person is one of the latter, i needed to hound him to bring him into line with the companies upgraded security proceedures, really important stuff from the CEO, but when he gets the slightest problem with the most basic of things the high importance emails start flying with the words acronym ASAP plastered everywhere.

his email "" For some reason I can’t print from my home printer. Is there any reason why this may be happening? Quite urgent that I print ASAP.""

my resposne ""sorry to hear that, are you working remotely on your office computer and trying to print on your home printer, or working just on the home computer? Anyway, let's do the quick tests first, can you do a test page from your home computer to the printer please? ""

him "" Yes, when working remotely from home. When I print nothing happens and then it would just say that it was redirecting print. There is nothing that pops on the screen now though""

me ""ok, but can you try the test print on your home computer, we need to check the basics first""

we then back and forth several times, him pointing the blame at a security app on his phone that went on 3 weeks ago, or new technologies that have'nt even gone in yet. but everytime never answering the same question ""can you print a test page?""

I'm not normally reluctant to do remote support sessions, they make life so easy, but this guy wants a remote session for everything no matter how minor. Things like releasing a spam mail from his quarantine, it takes three clicks, everyone else in the company does it themselves, but this guy thinks i am his butler. I'm getting to the point where i'm going to have to remote on to do the test page when i get the reply.

""printer says it's out of ink""

I can get away with a lot with the way i talk to colleauges, jokingly accusing them of smoking crack if they ask absurd things, as i never overstep the boundaries of respect, but in this case it took a lot of professionalism to not respond ""you could have saved yourself 20 minutes of complaining and 'this is really important' willy waving if you had listened!""

t3_dg4sca,"Just to be clear, you're asking how much resources would the server consume when the whole site is offline?","Background: I'm working with a technical client who use to work in our IT from late 00's up until 6 years ago and got promoted to a manager. Usually he is easy to deal with and I can talk to him without removing tech talk from the conversation as he helped to build a lot of our current setup back in the day.

The system is an external facing system with a very large customer base and a massive footprint in our infrastructure this is only dealing with one part of the system.

Note: anything in quotes has been changed to keep with the anonymity rule.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hi 'Client' I've been asked to call you as we need to talk about the amount of resources your servers in VMware are holding, mainly memory as we are dangerously low. I've done the research and I've come to the conclusion that each of your servers no longer needs 40gb of memory, since if you remember we split the load that these systems were processing from 2 servers to 6 servers over our two sites back in April, during the test we kept the same resources for the 6 servers as we had allocated in the 2 server configuration. I now want to lower each servers memory from 40gb assigned to 24gb assigned to each per server as they no longer need that much resources.

Client: well that is what the specs say on 'APP' documentation so we can't lower it.

Me: Yes I wrote and updated that documentation a year ago when this project began, if you look at the bottom of the article, it says based on a 2 system configuration and that resources should be scaled down if we ever decided to scale out the server infrastructure, when I wrote the documentation their was a possible plan to chop up 'APP' into smaller pieces and now that we have the load on a single server isn't what it use to be.

Client: I believe the systems still use all the resources so if anything we need more, we can't have the 'APP' going down.

Me: here is a graph showing memory usage on these servers from the last 6 months since we moved to a 6 server setup, on average the servers are consuming less then 10gb of memory and even at its peak when we lost our secondary site '2ndSITE' due to that large power outage, when we were operating out of '1stSITE' only for two days, each of the remaining nodes were only consuming 19gb of memory at their peak.

Client: well what happens if you lose both sites won't that mean that the servers will start consuming double those resources again and we still need 40gb of memory?

Me: (30 seconds of silence while my brain computes what they just said) Are you asking how much memory a servers would consume if we lost both of our sites at once?

Client: Yes wouldn't that mean the server would consume double the resources of the the already doubled load?

Me: (30 more seconds of silence as I felt a small trickle of blood well in my nose) Just to be clear you're asking if we lost both sites that host our servers due to a power outage or network outage like we did during the last power outage, you're asking how much resources would the server consume at that site when the whole site is offline?

Client: (30 seconds of silence on their end) ohh......... I'll address it with my team today and get back to you.",talesfromtechsupport

I am part of an US based unmanaged support team and our customers have full access to their servers on the command line.

""ERROR: Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Exception: SQLSTATE\[HY000\]: General error: 1 Can't create/write to file '/tmp/\*\*\*\*""

I take a look at the server and is still responding on the network to ssh so its all intact. All good.

Me: "" I have just checked and you server is responding to ssh, so you are able  to login so you are able to log in and troubleshoot the issue further..""

NTWD:  ""sorry, but I don't know how to acces via SSH. Could you please help me to access with SSH? ""

Me: "" I use an application called putty when it starts up I simply enter the machines IP address into the application and hit return.Your server responds with a ""login as"" prompt so the server is  responding on the network and this would seem to be a server side issue.  This error would suggest that the server is unable to write to a /tmp filesystem, this could be because the file system is full or some other  error. Either way the you need to log into his server and investigate  further   ""

NTWD: "" Unfortunately I'm not a server specialist (just a simple web designer :-) ...)   Using putty, it's like using a remote desktop? I mean... I can see the folders of all the domain in that server?  I really don't know what to do...""

At this point I throw my minds eye hands in the air, the guy has a linux box without any clue on how to use it.  Understanding that its important that he gets access and that I can fix it remotely .. I offer a remote hands session as a purchased extra.

Me:  ""I can offer a remote hands service where I would log into the server and  perform a health check on the server's filesystem as the  error looks like its storage-related which I can investigate for you. ""

At this point he closed the ticket and that was the end of it, all he really wanted was for me to remote into his machine and make his problem go away.

I looked through old tickets and it seems like this guy was just using us as generic support instead of hiring an actual sysadmin. It looked like he had had the conversation about putty a number of times before..

Anyway. One of my co-workers came to me that she couldn't log in. I came over to her desk and she showed me that at the login screen different letters appeared than that she pressed on the keyboard. My first thought was that the keyboard locale/lay-out was set to a different language. I quickly checked the settings but it was set to correct layout. 

My colleague pressed some more letters and I noticed that when she pressed 'w' an 'å' appeared. I immediately looked at the right alt key and pressed it a couple of times. It came unstuck and now the correct letters showed on the screen.
  
""How did you know it was the right alt key that was stuck?"" My co-worker asked. A few years ago I learned myself some Swedish, mostly through online courses. I quickly learned myself the keyboard shortcuts for ä, å and ö. So when I saw an 'å' appear when she pressed 'w' I saw the connection immediately.

t3_dg48ke,But the technology was always advancing!!,"TL;DR

My manager couldn't be convinced that wired ethernet was more capable than wireless in almost every way, because the ""technology was always advancing!""

\-----

If you have read any of my previous posts, you will notice that one is about a small municipality. This municipality will be the subject of a few more posts, including this one.

At this municipality, IT didn't have a very big budget. As a result, we didn't always purchase the best of equipment. Case in point: the wireless routers were consumer grade and not integrated into the DHCP of the rest of the network.

My mistake: I edited an ISC dhcpd config file as the last item of the day and neglected to check the config for errors. Next morning no one but my boss (a mining manager by education) could get on the Internet. I forgot a "";"" and the server failed. I had a backup server, but I had made the config self-replicating, so no good. &lt;facepalm!&gt;

The fallout: My boss walked from person to person with his Surface and asked if anyone could get online. Since he was the only one on wireless, which used the AP DHCP server, he concluded that wireless was more reliable. When I came in, I found the problem and fixed it handily. Sure enough, within a few minutes, everyone was online.

Extended fallout: Now that my boss had it firmly in his mind that not only was wireless more convenient, but also more reliable than wired, we was making a push to do away with the cabling. When I tried to explain that a network switch was capable of handling far more data than even the best wireless access point, he would argue that ""the technology is always advancing!"" When I explained that the laws of physics prevented a wireless access point from handling the same amount of data as network switch, he argued that ""the technology is always advancing!"" When I again tried to explain how wired was almost always preferable for communication reliability, he didn't even let me finish. He just argued that ""the technology is always advancing!""

It didn't matter that I had, before this job, worked with one of the best in the business re: wireless technology. It didn't matter that one of the stock holders and architects of the wireless ISP for whom I worked previously was an engineer that had worked for NASA and knew \*exactly\* what he was doing. (In working with him it was immediately obvious. The fact that he worked for NASA didn't automatically qualify him.) It didn't matter that the IT director of a nearby municipality made the same argument regarding wired vs. wireless. In his mind, wireless was going to always be better.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.

What was sad for me was that in the next couple of days, DLink or someone announced their first 802.11ac router that had beam forming, which would do directional wireless communication with compatible wireless cards, giving wireless something loosely akin to switching. Still though, not as good as wires. But, the technology is always advancing!",talesfromtechsupport
t3_dfzu5l,Blowing Breakers... a space heater story.,"**TL;DR-** Florida man realizes it's cold in Pennsylvania, wreaks havok with a space heater

&amp;#x200B;

So about 2 years ago, i banned space heaters from the customer service department in the company i work for. I'm not sure why in the 21 yr history of the company nobody has thought to do this before... but apparently i'm the super-genius that got tired of flipping breakers. Fast forward to this week... (mind you, it just turned autumn here, the lowest temp in the past 2 weeks has been like 65 degrees. not that cold.)  


Monday. Blown breaker. takes out half of customer service and part of our data entry team. Ok, we've had a lot of turn over in the past 2 years (even tho the manager has been here long enough to remember the ban hammer), so i send an email to that team reiterating that space heaters are not to be used.

Tuesday. Blown breaker. same story. another email this time with CAPS.

Today, 10 minutes after i walk in the door. One of our lead developers comes running into my office screeching that half the dev team has no power, and they all had a ton of stuff open that nobody had saved in days and they just lost everything and wtf is going on?! I hadn't had a sip of coffee yet, so my initial reaction was ""well you should all be better about saving your work."" I go flip the breaker again, and today we're going to skip the email and go straight to the source.

&amp;#x200B;

I Leroy Jenkins into the customer service office, un-sipped coffee still in hand, like a cop on a drug raid demanding everyone surrender their space heaters. A particular shift supervisor who has only been here about 6 months (and whom i passionately disdain) explains to me:  


$Sup- well i just sold my car and bought me and my fiance each a motorcycle. So tuesday it was raining and i got soaked on my way in and was freezing and this morning was really cold as well so i plugged in a space heater to warm up.

(this id10t was originally from florida and decided to move here to Pittsburgh for some reason, and then decided that a motorcycle was suitable for year round transportation)

$Me- Why the shit would you sell your car and buy a motorcycle and have no other means of transportation in Pittsburgh.... when the weather is turning?! wtf is wrong with you?! and you took out have of dev so they all want your head on a spike right now. NO MORE SPACE HEATERS, IDGAF IF THERE'S A BLIZZARD AND IT'S -10 OUTSIDE. NEVER. AGAIN.

t3_dg0z83,"The Switch, The Broccoli, and the Battery","Got a call Monday while I was driving home that the MDF at one of our locations smelled like an electrical fire - Had a tech in the area go check it out and he reported that the MDF STUNK BAD, and that the main switch in the MDF was hot to the touch. I told him to unplug it and I'd replace it in the AM.

Got in an hour early Tuesday (OT) with one of my building techs - dropped the config on a replacement switch in my main building, drove it over and replaced the switch (I left the old one hung in the rack because poor cable management would've made it very difficult, I figured I'd pop in on a weekend (more OT) pull some patch cables and get it out then). I could barely smell anything that smelled like an electrical short, but every once in a while I'd catch a slight bit. I chalked that up to the powered off bad switch giving up the ghost.

Wednesday I got a call from the building that it started smelling bad in there again, my building tech cut his lunch short and when he got there he could smell something ""odd"" but they chalked it up to someone heating up broccoli in the adjacent room's micro, it wasn't overwhelming but it was definitely something. He checked it again before he left for the day and it smelled ""clear"".

Thursday AM, I get the call again, the smell was back! I grab some more tools, plan on pulling that old switch even if it meant bringing some endpoints down for a few minutes and we'll see why this powered off switch might still be producing an odor. I was able to cut a few zip ties (sigh) and I was able to wrestle the old switch out without bringing anyone down (yea!) The switch didn't smell at all. I stick my nose ALL over the place in that closet and I can't smell anything like an electrical fire or broccoli or anything. I felt all of the switches they all were slightly warm (about as warm as you'd expect a switch to be) and NOTHING.

It was a real head scratcher. . . .then I smelled it . . . but couldn't tell where it might be coming from, it wasn't the switches. I start putting my nose up to EVERY piece of equipment in the place and I found it - one of the external battery packs in our battery backup had that unmistakable odor - It was 2nd in line of a daisy chained set of 4 so I bypassed the battery (again without bringing anything down) and pulled the pack out of the rack it was HOT. we finally found the culprit. we took the battery pack out back and opened it up and 4 of the 9 batteries were extremely swollen

The head unit of the backup charges the external batteries on a schedule - - - and it was only when it was charging that the batteries that would produce the smell - that is why I was never able to smell it. . .

Now I have to check the batteries on a few dozen of these units and get replacements - - - this was not budgeted for this year!!!",talesfromtechsupport

In honor of Halloween coming up, I thought I'd share the scariest tech support story I have. It's 100 percent true and is my favorite story to tell my end users around this time of year. I still get chills thinking about it.

\-----------------------------

Background: It's early in my career and I've started working at a help desk. One of my friends is a nanny for a couple and she invites me to get coffee because she has a scary story and doesn't know who else to tell. Names have been changed.. aside from Rupert.

Me: HelpMeAssistYou

Lisa: Nanny and Friend

M: Mother of the children she cares for

D: Older daughter, 4 years old

NS: Newborn Son

\------------------------------

After getting our coffee we sit down.

Me: So, what's this story you have for me? You sounded pretty shaken up.

Lisa: Well, yesterday I was taking care of D and NS and D went down for her nap. When I walked by her room to check on her, she was singing, ""Blood, blood from the baby, it's okay he wanted to play. Blood blood from our mommy, that's okay she died today.""

Me: \*wide eyes\* What... the fuck?

Lisa: I KNOW. So, I sat her down and asked her where she learned that song and she said she learned it from her imaginary friend, Rupert. She said he talks to her sometimes and they sing together, mostly at night.

Me: That's insane.

Lisa: I know, so I asked M about it and she said that D has been saying that for a while and that Rupert has been apparently trying to get her to get up in the middle of the night, go to NS's room and get him out of the crib to be in her room.

Me: How long has this been going on?

Lisa: Ever since they brought the baby home. There's no way she could have learned that unless someone told her. Her parents don't watch anything that would trigger that and she's very well sheltered.

Me: \*After leaning back and thinking for a while\* Wait... Oh fuck.

Lisa: What?

Me: When they brought him home, did they buy new baby monitors?

Yes. That was it. We called the family and had them check it out. The monitors didn't record, but they could move and also have audio output. They waited until night, then stood outside the daughter's door until they heard a man talk over the monitors and start singing to her. Immediately, they unplugged them and called the police, but there was nothing that they could do to trace the guy. I walked them through two-step authentication on Nest units after that and Rupert hasn't come back. Fucking sickos, man.

Buddy needs a password reset.  Simple call, NBD 2 minutes and it's done.  But oh no.

The whole thing starts when the password I sent doesn't work.  I figured maybe I'd fat-fingered it so I reset it again to the same thing.  Still no dice.  Guess I have to figure out what's going on over there.  Sounds like a PEBCAK to me.


###Chapter 1: Trying to get the computer name

So the user doesn't have the standard bginfo wallpaper and his PC name isn't showing there.  No biggy, right?  So I get him to right-click the start menu and click system.

Nope.  The ""System"" choice isn't there...  He's got two totally different choices instead.  No idea what the hell he's clicking on.  Figured I'd try to guild the call a bit further.

**Me**: Okay, maybe you're on one of the legacy systems.  Is your start button a circle, or a flat square with the windows logo?  
**User**: Oh, I guess it's a circle.

**Me**: Ok, no prob - left-click the start button and click on ""Computer"" on the right-hand side of the screen  
**User**: Hmmm... um... nope, not seeing it there.

Mother of god damn fucks... here we go!

**Me**: Okay, so there's another way we can find this.  Left click the start menu to bring it back up again.  Then type in ""CMD"" like ""Charlie Mike Delta"" and hit enter.  
**User**: Okay.  I have a black box on my screen.  
**Me**: Okay, perfect.  Now, type the percent sign, then 'computername' as all one word, then another percent sign  
**User**: Hmm, not following you.  I don't see any percent sign there?  
**Me**: No, you need to type that in.  It isn't on the screen.
**User**: Oh.  
**Me**:  Okay, start with the percent sign.  Shift-5 to enter it in.  
**User**: Okay, percent.  Enter.  'percent' is not recognized as an internal or external command...  
[**Mentally**: Are you FUCKING kidding me right now!?]  
**Me**: No no, percent, computername, percent.  
**User**: computername percent.  'percent' is not recognized as an internal or external command...  
**Me**: No.  Type in ""Computername"" as one word, but sandwich it between percent signs.  One on each side.  
**User**: I'm not following  
**Me**: Okay, I'll email you what to put in.  [emails user a 1-liner `%computername%`]
**User**: [computer name] is not...


Fucking hallelujah!

###Chapter 2: Champ Boogaloo

So I connect on, and I shit you not, the user was literally typing ""percent"" the first few times.  Despite me saying ""shift-5"".  Despite me saying ""percent computername percent"".  Ho my gah.

Also, the user was on Windows 10 - so we can also safely confirm he can't distinguish a square from a circle...

###Chapter 3: How is computer used?

So here we are - finally at what I've been after.  I take the user over to the system to see what's going on.  Sure enough, user types in a password, and the system doesn't take it.

I get him to type it in again and notice he's only typing in maybe half of the number of characters in the password... so I go to his email... and there's a bunch of unread emails - one of which being the password email I sent him.

**Me**: Are you sure you're entering in the password from the email?  
**User**: Yes, and it's not working  
**Me**: ...What are you entering?  
**User**: H-e-l-l-o  
**Me**: You're literally just typing in the first word from the email as seen in the summary.  You need to open the email to see the password I set.

[**Mentally:** Jesus mother of fucks, how the fuck is somebody this dense.  It's 2019.  HOW!!??  How do you manage to even make it through a standard day!?]

Sure enough, the user was able to get in after using the right password.


What a fucking waste of 20 minutes.  Thank god I'm paid by the hour.


Why not start all job interviews off with a very basic technology competency test?  It's 2019.  This shit should be common sense.  Things like knowing what the fuck a start button is, or how to follow instructions.  gah!",talesfromtechsupport

I was finally returning to my little cubicle from being AWOL for two weeks on unpaid sick leave, so my I was happy to finally be coming back to work and making money again. Sit down, plug in, insta call.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Thank you for calling \*IP\* my name is Daemonik, how can I help you today?

User: FINALLY! My phone wont connect to the internet.

Me (internally): Oh great, I get to start off with an easy one, reset router/check wifi turned on, next call right?

Me (out loud): Alright no problem, lets get you online. Can you please check your wifi settings on your phone? Is it connected or still searching for the network? 

User: It can't find the network

Me: Alright, can you look at your internet box and tell me if there are any lights on? Are any of them blinking?

User: All the lights are on solid

Me: Alright, can you please unplug it and leave it out for 10s, then plug it back in.

User: But it's wireless!

Me:...

\*Some of you may have noticed something glaringly obvious and odd here. How are the lights on if there's no power? Don't worry, that's not the end of this, in fact, this is where the story goes downhill REAL quick\*

Me: Unfortunately the wireless portion of that internet box is referring to how the internet gets to your phone, you still need a cable to power the machine. 

User: But...I'd have to take it out of the box for that!

Me: \*mute\* Headdesk \*unmute\* Yes ma'am you will need to take the internet box out of the packaging.

User: I can't do that, I'm driving right now!

Me (internally): There goes my customer satisfaction rating. (We had a policy that if a customer called back in 3 days, yo got a automatic 0% for that call).

Me (out loud): Yes ma'am, once you get home give us a call back we will walk you through the process. \*Click\*

t3_dfm0j7,That's not how you disconnect a VGA cable.,"I know this is long, but it is worth the read.

&amp;#x200B;

What seems like a lifetime ago, I worked for a small point-to-point fixed wireless ISP. We'd go to a customer site and install a fixed antenna that pointed to a node of our network of wireless towers. I was combination sysadmin, repair tech, and field tech. I \*loved\* that job. I would probably still be there if the company hadn't been sold. 

&amp;#x200B;

I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

One day a guy brought in a computer from a well known company that rhymes with smell. The computer was in a commodity style case. I don't remember the model. The customer was complaining that the computer couldn't connect to the monitor. I was assigned the case and I started to hook up the machine. Since I knew the layout pretty well, I wasn't really paying attention to the ports, just plugging them in half by memory. When I got to the VGA port, I saw the problem -- the guy had RIPPED OUT the VGA port from the motherboard! All that was there was a few of the traces that went to the pins on the connector. The connector was just GONE. My guess is that the thumb screws were tight and when it wouldn't come out easily, he resorted to yanking on it.

&amp;#x200B;

It did have a PCIe x16 port, but since there was onboard VGA, I would have to disable the onboard, in the BIOS that I couldn't get to, before I could plug in a third party card. I tried anyway, but to no avail. I know there are cards that will allow you to see the BIOS post over a serial terminal, but we didn't have one of those.

&amp;#x200B;

I called the customer and, trying to professional, I explained that we couldn't repair this and that the motherboard would have to be replaced. Since all the other components appeared to be in good shape, I offered him a choice. 1. We could get a third-party board for a good price that would do very well and accept all of the remaining components and would fit in the case. 2. We could order a motherboard from Smell for that model and wait for it to come in. It would take a while and would probably cost three times as much.

&amp;#x200B;

The customer insisted that he have the Smell despite my gentle coaxing toward option 1. So I got out my company credit card and called Smell.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Here is what happened. (I regale him.) I do not need to go through the steps. I am an IT professional with 20+ years experience. I know what the problem is. I just need to order a new motherboard.

&amp;#x200B;

FTSP: Have you tried rebooting it?

&amp;#x200B;

Me: No, as I said the VGA port has been ripped from the motherboard. I just need to order a motherboard.

&amp;#x200B;

FTSP: Is it plugged in?

&amp;#x200B;

Me: There is no need to check these things. I know the problem: the VGA port has been forcibly removed from the motherboard. I need to order a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

FTSP: Is the VGA cable plugged in?

&amp;#x200B;

TTSP: Have you checked to see if it is plugged in?

&amp;#x200B;

Me: (Quite impatient now.) Listen. I DON'T NEED DIAGNOSTICS. I NEED TO PURCHASE A MOTHERBOARD. 

&amp;#x200B;

TTSP: Of course sir. I can help you with that. What is the model number?

&amp;#x200B;

Finally! After about an hour on the phone, someone is finally about to help me. I give the model number.

&amp;#x200B;

TTSP: Standy by while I look up the system. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Ok. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few minutes later.....

&amp;#x200B;

TTSP: Thanks for waiting, sir. Unfortunately, I can't sell you a motherboard for that model. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: (??????) What?

&amp;#x200B;

TTSP: I can't sell you a motherboard for that model without approval from my manager. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Why? I have a credit card in my hand! Just put in the order.

&amp;#x200B;

TTSP: I'm sorry sir. I need to get approval.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Ok. Get the approval.

&amp;#x200B;

TTSP: My manager has left for the day. He'll be in tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

It bears explaining that this is on a Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Ok. When he comes in tomorrow, get the approval and call my company cell phone. Here's the number. I don't care that it is a Saturday. Call me so that I can order this motherboard.

&amp;#x200B;

TTSP: Of course sir. Is there anything else I can help you with?

&amp;#x200B;

Me: (Trying not to growl) No. Thank you. 

&amp;#x200B;

TTSP: Thank you for calling Smell. Have a great day.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I tell my boss the whole story, in short because he heard most of it. He explains that they can't sell me a motherboard without approval because if a warranty claim comes in for the system and they don't have a motherboard for it, they will be on the hook for a new system.

&amp;#x200B;

(EyeRoll) This system was a few years old. Any warranty from the factory would have long been expired. Since most people don't tend to order the extended contracts, the likelihood of a warranty claim coming in was low. Still I would have to wait.

&amp;#x200B;

Saturday comes and goes. No call.

&amp;#x200B;

Sunday comes and goes. No call.

&amp;#x200B;

Monday comes and finally someone calls me about noon or so.

&amp;#x200B;

TTSP: Thanks for you patience. I can now take your order.  &gt;:-( 

&amp;#x200B;

To sum up: I order the motherboard. As predicted, it is about three times the price of a third-party motherboard. It takes about a week for it to get to me. I switch everything over, test the system and call the customer who comes and pays and leaves with his machine.

&amp;#x200B;

There are just some people who should \*never\* be allowed to use a computer.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

&amp;#x200B;

Customer with more strength than brains rips the VGA port from the motherboard and wants to pay through the nose for a replacement part, even though there are less expensive options. The manufacturer doesn't want to sell me the item for fear of not having supply on had for a warranty claim that won't happen. After getting approval from the manufacturer, I am able to order the part, fix the machine and return it to the customer.

&amp;#x200B;

That motherboard has a permanent place on the wall of shame.",talesfromtechsupport

&amp;nbsp;

So we recently hired two new web developers, one of them sends in a ticket on like day 2, as follows:

OWD: Why are there these icons on my desktop? I don't want them there, I don't even use them! When I delete them they just come back! They're distracting and keeping me from doing my JOB!!!

SU: Those are a part of your department's group policy, just move them out of the way and ignore them if you don't use them. Closing ticket.

&amp;nbsp;

Time passes, my supervisor leaves and now I am the one who knocks

&amp;nbsp;

OWD: What the hell is ""group policy"" and how does it help me do my job! I want these icons gone! They're distracting!

Me: Hello OWD! *explains what group policy is in a friendly and helpful manner.* So unfortunately there's nothing I can do for you other than what SU suggested, however... If you'd like I can escalate to... the SYSTEM ADMIN. 

Now I am not normally such a petty man but the ""what the hell is gRoUp PoLIcY"" comment really sparked my ire for this unfortunate soul.

OWD: Yes, I would like that.

Me: *shrugs, moves ticket to sysadmin queue*

The sysadmin is a busy man and does not care to be bothered by such things. After a couple of days letting it marinate, OWD sends *another* ticket in for the same thing. SA sees it and instead of replying, he calls OWD.

SA: Hi OWD, would you be able to come to the IT office so we can discuss your, uh, tickets? Great, thanks.

(Just a minor note, but OWD is in a building across the street and about a block down the road, so he has to hoof it all the way here)

OWD goes into SA's office and the door shuts. I hear very little except for snippits of ""wasting our time"" and ""used by your department"" and ""move them out of the way"".

OWD comes out a few minutes later, head down, looking both upset and humbled, and quickly leaves.

SA: close his tickets, the issue is resolved.

t3_dfkza5,I have a yellow one,"Every 6 months or so I get asked for the story about my flair and usually just post a TL;DR in the comments. Today's the day I release the full monty. Please bear in mind that this happened over a decade ago, so the dialog has been changed to infect the innocent.

Once upon a time, there was a (now defunct) national photography company that rented space in another (nearly defunct) retail company. Let's call them DeathGlance and KD Nickles respectively. Although it could just as eaqually have been called Roland Hills and J\*Mark. I'll leave the decision up to you.

This photography company hired and trained ""professsional"" photographers from the same general pool of college-age kids and empty-nesters as the retail store, so you can only imagine the level of technical aptitude.

Said photography company also had a problem. Their robotic camera system was approaching year 12 of a 5-year projected lifespan and broke down constantly. To staff enough traveling repairpeople to service the dying cameras would be too expensive to make what little profit margin remained in an industry that was already circling the drain. Their solution: Push all but the largest repair tasks on the photographers.

Now to be fair, this system was exceptionally well designed, and was awarded several patents back in its heyday. Most of the repairs that had to be done were no more involved than swapping out a controller box with an idiotproof connector, or occasionally having to lift a 20 pound camera and detach it from its mount.

t3_dfk8mg,"One Switch, Two Switch, Mold Switch, Whose Switch?","&gt;**Dr. Seuss:** Hey guys, the network's down at $TooCoolForSchool and we have testing in the morning, can someone please check it out asap?  
  
Poor, poor $2C4S. The demigods of luck have been fickle with them; most recently the crazy summer rains caused water damage that turned to mold in a section of the building that wasn't used over the summer, so bye bye switch. I was suspecting that as the actual cause as I knocked on the door and Dr. Seuss let me in.  
Sure enough, the closet was doing its best blinkenlights. We'd had more than one client pull a ""plug both ports on an IP phone into the wall"", in some cases multiple times, so I started from the firewall and worked my way down as I talked.  
Dr. Seuss physically confirmed no one had done such a thing - and blessedly, is one of those unicorns that's just tech savvy enough *and* sensible enough to know their limitations that I could trust them. But several ports, linked to parts unknown, were crashing the network as soon as they were plugged in. And unfortunately, because of $Reasons, we did not have credentials to the switches, so I couldn't track down the culprit logically either. We were able to at least get partial connectivity and I promised to send someone their way in the morning.  
  
I discussed it the next day with Graybeard, their lead tech. My theory was either the mold had gone sentient or lightning had claimed another victim - just that past week we'd had three switches and a firewall fritz and die because of it. Graybeard was sticking to the loopback theory - he suspected a couple of 5-port switches in labs as the culprits. But both were going to require some legwork, so he recruited the bright-eyed intern HK-47, and ~~slew the seven daemons to reclaim the Thrice-Stolen Sword of Directional Input~~ found a cable toner. I wished him luck and returned to my normal duties.  
  
Graybeard called me later that day, laughing. Not quite ""ha-ha funny"" laughing.  
You see, because of aforementioned $Reasons, we had not done the cabling for much of the school, nor our usual vendor. And one of the summer projects had been adding new APs, of a particular brand that has two ports on the back. Whatever walnuts did the cabling, looked at the two ports, decided they were equal and ran two lines to each AP.  
Not only that, but just prior to the weekend, we had done an update of the controller and firmware for said APs. Which apparently changed the default behavior of said APs for handling their ports...  
In short, upon rebooting, each AP decided it was a switch and that newfangled STP wasn't worth it, thank you kindly.  
  
Graybeard took the expedient solution, and unplugged half of the new ports. Connectivity was restored and students were plagued with tests once more.

We have a print shop as a customer.  They make posters, booklets, stationary, etc.  We get a call from one of them, similar to the following:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;C: Hey, our Graphics workstation isnt turning on

This computer is an older G5 Powermac (the tower version).  At this point, this machine is probably 4-5 years old.  I walk through all the standard stuff, make sure cords are plugged in, etc, monitor, power strip on, everything seems OK.  We send someone out there, and as near as we can tell, the machine is dead.  They asked us to bring the machine back to the office and see if we can get any  data off of the drives.  We do, bring it back, and following some diagnostic procedure plug the machine in to see if there's fan spin or any indicators of life.  Turn it on, comes on and boots with no issue.  We did discover the machine was almost unusably slow (word took 15+min to launch), but that was another issue entirely.  

We call, tell them it's working, and bring it back.  Hook it up, it's dead again.  At this point, we're getting really frustrated, and take the machine to another outlet, plug it in, and it works fine.  What the hell?  We plug in a fan at the outlet the machine originally used, it works fine with no issue.  Go take another computer, hook it up there, boots with no issue.  Bring the Mac back there, refuses to turn on.

t3_dfb8k5,1U Jet Engine,"For context: I work at a small IT MSP employing about 7 people, even with our small size projects tend to get siloed to certain people and I occasionally get thrown into the mix when a big hardware install needs to happen since I have the most familiarity with the physical stuff.

I come into the office and before I've even logged in I'm handed a 1U dell r420 and told I'll need to drive to a client about 60 miles away and install it as a temporary loaner server, this client in particular works in a specialized field where they need enterprise IT gear but there's only about 3 people at the company and it's a home office. I'm given this 1U server and told to go install it, configure it with a static IP, and let our outsourced engineer team know the IP so they can remote in. I head out there and set it up and the second I turn it on the fans ramp up to take off speeds, briefly come back down as Windows starts loading, and then immediately ramp back up and stay pinned at that level. Now normally this wouldn't be a *huge* deal but this server was going in the client's office. I'm standing there giving it the stink eye when the client walks into the room and yells to me over the incredible racket ""is it going to do this all the time?"".

Now, I had heard this thing from the basement in the office but I just figured they were running prime95 on it or something to stress test it. 1U servers tend to be on the noisy side but they shouldn't be hearing protection loud when sitting idle at the desktop. Confused, I fire up open hardware manager to find that processor 0 is at 95 degrees basically always and processor 1 is sitting at 20. Clearly something's wrong, maybe the chip is reporting it's temp wrong? I decide to shut it down and take a look to see if I can see anything funky inside the machine. I pop open the cover to the server and carefully touch my finger to the heatsink for processor 0 and it's ice cold, not only that but it moves a little when I do it. Now, given that we've deployed this server before it took me a second to connect the dots that a heatsink shouldn't do that. I poke it again and it's wobbling around. Taking the shroud off I grab the heatsink and am able to lift it entirely off the board, it isn't even screwed down. Low and behold on the bottom of it is one of those perfectly sized squares of machine applied thermal paste that the heat-sinks come with. 

I'm not talking ""oh there was some left over thermal paste on it"" no, it was a from-the-manufacturer machine applied square of it. The processor, of course, was totally clean. No tale-tale stains or anything. Somehow Dell had QC passed this server, shipped it to us, and we had deployed it in the past with the heat sink just kind of set over the processor, no actual contact. Somehow between Intel's thermal throttling and the fans pushing enough air over the bare heatspreader it had managed to not die. 

In total disbelief I fetched my screwdriver and for the first time in this R420's life actually fully installed the heatsink for processor 0 and upon firing it up what do you know it's idling at 35 now and the fans don't sound like they're from pratt and whitney anymore.

I want to point out, this server was sitting in our basement like this whining away as we installed 1tb ssds, had it build a small raid array, fresh installed server 2016, and set up various bits of software on it **for the better part of last week**.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_df04j0,Tech support failure in the making...,"I'm not really in a tech support role at my job, but I know this really amazing trick where you google error messages and follow instructions to fix problems, so I'm the go-to person whenever something isn't working.

I recently put in my notice and they decided not to replace me, so I'm training one of my coworkers to take over some of my workload. Like me, this coworker doesn't have a background in IT, but unlike me I don't think she's willing to put in the work and learn the minimal amount of things she needs to know to get by.

I've already told my manager (via email, cc'd to multiple people so my ass is covered) that I don't think she's a good fit and they should hire someone else for this role. They refuse to take my advice, but hey at least I get some funny stories for the internet.

Last week I walked this coworker through one of our processes: upload an excel file to our company website and generate various reports. It's really simple stuff but many employees struggle with this system so I wanted her to get familiar with it and all possible issues that might arise, since she will be tasked with helping users.

After I've shown her an example, I tell her to try creating an excel file and go through the process on her own. I leave for 5 minutes and when I come back she immediately calls me over and says it's not working.

Me: It's fine to take some time to figure it out, I'd rather you try to do it on your own first.

Coworker: No, I did it exactly as you showed me, come and have a look.

Me: Is there an error message? Maybe you can try figuring it out.

Coworker: I already tried 10 times and it's not working.

She insists until I go over and look at her computer screen. Immediately I see a red error message on the page that says ""maximum filesize (100MB) exceeded"".

Me: So, as it says here, the problem is that the file is too big.

Coworker: It's not possible, it can't be that big, I don't know its size but I'm sure it's much much smaller.

Me: Let's check the size of the file. \[We check. Looooong pause.\] I had no idea you could even make excel files that big... This file is 1.5GB...

Coworker: Yes like I said, it's smaller than 100!

Me: 1.5GB is... bigger than 100MB...

t3_df06ce,Infinite Loops are Edge Cases?,"This is a request from another thread.  I posted an anecdote about a Twitter bot run by a company I used to work for, and was asked to make a full post out of it.

So here goes...

At the time, I was working as a NOC tech for a company known for math software.  They run a Twitter bot where you can submit code snippets by tagging the bot, and the bot will parse the code, render a graphical result, and post it back to Twitter.  It's a neat little tech demo for the product.

The bot lived on a VM in the production environment, and the guest didn't have a lot of resources allocated; it didn't see too much traffic, so even though it was doing some potentially computationally-intensive work (3D graphics were a very common thing to render), it wasn't in use enough to warrant a lot of allocation.

The code for the bot was also a bit on the rough side.  Its logging was particularly noteworthy; it logged all activity - without timestamps - to a single file, and had no rotation set up, either on the application or OS level.  It also didn't have any checks in place as to who it was replying to; there was a moderation team responsible for removing the occasional troll post where people would tweet to it with offensive usernames, or similar.  There was also a problem with the bot replying to itself; if you included the bot's name in the message, the rendered result would be picked up by the bot and queued for another reply.  We had discovered this by accident, and the developer said that it wasn't a big deal (big mistake).

Despite all of that, it worked well enough, and was spotlighted sometimes by news articles, and the occasional contest run by the marketing department.

Well, one day, the marketing department went to drum up some publicity, and posted a tweet from the main company account, tagging the bot's account.  Then they send a follow-up tweet from the bot's account, quoting the original reply.

This results in a tweet with two mentions of the bot's name.

And this goes about as well as you might expect, for not-polished code without proper error checking.

The bot fires off a response to itself, rendering the result. Which triggers a response, and another render, and... well, you get the idea.

The guest VM running the bot, having never been provisioned for this kind of capacity (rendering several tweets every second), goes absolutely haywire.  It maxes the CPU and memory consumption quickly, which starts to generate errors.  The single (very large, at this point - on the order of several GB) log file starts to bloat.  And the VM environment starts to hang because of all of the traffic (it wasn't designed to handle that kind of I/O).

Thankfully, we managed to kill (almost literally; Force Stop and the VM's disk ended up moderately corrupted because of it) the VM guest before it got too out-of-hand.  And Twitter actually suspended the bot, which also put a stop to it.

A poor intern still ended up having to delete - by hand! - several thousand tweets.  It took them a few days.

The bot developer, meanwhile, learned a valuable lesson about what constitutes an ""edge case"" (and why you don't ignore them).  And ""error handling""...",talesfromtechsupport
t3_df0js5,"Typing your own password is hard, even if you do it every day","I work for a relatively big manufacturing company in IT, and we are just doing a software rollout of our SAP solution to an eastern European country. Me and a colleague from the business side of things are currently on site there, watching over users try to work with the new system after weeks of training, testing, and a generally successful GoLive last week.

Today I was trying to add an iPhone app to one of our technicians phones where he can see his daily work load (which customers at what time etc) without booting his laptop, so it can be seen in the car and used for navigation. This app needs the normal Active Directory username and password. I ""install"" the web app to his phone, and ask him to log in. He takes a piece of paper and notes down his password and hands it to me, but I tell him no and ask him to just do it himself. He types it in, and the password popup just comes again. He tries several times, and I watch him. He types it in correctly as written on his note. I ask him if all letters are always in lowercase as he is typing them, feeling bad for asking such as stupid, almost insulting question, but he insists they are indeed lowercase.

I try to get feedback from out AD guys, if there are failed login error messages in some logs, etc., but didn't reach anybody due to lunch time etc.

t3_df220w,Is it turned on?,"I work for my local city, and we have City Council Meetings twice a month.  The room is set up with a projector, and microphones for the Elected Officials and Company up atop a dais.  There is a podium centered in front of them below, and a desk off to the side for a laptop feed to the projector.  Whatever engineer designed this system thought having the control box inside of the podium was a good idea.  All of the microphones and VGA feeds go to that, instead of the closet with the rest of the equipment.  If the Podium isn't plugged up, half the things won't work.

&amp;#x200B;

Right as I go on vacation, they have budget meetings in the room and disconnect the podium.  Our maintenance guy did this (like usual) and I'm assuming he's the one that hooked it back up.

My boss expects the console in the podium to be out and has scheduled an emergency tech call from a local A/V company to get it back up before tomorrow's meeting.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing it's likely a simple fix, I head into work (5minutes from home) at 11pm that night to take a look.  Instantly look at the floor box and see that the cable labeled ""VGA In"", is plugged into the ""VGA Out"" plug.  Laptop feed roars to life on the projector.  See that the microphones are not muted and walk to the closet.  The amplifier at the bottom of the hanging rack cabinet is flipped Off.  Flip it back to On, and everything is back to working.  The system is controlled by either of 2 tablets to turn on/off everything, so no one should ever be turning things off in that cabinet.

t3_df0lm5,USB vs RJ45 = clueless IT,"Hi TFTS, this is a tale about a $School I remember going to.

It isn't the same $School as last time. It has about 1000 students, proper IT, Azure AD, Office 365... lots of stuff.

Cast:

$Teacher: a good teacher of Music. Doesn't click all buttons he finds, doesn't unplug random cables because they're ugly, doesn't think that the network fix you did broke the mouse, respects that IT is just better with computers. Recently moved classrooms, now he's in the most isolated room of the entire school. No wifi, only an ethernet port. But at least he got a printer of his own...

$Me: a person (student) with some technical skills, no admin privileges, no knowledge of the network, no employment contract, but is known as 'the guy that fixes computers'.

Story:

I get into class with this teacher and the subject starts. When we get into a more open section of the class, where we learn different musical instruments by ourselves (with assistance from $Teacher), he just casually mentions:

$Teacher: Oh, just by the way, my printer's broken, $Me. You can look at it if you want, but I doubt that you'll be able to do much; IT came down here and they didn't know what to do with it either, so if you want to look...

$Me: (in my head) Well that doesn't mean a whole lot. (to $Teacher) Alright, I'll see what I can do.

I come to the PC and get a more detailed description of the symptoms.

$Teacher: It says it's offline, and when I print to it, it just... doesn't print. That's been happening since the friday a week ago. IT added this other printer for me, but it's a 5 minute walk away, and that's just a pain.

$Me: Yeah, I can imagine.

I confirm the symptoms (14 print jobs pending...) and check that the printer is on. I print a test page to it, nothing. Drivers are working, and another (networked) printer using the same driver works. I reboot the printer. It starts up fine, I can even open the settings. I glance at the back and see a USB cable going to the PC (this printer is a network printer, but $School is using USB for it. I knew that, as I helped move the printer 2 weeks ago).

$Me: Alright, I'll try switching the USB port the printer is using.

I plug the printer into a different port, but nothing.

Wait, what? Nothing? Not even a ding to indicate a new device being plugged in?

$Me: Looks like something's wrong inside the printer which is preventing the USB port from working. But it supports the network, it even has Wifi written on it so... it should support the network. I'll see about the ethernet port...

I look closely behind the printer and see a Wifi logo on a sticker. Under it lies a USB port, presumably for a Wifi dongle. So much for wireless. Looking at the Ethernet port...

$Me: Wait, that's... no way.

I unplug the network cable from the ethernet port. And find a USB B connector. Apparently, the USB cable from earlier was plugged into the ethernet port. With my glance, all I saw was a cable, not the connector. To my surprise, it actually fits pretty well in there. I plugged it into the USB port and the printer came to life.

$Teacher: Oh uh, probably cancel that, there's a few print jobs, one of which has about 100 pages.

I cancel the current printjob from the printer, take out the cable, cancel the other print jobs from the PC (about 130 pages in total, but that's not unexpected for this school and subject) and plug it back in.

It reminded me how the day before, I tried to force a Displayport cable into an ethernet port.

Tying up some loose ends:

Who did this one? I'm guessing some kids from the school.

Why did they not find out? I heard from the teacher that they only checked the software on the PC after the lesson. Yeah, that's stupid but...

This lady apparently had two boxes, one for her modem, and one for her router is what I assumed. I'm not her ISP and have no knowledge of her in-home setup, and... surprise surprise, neither does she. We got the computer powered down, the printer unplugged, but she isn't sure which box to unplug for the router.

OK, kind of a pain but I can see what we have to work with. Called the guy up and eventually got in contact with someone from the streaming service, whitelisted a domain on the web filter and ensured a port was open for streaming on the firewall. Good enough right? I went on to also take a picture of the switch in the press box on the football field and I highlighted which ports to use if live streaming (other ports were reserved for other VLANs).


So $angryDude shows up to live stream and he tests it out, works great! Mission accomplished, I'm going to grab my kid and get some groceries, etc.... On the road he calls back and says nothing is working now. Ok great.... can you reboot? He refuses. I ask him to make sure the ports are plugged in correctly or if anything got unplugged on the switch to which he responds ""why would anyone unplug that important looking stuff?"".


So long story short, I drive back to the school and we eventually reboot his streaming encoder and things work. OK good. Going home, again....

Me = me, EA = boss's Executive Assistant

&amp;#x200B;

I used to provide support for a hedge fund. While the company had some big accounts, the office itself was pretty small (5 people). However, given the amount of money at stake, they couldn't afford to be down for a second, and they ran into plenty of (relatively minor) issues on a daily basis. That's why they needed a full time IT/tech support person.

&amp;#x200B;

When I started there, they had severely outdated machines and equipment. After the fund managers complained enough, I finally convinced the owner (a fight you to the death over a nickel kind of guy) to upgrade the workstations. The fund managers' machines were updated by a certain financial/news/software/data company which may have been started by a now former mayor because we had a contract with that company. The new contract included new(ish) machines for the fund guys. I also installed some extra memory we purchased on our own because 128 MB, seriously? Granted, this was Windows XP, but 128 MB was still just barely the recommended, and they couldn't open more than one Excel sheet while the financial data app was running. A minor purchase to upgrade to 512 MB, and the managers were pleased as could be.

&amp;#x200B;

Along with the new fund managers' machines, we ordered some workstations on the cheap for myself and the EA when the new tech was coming out. Gotta love those clearance sales. This was all done while the boss's EA was on vacation. I had moved over her accounts, files, etc., so she would have a seamless transition when she returned...or so I thought. When she got back, she called me over and started screaming that her oven was missing.

&amp;#x200B;

EA: My oven is gone! Put it back! I need it!

Me: What oven? We don't even have a kitchen in this office.

EA: My oven! The one I use to warm up my lunch!

Me (confused): I don't know what you are talking about.

Then she started pointing at the monitor and shouting, ""MY OVEN! MY OVEN! MY OVEN!""

&amp;#x200B;

I remembered how my cat liked to lay on my old monitor on my computer at home, and it finally dawned on me that she was referring to her old monitor. Along with the new workstations, we got new LCD monitors (as they were finally becoming affordable). She wanted her old CRT monitor back because it generated enough heat that she had been using it to warm up her lunch that she brought from home.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her the old equipment was gone, but she didn't like that answer. She made such a fuss that the boss came out to see what she was screaming about. When I explained the situation, he just rolled his eyes and walked off. He didn't even want to hear it.

Since there was nothing to be done about her monitor, I just showed her which folder(s) her files were in (as opposed to the file earthquake that she'd had on her previous desktop), and helped her get used to the new OS.

This story is from back in the iPhone 5 days, for some reason SIM cards have always been an enigma for some customers. 

This lady calls my store and complains that she’s having issues with her phone not getting signal, she’s quite agitated and understandably so if she’s not getting the service she paid for. So I run through a few basic troubleshooting steps to start figuring out the issue. I ask her to restart the phone and all that good jazz and check her V****** account to make sure everything is fine there and that she’s not actually past due. (Actually common to get people who haven’t paid their bill for 2-3 months get cut and then complain that they aren’t getting service.... like... what?)  Her account is fine so I ask her to go into field test to give me an accurate signal strength. Everything is fine and then she says something about her SIM card having storage issues or something along those lines. (Customers tend to call SD cards SIMs and vice versa while SIMs only hold your account information now and aren’t used to storage) I inform her as she has an iPhone that there’s no removable storage and that the SIM is only there for accessing the network, she then got another call and we got disconnected. 

She calls back 5 mins or so later from the phone saying it’s working but that something about her sim is popping up on the screen and she doesn’t think she has one. I tell her if she’s using the phone there has to be a sim in the device. She asks where it is and I tell her it’s in the SIM tray on the side, I hear her shuffling her phone and “OH YEA I SEE IT!”..... *Click* 

She removed it while on the phone with me which disconnected our call, and in the process she dropped the sim and couldn’t find it! Just when it all gets good, she then has to come to my store to get a replacement sim and asked to speak to my manager. I inform her I’m the owner and I ask what the issue is. She says it’s my fault she was without a phone because apparently I remotely stole her SIM or something, can’t remember what the exact insanity she was trying to pull was now but basically I comped her a replacement SIM but that wasn’t good enough to her. She finally got that that’s all I could do for her being it was beyond my as well as RedVs™ control and no one else anywhere would be giving her compensation and left.

Some further digging showed that we'd sent him multiple emails about this over the past month or so, but he never replied to any of them. 

Sent a Slack message to one of our supervisors before I respond, he tells me to hold off for a bit while he checks with the devs. Gets back to me within a few hours, gave me the go-ahead to send Jeff the standard ""we're still working on it, we're sorry it's taking so long, we'll get back to you when we can"" response. 

So I do that, with a couple words sprinkled in letting him know what contact info we do have for him, and to let us know ASAP if that contact info is incorrect (some people do have valid email addresses on file that simply haven't been updated in awhile and the emails are going to an inbox the person rarely checks anymore). Also tried to call, but the phone rang straight to a voicemail that hadn't been set up yet. 

I figure, fuck it, one day he'll call in raging and we'll have to tell him he needs to set up his goddamn voicemail like an intelligent human being, and I send off my email. Keep in mind that my reply to his case was sent to the email address he'd sent the case in on. 

With that done, I close the case and peek back into the queue. There's 5 cases all of a sudden from this guy titled ""STOP!!! PLEASE READ!!!"" Um, ok, looks like I hit an autoresponder. I open one up and take a look.

The message is just something along the lines of, ""Don't use this email, use THIS one instead to contact us!"" Which I thought was odd, seeing as the guy used this email address to contact us, but I just kinda shrugged and went to close them all out, thinking it was odd that there were five of them, but I figured that was  the end of it.

I clicked back over to the queue. There were now ten of those ""STOP!!! PLEASE READ!!"" cases. *Okay.* 

The managers have a Slack bot that pings them whenever a new case enters the queue. As soon as I sent off an email to that guy, that bot started going \*nuts\*. The cases were being created almost faster than the bot could keep up with. There would be between 3-5 new cases in the queue every few seconds. We couldn't even GET to our other clients' cases for how quickly these spam cases were being populated. 

We eventually figured out what was happening - basically, this guy had an autoresponder, which we knew. We have a lot of clients who leave their autoresponders on after submitting cases (god knows why), and it does create a new case in our queue. We have your standard ""your case is being reviewed"" autoresponder when a case is submitted. The problem here is that this guy's autoresponder was somehow creating an autoresponding clusterfuck as it communicated with ours that I still don't fully understand, causing cases to just keep getting made and responded to.

The Salesforce team turned off our autoresponder, which stopped the spam so it could be cleared out. I left a Slack message in our channel letting everyone know to please check the email Jeff is emailing in from if he comes back again. 

I don't know what they're going to do going forward, but I'm very tempted to respond to this guy's next ""why haven't I been contacted"" inquiry with ""Your email is cursed. Please advise.""

TL;DR: Client's email address creates an auto-responding feedback loop similar to having Google, Alexa, and Siri all talk to each other at the same time. Chaos ensues.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_de7osx,"Please scratch the gray stripe on your card, not too soft to not do anything, not too strong to erase the numbers.","My first job was at a call center overseas which worked with the biggest prepaid cellphone company in the USA at the time... (2004).
  
I got a call one day and the customer asked me how to top up the phone. I told him to go to a bodega and get a calling card for the specified company and for the amount he wanted.   
  
He lasted about 7 minutes with the clerk and finally told me he had the card. I told him to look in the back for a gray stripe and get a key or a coin and to scratch the stripe and to do it not too soft nor too strong. We struggled for 35 minutes trying to scratch it off to no avail.    
  
Asked the guy to change the card at the store and they did.  
  
After a while I called IT Support and the first thing the guy tells me is: ""did you ask the customer to remove the card from the plastic envelope?""  
  
I came back to the call and asked the customer if indeed had he not removed the card from the plastic cover. The customer remained silent for a couple of seconds and said ""I'm so sorry I'm very stupid"", and hung up.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_de63do,Are you sure that’s your hard drive?,"A bit of a shorter one that definitely belongs here. 

I do PC repairs and refurbish/resell off lease machines in addition to cell phone/tablet sales/repair for a living. Had a woman come in my store a couple years back who seemed to know what she was talking about. She informed me that her HDD was failing and starting to make the amazing click noise we all know and absolutely love. (Sarcasm) 

She asks if we do data recovery and I let her know we do and i ask her if she can bring her drive in sometime to diag; she says she can and that she’ll be in the next day. 

I totally forget by the next day because my brain is amazing like that and she suddenly shows up asking to start a data recovery job. I let her know my techs are free right then and we can start immediately! She’s excited and agrees to the base diag fee (most repairs I offer are no fix no fee but these are time consuming so I charge a base of $35 to cover my techs time), I ask her for the drive and she goes out to her car to grab her bag containing the drive. 

A few moments go by as I’m helping another customer in line before she comes back in, producing a small bag when she gets to my tech bar. I start her account in my system, getting her basic contact details before I open the bag to get the drives S/N for her ticket... but find the complete PSU of her Tower inside instead. I ask her where the drive is and she says “That’s the drive right?? The box inside of the box??”.... 


This same woman just the day before actually sounded like she was about 2 levels above a “user”, while today she was just..... w0we.... 


She left to get the drive but never returned.... apparently the drive was too hard to find even though I told her she can bring the whole tower in if she has issues removing it.

t3_ddxce2,Clearly a secret agent,"A story on here just reminded me of a crazy customer I had. 
Was booking in his iPhone 6 for a screen repair and going through the motions. 
I go to create a repair ticket 

Me: so the iPhone 6 screen repair, that will be $x

Him: ok 

Me: now do you have a passcode on the phone? 

Him: ...yes 

Me: *waiting to type it in* what’s the passcode?

Him: why do I have to give you my passcode??

This is pretty typical complaint at this point, some people think we’ll steal their data or bank details or something but I assure him it’s for testing the touch on the screen after we put the new one on. I say sometimes you unfortunately get a faulty screen from the manufacturer (aka the dodgy supplier that the boss constantly gets ripped of by but I didn’t mention that ofc) and we don’t want to send him home with a faulty screen. 
Surprisingly, after a small back and forth he gives me his passcode and I enter it into the repair ticket. 
Now comes the next stage of booking in a repair. Because we have are in possession of a customers device, and for warranty, we need some basic info about them. 

Me: ok sir, almost done, I just need a couple of details then I can print you the repair ticket. What’s your first name? 

Him: *looks at me shocked* why do you need my name???

Me: oh because we have your device we need to keep track of who it belongs to, and also for the 6 month warranty we provide for the repair. All I need is a first and last name and a contact number.

He was suddenly fuming. Yelling about how he didn’t want us to know his name and that we could steal his identity. I assured him that we don’t sell any data to a third party (it’s a tiny business) but then he went on a rant about how our POS system was on the internet and could therefore be H4CK3D! I was trying not to laugh at this and grabbed my manager. 
My manager expertly calmed down the situation, booked in the repair, and our phone tech replaced the screen. 
Story over? Nah.

Guy comes back to pick up his phone and I’m on the front desk again. He says we’ve lied to him and wants to talk to the manager again. Turns out he’s been spending the whole last hour finding and reading through out terms of service (on a different phone, maybe his secret spy burner :o). There’s a section in there that refers to “customer data” - meaning ofc files and such from a device - and a bit where it says that such info must not be kept past the time of the active job and can be deleted on request of the customer (or something along those lines). 

Him: look see! It says here that you’re not allowed to keep my information! 

We explain what the rule is actually referring to and state once again that if he wants a warranty we need to keep his data on the system. 

Him: ok I don’t want a warranty. Delete all my info.

So we complied. There’s no record of him on our system. No record of the repair. Every record him scrubbed clean. Which means if anything goes wrong with his phone - not our problem. We never did the repair. 
The hilarious thing though - through this whole ordeal we had his phone. With his password. Lots more “identity compromising” data on there than a name and phone number. But who cares about some crazy guys data? Not us and not Russian hackers I can assure you. Possibly the police though.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ddl4op,Speaking to The Manager,"At a company I worked for more than 20 years ago, I would sometimes get customers who didn’t like what I told them, and demanded to speak to the manager. I’d transfer them, then a minute or two later he’d turn up at my workbench, ask me what the deal was, go back to the phone and tell the customer exactly what I’d told them, only now they’d be happy.

I imagine this is a near-universal experience for people who deal with customers in all sorts of industries, but one of my favourite customer interactions ever went a little differently.

I was on the phone with a customer (I no longer remember anything about him or what his issue was, other than probably broken hardware of some kind in his PC) and had been going round in circles for a while with him, thankfully in fairly civil fashion. Eventually I thought maybe inflicting the boss on him would help get him off my phone:

“Would you like to speak to The Manager?” I asked. 

After a pause, he said “No, no point”.

I’m thinking “huh?” and maybe this came across in the silence, because he followed up with:

t3_dd689c,How one smoke detector could have potentially killed 10 people.,"The story about how one smoke detector could have saved or potentiality killed 10 people.

I work as a tech at my local hospital, we have two offices that we work out of depending on what shift we're working (first shift works in the main office, second and third work out of our server room.) Being that it was a Saturday I was the only person in I.T there that day, so my office was completely empty except for me. As I'm doing my normal thing in our main office, like closing tickets and praying no one calls, I hear a ""code red"" get called over the intercom for the floor I'm on. Now, ""code red"" in our hospital means ""there's a fire, one person from each floor grab a fire extinguisher and get to that floor ASAP."" 

Our office takes up about half of the floor, the code red is called on the other side where all of the nurses are. Since there are 10 nurses working at a given time and I'm half a floor over I just ignore it and go back to what I'm doing. A minute or two passes and that ""code red"" gets updated to ""fire alert: Data Center."" At this point my head pops up like a meerkat and I let out a blood curdling ""HOLY SHIT!"" and I'm pretty sure I left a trail of visible light behind me as I cleared an entire floor in the matter of a few seconds. 

This was the case because I know that all nurse managers have a master key that can open up the doors to our server room. Now as I'm sure you are all aware, in a server room fire halon gas is released to suffocate the fire...and these ten people (who are unaware of this) are walking into this directly. 

As I make my way to the hallway where our server room is I see the door shut behind the last person going in. 

I open up the door to hear if the halon sirens are going off...and thankfully they were silent. The halon gas didn't get released and there was no fire in our server room (thank god.)

What happened was that we had a contractor installing rafters above our servers incase the floor above us would flood, the rafters would drain the water away from the servers and save them. What the genious didn't do was clean off the top of the servers. There were chunks of ceiling tile and enough dust to turn the black servers white. Enough dust was kicked up by the moving air to set off a smoke detector and trigger the code red.

Our halon gas gets released when two smoke detctors are triggered. Only one was set off in this major blunder. 

It was at this point when my boss came in that we realized that we don't have any procedures for when we have a server fire. Also what you have to take into account is that these nurses aren't bringing halon fire extinguishers as well, so they wernt doing us any favors by trying to put it out...

So you guys decide, was it one smoke detector that saved 10 people or was it one that could have killed 10 people?",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ddfdi5,The Great Friday Hack (The Beehive - Part 2),"You can read [Part 1](https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/da8z2l/the_friday_night_i_bricked_a_server_the_beehive/) to have context on the protagonists and what they're up to :

- _$me_ : He Who Is Cursed By The Last Day Of The Work Week, aka Sensei
- _$boss_ and _$pm_ : top brass managers at _$agency_
- _$kohai(1|2)_ : other devs under Sensei care
- _$queen_ and _$competentBee_ : workers of _$beehiveClient_
- _$beekeepers_ : shareholders of our client, looming threat on the project
- _$hostingProvider_ : _$wizardTechnician_ and _$salesTeam_ managing the machines used by _$beehiveClient_ 

-----

A few months had passed since the last fateful Friday, but I was still working in this project. But this Friday at 5pm no one at _$agency_ was at their desk.

There was a nation-wide sport event and we were enjoying our beers and ciders cheering whatever teams kicked the ball. Some of my colleagues were highly involved and wore the same clothes they had the last time their team won for superstitious reasons, I for one didn't care much but enjoyed the ambiance.

Phone rang and _$pm_ took the hit for us and grabbed the phone. I was about to throw my dart and show to _$kohai1_ that my dexterity was not only keyboard related when _$pm_ handed me the phone.

&gt; _$me_ : Sensei speaking.  
&gt; _$competentBee_ : Hi, I'm sorry but a client called us and said he couldn't order on _$bigEcommerceCmsInstance_, and that they were sure of the credit card they inputted.  
_\*Loud cheer on both side of the phone\*_  
&gt; _$competentBee_ : Yeah I guess you too would be AFK  
&gt; _$me_ : Let me not spill this cider on my computer and I'll double check what you're telling me.  

I put the phone down and launched my IDE and my trusty Firefox and spent 5 minutes checking all the orders on the backend : a few pending payments order, some already canceled and most are successful, nothing suspicious.

True to her nickame, _$competentBee_ already sent me the detail of the client's call with the user email, cart content and choice of shipping/payment method on our ticketing system.

As I'm mirroring the order on my side, _$kohai1_ sits down and asks how he can help us resume our dart game faster. I tell him to grab the ticket and do the same order as I'm doing and stop before payment.

While I'm not finding anything strange in the checkout, I'm grabbing the phone to tell _$competentBee_ that it could just be a fluke of _$user_ just having entered his credit card number wrong. But _$kohai1_ makes a funny face in front of his screen :

&gt; _$kohai1_ : Hey Sensei, are we supposed to enter the card info in the checkout directly? We're not redirected on _$bankUi_? I'm not familiar with _$beehiveClient_.

The unconscious shiver I had when hearing the words *credit card info inputted by $user* now comes full force and I check his screen : in lieu of a simple payment method selection pane with radio button and a Next button, he has a full credit card form asking for number, expiration date and CVV.

We always use payment methods that lets you enter your information on a bank website, never our own website. Even if PCI-DSS is not legally a requirement around here, it's known and most partners will tell you about it. 

Having this form only means one thing : **we've been hacked**.

In the upcoming weeks we'll learn that this is a common hack for our version of _$bigEcommerceCmsInstance_ and we're only one of many infected instances. But at this moment all I could think was the previous GDPR meeting with _$queen_ and the newly appointed bee overseeing Personal Identifying Information passing through all their infra and partners.

&gt; _$me_ : That was all the marketing software, exports and webservices that I know of for all instances of _$bigEcommerce_ and their different states. As said some account exists on each instance so you'll have duplicates on external software and reporting.  
&gt; _$queen_ : Can't we delete them on some instance? Do we need all this information?  
&gt; _$competentBee_ : Most of it is critical to our reporting to _$beekeepers_ and our marketing strategy, we need everything.  
&gt; _$sauronBee_ : We'll still need to give our users a way to delete their own account and information so this can't last.  
&gt; _$me_ : Yeah GDPR compliance is on our backlog, but _$bigEcommerceCms_ was not made with this in mind so it requires some work. Also you have multiple instances in various shade of old.  
&gt; _$sauronBee_ : Legal will have our neck if we're not compliant soon, implementing the cookie banner has not ease their fear one bit.  
&gt; _$queen_ : I'm sorry but marketing needs goes first, I've already told _$agency_ that we need to focus on quick wins for _$beekeepers_ and postpone all risky interventions.  
&gt; _$me_ : Remember that we didn't develop any of your website, nor are we hosting it. For now we're handling technical fixes and design requests to boost your marketing performance, but our audit showed a lot of things needing heavy changes that all can be done but gradually. I assume _$boss_ already told you anything out of that would require The Great Migration, _$queen_?  
&gt; _$queen_ : Yup I've heard but we're good for now, focus on the fixes.

While I already knew it in my heart, this was where I clearly understood that ""We'll do it later"" was the worst sentence a client can utter, for it can mean ""You'll do it for us at the least expected moment"" or ""it won't be done at all"", both equally scary perspective.

When you don't schedule maintenance, maintenance is scheduled for you. And now was the moment I had to look through the dozen patch I recommended installing in our audit.

----

I had to understand what happened first. We quickly found that the hack was javascript related and Chrome-specific, hence me not seeing it. While _$kohai1_ checked every site and found it on every instance, I was looking for the backdoor and suspicious activity.

Luckily I had buggered _$hostingProvider_ to give us access to all logs, and after a few minutes I found many attempts to access a malware script in a public folder.

But logs showed me 404 everywhere. Except I was watching only one of the machine : remember _$queen_ had asked for 2 machines and a load balancer. And sure enough, the second machine had all the attack scripts I saw as 404 previously. And these other logs showed multiple POST done to change some SQL values given the name of the script invoked. Yikes. And of course these posts dated back something like 2 weeks ago, without that call it could have been undetected for even longer. And I had no way of knowing how much SQL tampering had been done.

I replied to our ticket telling _$competentBee_ this seemed a security issue. I spent 20 minutes looking for the front-end exploit so I was expecting her call :

&gt; _$competentBee_ : we've checked on our side, it's everywhere!!  
&gt; _$me_ : Yeah I found their way in but can't find how the fraudulent form is attached.  
&gt; _$competentBee_ : How bad is it?  
&gt; _$me_ : I can't say yet, but it doesn't look good. The credit card skimming might only be the tip of the iceberg.  
&gt; _$competentBee_ : I have to tell Legal before we're sued to hell.  

The word ""lawsuit"" made me realize I wasn't paid enough to handle all of what I handle AND legal implications.

&gt; _$me_ : Listen, I'll brief both _$pm_ and _$boss_ and you do the same with _$queen_ and the highest IT people you can find and we schedule a call at 6.30pm. In the meantime I'll do my best to fix the issue.  
&gt; _$competentBee_ : Ok, call you later.

I have less than an hour to find a fix AND explain everything and what it means for our client and us as a company. There was potential for bankruptcy in my mind so I went after 5 minutes of thinking.

&gt; _$me_ : Some kind of script has been injected somewhere, shows the form for this payment method. A remotely accessible script aka webshell was installed and is now removed, but I don't know how it was uploaded to the server and what has been done/extracted. _$HostingProvider_ certainly could have done a better job and I fail to understand how we could have been bombed by requests and not kick the IP. I don't have a fix yet.  
&gt; _$boss_ : Ok, I've read your audit and the security chapter said some patch had to be installed.  
&gt; _$me_ : Yeah but first on preprod on each instance, then tested, and then deployed on both machine so with a bit of downtime. Why do you ask? I don't know which one could fix the hole in the hull.  
&gt; _$boss_ : What's the easiest one to install? The least risky in terms of breaking the site and block orders?  
&gt; _$me_ (a bit dumbfounded) : ...It won't fix anything...  
&gt; _$boss_ : It'll fix the fact we should have installed them in the first place. And give us breathing room during our talk with _$queen_  
&gt; _$me_ : But we already explained in the audit what it meant and why, and set priorities accordingly...  
&gt; _$boss_ : That's not what I want.  
&gt; _$me_ : Okay... I guess this one in the list do backend stuff so...  
&gt; _$boss_ : Install it right now. And check if the form is linked to the specific payment method, disable it if that's the case, people will use paypal for now.

I gotta give credit to _$boss_ for going 100% the bullshit way, and the intuition on the form being tied to the bank payment method. Disabling it fixed the issue for now, even if the script was still there and might have been collecting the address and phone number in the previous checkout step. I installed the patch so It'd look like we did something.

With only 5 minutes before the dreaded call with the bees, we had a semblance of a solution and blame-shifting facts to throw around in case of accusations. Both _$boss_ and _$pm_ are at the table with me and _$kohai1_ when an angel arrived :

&gt; _$youngDesignIntern_ : Hey Sensei, the table at _$favoriteDrinkingPlace_ is booked at you name right? How much people did you say and what hour? We're going now.

I almost forgot how tactful green people can be, and that we had whoever's victory to celebrate tonight. Coincidence had it was me who planned the whole thing, and nor _$boss_ nor _$pm_ were invited, since I made a point of not being seen as upper management by everyone else since I didn't feel like one given how my input were acted upon, but more on that later. Right now my mind is full of probable lawsuit  but the whole team has been waiting on us for half an hour.

&gt; _$pm_ : Go to your party, we'll handle it from here.  
&gt; _$me_ : You're sure? I'm sure they'll ask how and when it happened.  
&gt; _$boss_ : You'll tell them on Monday. In your opinion, is this solely our fault? Did you personally installed and configure these website?  
&gt; _$me_ : You're right, but I don't think _$queen_ and Legal will see it that way.  
&gt; _$boss_ : Leave them to me.  
&gt; _$pm_: No heads will roll.  

We grabbed our stuff and went to _$goodCocktailPlace_. On the way I was being paranoid with _$kohai1_ and telling him some heads will definitively roll, as they should given the fuck up. But the mood was way more joyful than us gloomy nerds were. I thanked _$youngDesignIntern_ for allowing us to escape, and he told me they all decided he was the least probable person to be fired since he was only with us for a few weeks. Some drinks were on me that night.

On Saturday I hesitated texting _$boss_ to know what was up, but I decided otherwise. Instead I texted my in-law-school best friend to ask what I should do and he had a good idea.

On Sunday morning I sent my resignation letter.

Of course this was merely the big drop that triggered the spill, as this was far from the first time the devs input were sidelined by _$boss_ and _$pm_ and it seemed to get worse over time. The bullshitting also irked me, I wouldn't have wanted to be someone with an account on these website. Given my seniority I still had to stay around __1d6__ months per my contract. But Kanye West really do songs to _quit your job to this_, so my mood was high when I clicked ""Send"" in my Thunderbird. And _$pm_ texted me to confirm he got my email.

------

On Monday I came and went straight to the manager den instead of my desk. 

&gt; _$me_ : You both got my mail? How did it went on Friday evening?  
&gt; _$boss_ : We'll talk about that later. For now focus on fixing what you can and write a beefed up post mortem. Leave _$kohai1_ out of this, I told him to work on something else.  
&gt; _$me_ : Ok, I should have a first draft for you in the afternoon if everything goes well. What should I do if a bee calls or send a ticket?  
&gt; _$pm_ : I'll handle it, you're not available to anyone today.

I grabbed 2 coffee and went to the table I shared with _$kohai1_.

&gt; _$me_ : Americano with sugar for you. What are you working on?  
&gt; _$kohai1_ : Thanks. _$boss_ wants me to see how migration works for _$bigEcommerceCms_ for _$otherClient_. The current instance has been fully patched right? Since you handled it...  
&gt; _$me_ : Take a guess. (*dramatic pause*) Well we don't have ALL the patches, but I know what they would fix and what they would break so it's OK.  
&gt; _$kohai1_ : How do you know that?  
&gt; _$me_ : I read all the changelog and most of the patch diffs. It's a pain to have a patch per issue but at least you can cherry pick and read them quickly. And since I did the hosting environment, I've hardened a bit with some special sauce.  
&gt; _$kohai1_ : Friday was scary. I don't know how we would have handled it without you.  

Was that a subtle way of telling me he was aware of my resignation? It wasn't the first time he shared this sentiment, but it had a different ring now.

----

I impressed him further when I found that one of the script disguised as a Google Analytics script was in fact our attacker script. I must say it was beautifully done : each site a different script on a very convincing domain to handle the various module and custom analytics we had that could have break the malicious script, which precisely targeted our payment method. The script was inserted in the backend with the standard way of inserting custom scripts, and left our own scripts along with the malicious one so I didn't see it on Friday.

_$pm_ had asked _$hostingProvider_ to do a full scan of recently changed files and I found the same result as them : apart from the dropped webshell nothing out of the ordinary was changed, and only one machine of the three had been impacted. Comparing database backups didn't show any config change except the script insertion. I guess the backdoor detection and script insertion was automated, and the hacker was pinged after that to check the script and adjust it at the generated address.

Did that mean we were in the clear? If you didn't talk about 2 weeks of credit card skimming, you could say so. But I still didn't know what _$queen_ and the rest of the bees had to say about that.

I wouldn't have thought my incident report would look so confident but here it was, saying the priority should be made on changing all passwords ASAP, start the patching process and asks _$hostingProvider_ how the webshell deposit and execution was even possible since they were supposed to provide a optimized and secured _$bigEcommerceCms_ instance, and should have blocked the attacker IP from the get go given how many requests were made before attacking.

When I explained everything I found to _$boss_, I didn't expect his answer :

&gt; _$boss_ : Ok, we'll do all that starting tomorrow. The client didn't blame us at all and _$hostingProvider_ explained everything and will fix it ASAP too. All the users will receive an email telling them to pay attention to their bank account for fraudulent transactions.

That was too good to be true, unreal. Exactly, that was not what I heard. The reality was way more depressing :

&gt; _$boss_ : _$queen_ was grilled by the beekeepers since they have read-only access to our ticketing system and someone saw _$competentBee_ ticket. The whole thing was kept under the rug, only _$queen_ and _$competentBee_ are aware of it and the ticket binned. _$HostingProvider_ explained us their hundreds honey a month _Firewall_ is not a _Web Application Firewall_ and only handle network attacks not web requests. Legal was not present during Friday call, nor IT, they were all home given the hour.  
&gt; _$pm_ : Change the passwords but tell them it's just standard procedure since this was not done the first time we changed hosting. Stop all work on the current tickets, from now on we only do marketing and design requests, except urgent and blocking issues.   
&gt; _$boss_ : You'll work on _$newClient_ while we're making our own audit on what E-commerce CMS we'll use for Beehive next. _$Queen_ asked me to check how feasible it would be to merge all instances under the new version of _$bigEcommerceCms_ or another CMS, and I can already tell you we'll be the one doing it and I don't have much room for how much we'll charge for that.

This was madness. I'll leave the morality out of it since shady business happens all the time, but I was glad I had chosen to leave before even hearing what I just heard, otherwise I'd have left the room to reset my ""X day since my inner peace has been nuked"" counter.

&gt; _$me_ : OK I know what you asked _$kohai1_ and I see what you had in mind. But I can already tell you half of what he'll find : doing only a migration we haven't done yet, whatever the chosen solution, will be at least 2 months of work. Add at least 1 month to sort out hosting issues. Add two months to even discuss adding new features and redoing all the custom stuff they already have like the CRM integration. I know you'll want to change design given the opportunity, so _$kohai1_ will also have at least 3 weeks just for that. Oh and on top of that, I don't think merging all these instance will even be possible given the sheer volume of data and duplicates, both in terms of products, categories and customer data. This is a 6 months ordeal even if I don't do it on my own.  
&gt; _$pm_ : We'll make sure you have a _$kohai2_ to support you, but for now we're merely auditing it to give _$beehiveClient_ a quote.  
&gt; _$boss_ : This is what you think but I already did my own analysis for _$otherClientKohai1IsNowWorkingOn_ and I quoted them 1 month for the migration + new design on _$newVersionOfBigCommerceCms_ since it's way less custom than _$beehiveClient_ instances. _$Kohai1_ will do all of it and you'll only oversee hosting changes since _$newVersionOfBigCommerceCms_ is not compatible with our own managed hosting, I already asked _$hostingProvider_ for a quote. We'll discuss your resignation next week since we have meetings all day this week.

The main reason of my resignation was despite my seniority and pompous title, I wasn't much in charge of the tech choices nor the prices we did. But even this was far worse than the usual sh*t. To this day I'm still sure our hosting, done by me despite me not being a sysadmin/devops per se, could have worked with a few tweaks. But that's the only thing I know I could have changed, the rest was already in motion and I could only watch from the shore the Titanic 2 being drawn on paper, despite already having my free ticket with my name in golden letters.

Next time I'll tell you about my final months at _$agency_ and how I fared with __The Great Migration__.

-----

As a post credits scene, _$queen_ left the beehive not soon after. I don't know if my previous feat of Friday miracle helped us regarding _$beekeepers_ ire and if she was disgusted like me or just sacked for the mistake since she chose our priorities and _$hostingProvider_. But not 3 months after that she was working in a local public organization of the same domain and asked us to quote a new corporate website hosted by _$hostingProvider_. Well at least they didn't sell anything online.

t3_dd7q4e,I've tried nothing and it still doesn't work!,"I got an email today from a coworker who's responsible for running the monthly billing cycle.  

There's currently a few improvements going on in their process which means they are looking at the warnings and errors in their process in greater detail. 

In her email she asked me if I could add a cost center to a team where they were getting some warnings from. Well sure no problem. I take a look at the team, and hmm. It already has a cost center... How strange. 

I was pretty busy at the time so I didn't think much about it and just reported back that the cost center had already been filled and went on with my day.

Cue another email a few minutes later: ""But I'm getting this warning. $externalconsultant said the warning was caused because the cost center wasn't filled!""

So I take a second look, the screenshot in her mail showed the error pretty clearly and yeah it said that the error was caused by a missing cost center value.  I take a second look at the config and well everything seems to be in order. To be sure I clear the cost center field and re-enter the data and report back to her: ""Everything's configured properly. Perhaps $consultant overlooked something else. Try running the test again to see if the warning still shows up.""

Now it's near the end of the day, things have wound down and looking for something to do I decide to look at the tests she's done. And well no more error. Why didn't she let me know?

I walk over to her desk and ask her about the error. She cuts me off telling me that $consultant said that the missing cost center causes this error. And she's just going to hope for the best for next month's billing run.

So, she never actually looked at the new results... There's a reason I don't like her that much.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_dd5qoo,The day the user learnt about electromagnetic effects,"Hope this fits here.

A little background.

I used to work for a small IT support company, think everything from printers to full small networks etc. Most of our customers were either engineering firms or small solicitor/accounts type offices.  Nothing really complicated, honest.

So a call comes in from one engineering firm that one of the managers PC's was rebooting almost every evening between 17:30 and 18:00.  So we do the usual from back in the 90's, check for errors, clean and re-seat on all cards etc.  Still no luck, so we put a clone machine in.  This was OK for a couple of day before once again its rebooting almost every evening.

This company was now getting antsy as this PC was used to print out the next days work load and the manager was having to work later to get things ready.  We get them to check the power supply to the offices, no fault found.

So after a couple more visits (we could not stay on site later as the customer would not pay the out of hours charges) my boss asked me to stay and see what the hell was going on as a favour to them.  (they were a pretty good customer, think lots of printers with metal turnings in them etc.

So 17:30 comes round and the manager is working out the next days schedule as i sit there drinking my cup of tea (us English peeps love our cuppas). He is deep in the work when i notice through a small window on the the production floor the guys parking up the electric forklifts.  5 minutes later, boom, PC reboots, manager turns the air blue and basically tells me it has to be the PC and that our company cannot do their job, etc.

I look around and ask if i can pop out onto the production floor, he agrees and we pop through.  I noticed the forklifts were all parked up against the wall to his office, right  opposite the huge charger for them, think 4 forklifts size.

So long story short, it turned out that when the guys flipped the switch to turn on the chargers the EMP burst would knock out his PC, which was of course right up against the wall opposite the charger.

Moved the PC to the other side of the desk and problem solved.

I have more and may post again depending on the feedback.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_dcu71t,Full Stop WTF answers that make me speechless.,"We have all been there. You are trying to determine the cause of an issue so you ask various questions. Sometimes you get that one answer that just… so basic and technically the truth that you have to just stop and do a double take. “Did they just say that?” You almost feel like you hit a brick wall. 

This is just a small compilation of these tales. 

First one was a session that came in using the remote tool saying her internet doesn’t work. Now the remote tool requires the internet to work, so her internet was working. This one has a double wtf answer that caused me to just stand up and take a woosah moment. 

&gt; $ME – Hello! This is $me with IT. How may I assist?      
&gt; $User – My internet is not working.      
&gt; $Me – Well I see we are connecting on *remote tool* so it appears your internet is working. What are you trying to connect to that is failing?    
&gt; $User – The internet   
&gt; $Me – Riiiiight. What website are you trying to access?  
&gt; $User- The north Dakota housing website.     
&gt; $Me – OK go ahead and try to go there and I will take over. 

She goes there and the site fails to load. I copy paste the URL into my PC and it fails to load for me too. 

&gt; $Me – OK it looks like their website is down.   
&gt; $User – No… I don’t think so it’s a government website.    
&gt; $Me – Yeah that’s par for the course for a state website.   
&gt; $User – No it has to be my internet.     
&gt; $Me – Mam… we are currently connected over the internet.   
&gt; $User – No we are on my wifi.  

I just stared at my screen for a few seconds before I could respond. 

Second one was a printer issue that was not a printer issue. Ill explain. Guy was having issues with printer printing random numbers of copies of everything he printed. 

&gt; $Me  -  Thank you for calling IT this is $Me.     
&gt; $User – Hi this is $User. My printer is on the fritz again.   
&gt; $Me – OK what is it doing?  
&gt; User – When  I go to print is prints random numbers of copies.  
&gt; $me – How so? Like what do you mean by random numbers?  
&gt; $User – well first it printed 2 copies, then 7, and then tried to print 43.    
&gt; $Me – Yeah… that’s definitely random numbers… Where are you trying to print from?    
&gt; $User – My computer. 

I had to take a second for that to click and mute my mic to keep from saying “Uhhh dahoy.” Issue was he spilled coffee on the numpad part of his keyboard and it was firing off. 

Call comes in from a girl about her passwords not working. 

&gt; $Me – Thanks for calling this is $ME.    
&gt; $User – Hello My passwords are not working.     
&gt; $ME – OK are you getting an error message when you log in or does it say invalid username or pass?   
&gt; $User – Invalid  
&gt; $Me – OK, what are you trying to log into?    
&gt; $User – Everything. 
 
(Deep sigh) I had to stare at that one for a bit. I took her to the password self service site and got her password reset. Then I clocked out and walk to my car in a daze of pure stupidity.

EDIT: Later we had a call come in that was transferred to me. 

&gt; $Me - Hello this is $Me with IT how may I assist?  
&gt; $User - I need to report that our office is off wifi and on the internet.  
&gt; $me - *Freezes for a second as I make a derp face* Ooookay thanks for reporting it.

They wouldn't answer directly what they had been using to blow the old board, but when they'd been on the phone I'd told them to leave everything plugged in so I could trace it properly.Computer, monitor, speakers... and a power brick. 18V, 3A.

I ended up having to go with an industrial surge board, because ye Gods. That's a lot of power for a DC motor, and those are not gentle when you initially start them.

I almost wish I'd thought to grab the model of the vibe when I tested it with the multimeter, because that motor would have been powerful enough for an RC car.  I pity whatever poor person tries to please that woman if she needs that amount of power for it.

The computer was fine, too. It just froze when the inrush power was requested.

[Part 2: Securely Unable to Access](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/dcj6th/securely_unable_to_access/)
_________________
At $OldFirm, stupidity wasn't in short supply especially on my team. We had a few people who were good, but most of the rest tended to be lazy and/or dumb. Especially $OldBoss, who just had a knack for signing us up for work that just doesn't make a lot of sense or required us to split up a project amongst several of us. Here's how me improving that process went:

&gt; $Me: Can we start using JIRA?

&gt; $OldBoss: I don't want to use JIRA.

It wasn't because we were not using it inside $OldFirm, because we were on the main development team. Anyhow, a statement of work comes in for $GovAgency for a Caribbean nation. A statement of work had two parts:

1. A description of what we were to do.
2. Lots of legalese formalizing the payment amount and CYA.

What we were to do usually only took up a few lines on the first page. This particular one had only one sentence:

    Move things from A into B based on information in C.

That's not even redacted folks, except for a specific word to describe what A, B, and C were that we used there. Basically I was to develop a plugin that would automatically do this for them, and in the process I had a few questions. Namely B didn't have all the same fields that A had, but $Random did, and I brought this up to $OldBoss during development:

&gt; $Me: Are we sure they want this data to go into B? I think $Random is a much better fit.

&gt; $OldBoss: No, I'm pretty sure they want the data to go into B.

...and then the words that came out of his mouth next made me go home that night and begin my job search:

&gt; $OldBoss: Besides, if it breaks and they come back we can always \*makes gesture for mo' money\*.

&gt; $Me: \*Hello jaw, meet floor.\*

That ended up causing me to do exactly what I said.
___________

Oh, the JIRA dangling thread from earlier:

I had gotten the job I had applied for several weeks before, and found out that HR and my boss were awfully chummy and found out quickly about the background check. I then proceeded to get gaslighted about how they were thinking about giving me a raise and moving me to the main development team when a position opened up. Seeing as I had put up with 8 months of a lot of stupid, and the fact that a position wouldn't have opened up for at least 4 years I took that as I would never have moved up the ladder. That and there were only three steps I could've taken anyways.

I decided to (kinda) give them one last chance (not really):

&gt; $Me: So, why do you not want to use JIRA?

&gt; $OldBoss: I just don't have access to start that process.

Doubt that.

&gt; $OldBoss: If that's a big sticking point, I'm willing to start using that if it will make your job easier.

Doubted that too. I knew he liked to run things the way he was running them because he held control, and I learned what true gaslighting was. In the end, I'm way happier than I would've been at that job and I'm making 36% more too.

Between changing jobs, I like to take a week and relax. This particular week I went back home to western Nebraska, where I'm from, and spend it with family. On that weekend of that trip, I took my 8-year-old brother down to Denver to the Aquarium and the Museum there. Didn't make it to Casa Bonita though, but it's not too big of a loss. Been there before.

So we're driving to Denver and $OldBoss messages me through my website and then through my photography Facebook page two minutes later. Odd, since he should have my phone number after eight months and annoying because I don't like to drive distracted. At some point, I eventually cool off enough to call him:

&gt; $Me: What did you need?

&gt; $OldBoss: Where did you put all your stuff at in Bitbucket?

Gee, did you ask the developers to go through the commit logs before asking me? Of course you didn't, because you don't like them because they like to be organized to a degree.

&gt; $Me: They're in \*redacted because I don't remember and I don't care\*.

&gt; $OldBoss: Cool. Thanks.

Haven't heard from him since, and I'm thankful for that. I don't think I could've learned a lot more from that place anyways.

First it was normal business talk but then she starts crying because she can't see any emails. I get her calmed down and start looking into it.

I found out She was logged into her company email. Sounds normal, but let me give you a quick background. We switched to Gsuite 2 years ago. I sent instructions for logging into the company email multiple times... She never followed them so I just forwarded her email for her since she uses a personal gmail account for business. See the problem? How this woman managed to login to the company email after 2 years of not logging in is beyond me. So, we login to her personal gmail account and there it all is.

t3_dcv177,I know now that I know nothing.,"I had a crazy thing happen to me today.

I have a coworker that we'll call John AKA Jake Smith. Seems like older people call him one name and younger people call him the other. This is a small town place and he grew up here and he's an older guy and I assume the people that knew him when he was young are the ones calling him by a nickname. Whatever.

John caught me last week to complain about his printer. He works out in the corner of the production floor I rarely visit. I walk out there when I find some time today and spend 15-20 minutes cleaning welding schmoo off rollers and giving the printer a general once over. While I work I ask him about current events, the weather, his grandkids, compliment his new flat top haircut he says reminds him of his time in the marines. Regular talk.

He asks if I fixed his email problem. I didn't know he had one. Turns out that's what he thought I was out there to fix and he didn't think the printer was really that big of a deal. He says he emailed somebody about the Outlook problem. Weird. So I check it out and his .ost file is full, just need to set him to not download all the shared mailboxes he's on. Fixed. That's why I didn't get his email telling me he wasn't getting any emails.

Head back. Get to the edge of the production floor and I hear, ""Get the printer fixed?"" Turn around and here's John F#@&amp;ING Smith, with the same F#@&amp;ING haircut he had LAST WEEK, no flat top. John F#@&amp;ING Smith has a F#@&amp;ING TWIN.

t3_dcy4cx,"What does 'filter' even mean, anyway?","Bit a different type of tech support to the usual, but I thought you guys might enjoy this story from a few years back.

I work as a lab technician in a school. The job is basically to assist science teachers - we mix the chemicals and set up all the technical equipment that they need for lessons. It's a very easy job that any organised person with common sense can do, but good or bad techs can make or break lessons - having trained as a teacher myself I've suffered on the other side of this relationship too.

*Most* science teachers respect decent techs. However, there's always some - almost invariably young trainees - who think that because I'm doing a manual job I don't know as much as them with their shiny new degrees. Incidentally, I have a Masters in mathematical biology, have worked in research labs overseas and often understand the science of their lessons better than they do. But I don't tend to advertise that, because I'm not (usually) a dick, so people make their assumptions.

Enter one such trainee, James. He was actually a nice enough guy, but a bit clueless - in one unrelated incident, he left his wallet in a taxi and blamed the driver for 'driving off with it'. But I digress.

James wanted to do an experiment showing how red, green and blue light mix to make white. Cool. James wanted light boxes plus red, green and blue acetate filters, so the students could create coloured beams and combine them to make white light. A bit tricky to get this working in practice, but okay. James wanted to put all three coloured filters in front of the *same* light box, to show that doing so results in white light shining through them... wait, what? You don't need James' mechanical engineering degree to understand that this wasn't going to work.

Now, technically, I'm only required to put out the equipment that the teacher requests, no questions asked. But because getting up in front of a class of teenagers is scary when you're not used to it, I always go out of my way to be helpful to trainees. I figured James had simply derped while planning, and that once I explained what was wrong with his setup he'd immediately understand the issue.

You guys who've been in tech support longer than I had all know where this is going.

I pointed out that filters only let light from a narrow band of wavelengths (i.e. one colour) pass through them, and that if you stack different coloured filters, any light that gets through one filter will be absorbed by another. This is not only a *really* basic physics concept, but one that he was supposed to be explaining to his eighth grade students in about an hour's time. He stared at me blankly.

I thought maybe I wasn't doing a great job of explaining the issue in words, so I said 'Look, I'll show you'. I took him to my office, set up a light box and put three different coloured filters in front of it. (This was all taking place during my lunch break, mind.) Then I explained the problem again, this time with reference to the physical example right there in front of him.

His response? 'Oh, well, I've definitely seen the experiment done this way before. It must be that your equipment's not good enough. Just put it out how I asked you to, I'll make it work.'

Well, at this point I decided I'd given him more than enough help. So I smiled, agreed, and set the equipment out exactly as he'd requested. Then I told my boss, who also happened to be the teacher who was grading James' lesson, what had happened. We passed an entertaining half hour sitting in my office next to the classroom, listening to him flounder as he tried to lead 30+ increasingly bored, then hostile 14-year-olds through an unsuccessful experiment and completely failed to understand why it wasn't working.

My boss had zero tolerance for bullshit, found my approach to the situation highly amusing, and would bring up that story from time to time until I left. Best manager ever - still miss that guy.

&gt;**Q:** Hey **Mr. X,** we're having some internet troubles here at the office, so I'm postponing with **\[NEW EMPLOYEE\]** until it's back up and running. I'm going to call her and go over what I can over the phone that doesn't require me to remote in or to show her anything  
&gt;  
&gt;**WED 1:31 PM**  
&gt;  
&gt;**X:** Will she be ready and through the training in the next hour and a half?  
&gt;  
&gt;**X:** **Q**, I have to say I'm a little annoyed. **\[NEW EMPLOYEE\]** reports that you had another client during her training time, then you had network issues and were going to call her back, then never called her back. So now she's not trained for our meeting today so now my time is going to be wasted.  
&gt;  
&gt;**WED 3:46 PM**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q:** I did have a client this morning and when it started to run long I let her know that it was running long and I would be a little delayed. I come into the office and **\[NET PROVIDER\]** is working on the lines right now which pretty much eliminates anything involving remote work. I had asked her for her phone number so that way I could call her Direct, but **\[NET PROVIDER\]** who is also my cell phone company, wasn't allowing access to 4G and I did not get the phone number until right about an hour ago. I'm very sorry that this happened, but understand all of it was out of my control  
&gt;  
&gt;**X:** A word of advice in business, **Q**: nobody really cares about excuses. I hear your story but it doesn't affect anything from my end. What I see here is that your meeting ran long and there were some tech issues. In no other work environment other than mine would that be acceptable in any way shape or form. I could ask why you didn't go to a Starbucks. Or call from a landline. Or use your home internet. I never could have built my business if I had let little things like this get in the way of my ability to deliver results. You shouldn't either.

*Note:* He straight up asks why I can't ***go to Starbucks or go home***. I don't know, maybe because I have, like, a job? And our landline is a VOIP by the way as many are. Not to mention, my home net and the Starbucks here use the same provider we do...and they were out. The nearest Starbucks that doesn't use our provider is 45 minutes from the office. Yes, I'm in a small town.

&gt;**TODAY 9:21 AM**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q:** To update you on yesterday, **\[NET PROVIDER\]** experienced an attack. They had to shut down many their connections they deemed relevant. I assume since we bounce internationally on a VPN, we were deemed relevant. I just checked it at the office this morning it's back up and running  
&gt;  
&gt;**X:** Clarifying an excuse doesn't make it somehow matter. Excuses still don't matter to anybody. That said, I'm glad you're up and running.

Yeah...eff that noise, I'm out.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_dcii8i,"""I...I... blew up my computer...""","Names have been changed to protect the innocent.  But not the guilty. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was a young, motivated, and inexperienced computer engineer working at a small company that built inspection machines for a niche market.  These inspection machines consisted of WinTel computers along with some specialized hardware for interfacing with the inspection sensors and general control, enclosed in a nice air-conditioned cabinet for all the electrically-bits.  The software was developed in-house as well and ran on top of Windows.  If you ever worked in manufacturing before, you've probably run across this kind of setup before.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this company built the computers in house from off-the-shelf parts.  Intel CPUs, Samsung SSDs, Crucial RAM, Supermicro mobos, you get the drift.  Each developer got an exact copy of the currently shipping hardware and machine components, so it would be easy to develop and test locally.  The hardware was always on the mid-to-high end, so this worked out well for everyone.  There was a sole IT professional that handled the company's IT needs (obviously) and did the purchasing and inventory for the WinTel components.

&amp;#x200B;

The antagonist of our story (mentioned above) was a fresh college graduate with a degree in Computer Engineering with a focus on embedded systems.  So when a small project came up for a small embedded peripheral to this peripheral, the CpE volunteered to take it, and management approved.

&amp;#x200B;

On to the story.  Characters:

CpE: Smart, yet inexperienced engineer.  Antagonist.

IT: Information Technologist of the House Support, 30 Million of His Name, King of the Servers, the rightful Admin of all PCs and protector of the databases, King of Active Directory and Khal of the network.

&amp;#x200B;

Scene: IT's office.

&lt;knock knock&gt;

IT looks up to see CpE standing meekishly in the doorway, looking as guilty as a young puppy who peed on the carpet after house training.

CpE: ""I...need to pull a new motherboard, keyboard, and USB hub from stock.  I'm not sure if... I'm going to need more components.""

IT: ""...Okay.  We have the parts in stock, but what's this about?  Usually stock pulls are for complete machines.  Is there something wrong with a machine on the shop floor?""

CpE: ""Nothing wrong with production as far as I know.  I...just...ummm....well....it's....""

&amp;#x200B;

The CpE is staring at his shoes and moving in a clearly uncomfortable fashion.  Something is clearly wrong and all evidence points to CpE as the guilty party.

&amp;#x200B;

IT: ""Sit down and tell me what happened.""

CpE: ""I...I... blew up my computer..."" &lt;sniff&gt;

IT: "" ... wat?""

CpE: &lt;tears welling up&gt; ""I blew up my computer.  I didn't mean to.  I was working on the new embedded peripheral prototype...and....and....""

IT: ""go on...""

CpE: ""I was rearranging the hardware on my desk when I heard this loud 'POP'.  I looked up at my monitors and they were all black.  I heard all the fans running at 100% and there was smoke pouring out of my keyboard and computer case.""

IT: ""ummm...""

CpE: ""I cut power to everything.  The embedded peripheral, PC, monitors, everything in my cubicle.  I tried bringing my PC back up, but nothing happened when I pressed the power button.  I opened up the side of the case and there was black charring around the USB ports on the motherboard.""

IT: ""So what happened?""

CpE: ""I think I put 24V on the 5V USB rail by accident"".

IT: ""...""

CpE: ""..."" &lt;sniff&gt;

IT: ""How?""

CpE: ""I &lt;siff&gt; left some wires hanging loose off the prototype and must have bumped them.  I had a USB adapter &lt;sniff&gt; that I was using to communicate with the prototype and the loose wires touched something they shouldn't have. &lt;sniff&gt;  The main power supply on the prototype is 24V and one of the loose wires was on the 24V supply.  It touched the 5V USB rail on the USB adapter""

IT: ""...""

CpE: ""...""

IT: ""...""

CpE: ""... am I going to get fired? ...""

IT: ""How much equipment, in dollars, do you think you destroyed?""

CpE: ""....ummm....""

IT: ""Answer honestly.""

CpE: ""...$500...."" &lt;sniff. grabs a tissue from the box on IT's desk&gt;

IT: ""$500. Mkay.  Assuming *everything* company owned in your cubicle got fried, that's probably, what? 3 grand worth of equipment, right?""

CpE: &lt;gasp.  starts sobbing&gt;

IT: ""Wait.  I haven't finished""

CpE: &lt;looks up in horror&gt;

IT: ""Have you ever brought an embedded control system to market before?""

CpE: &lt;slowly shakes head no&gt;

IT: ""This was a prototype you were working on?""

CpE: &lt;nods yes&gt;

IT: ""Something went wrong and the magic white smoke came out?""

CpE: &lt;nods yes&gt;

IT: ""Remind me again: What went wrong?""

CpE: ""I &lt;sniff&gt; left some &lt;sniff&gt; power wires loose &lt;sniff&gt; and they &lt;sniff&gt; touched the adapter!!!!""

IT: ""I see.  You left some wires loose, they got bumped, and some electronics got destroyed.""

CpE: &lt;sniff&gt; ""yes"" &lt;sniff&gt;

IT: ""Grab another tissue.  Here's what's going to happen.  I'm going to pull the components to another complete system for you from stock.  You're going to go back to your cubicle and rebuild your PC.  I know you can handle this since your built your PC on your 1st day here.  You're going to return all of the old components to me for proper disposal.  Keep the original SSD if it still works.  No point in reinstalling the OS since the replacement hardware is identical and the SSD probably survived.  You're probably going to be back up and running in an hour.""

CpE: &lt;puzzled look&gt;

IT: ""What did you learn?""

CpE: &lt;even more puzzled look&gt;

IT: ""It's not a trick question.  What did you learn?""

CpE: ""Never leave wires flying in the breeze?"" 

IT: ""Bingo.  5, 10, 20 years from now, you will never make this mistake again.  This company just spent, at most, 3 grand training you.  I don't know what you make salary wise, but my guess is the equipment you destroyed, worst case, is the equivalent of 5 days of what this company spends on you.  It probably cost over $20,000 to hire you, considering the recruiter fees, HR time, interview time, and so on.  

&amp;#x200B;

You did something that cost the company a pittance compared to what it took to hire your, never mind your salary and benefit cost.  You obviously know what you did wrong, and you'll never make this mistake again.  If the company fired you over this, they'd be spending another $20 grand minimum to replace you.  Shit happens.  It's happened to me, it's happened to you, it happens to everyone.  You're young.  You're inexperienced.  College should teach you how to learn, and you've learned from this.

&amp;#x200B;

Now take these parts, rebuild your PC, and let me know if you need anything else.""

CpE: ""Tha.... Thank you""

IT: ""This isn't the first time I've dealt with with destroyed parts and this won't be the last.  Just don't leave wires loose again.""

CpE: ""Absolutely""

This happened about 5 years ago.  I was the CpE, and I'll never forget these lessons.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_dca8bf,Can you show me the computer?,"In 1984 I was an enterprising young geek, all of 16. At the time I had been the first kid in my school to own their own computer - a Commodore VIC 20 - and I was well on the way to my current career in computing.

One sunny day I got on my bicycle and peddled from Leiden where I lived, about 40 km up the road to Amsterdam where the action was.

Being a geek, action consisted of a travelling high technology roadshow put together by IBM. It showcased the latest and greatest in information technology.

Word spread quickly around the hall that I was the crazy kid who cycled 40 km to come and see the roadshow. Being so very excited and interested opened doors that otherwise might not have, had things been different.

Two displays made a lifetime impression.

One of the demonstrated technologies was a voice recognition system. The presenter had a cold and the software was having trouble, even though she had spent several hours retraining it. As a joke, I repeated the command and it recognised and then proceeded to respond to my instructions. Lots of fun to play with. 

The most memorable technology was a large high resolution display with a highly detailed wireframe model of the Space Shuttle. Picture a Shuttle, mounted to the external tank and two solid rocket boosters. It wasn't quite to the level of individual components, but it was the most detailed model I'd ever seen, then and since.

Next to the display was a board with eight knobs that you could turn to make the wireframe turn in realtime. One knob for roll, one for yaw, one for pitch and one for zoom.

The thing about these knobs was that they were very smooth to operate. So much so that you could flick them and like a top they'd keep spinning and the wireframe Space Shuttle would also keep spinning. The spinning knobs were so smooth that you had time to spin more than one simultaneously and the model would spin accordingly.

After playing with that for a bit I sidled up to the person managing the display and said: ""That's really cool, but that's not the computer. Can you show me the computer that's actually doing the work?""

A grin appeared and in hushed tones I was shown to the back of the hall, following thick bundles of cable, through the back door outside.

There were two semi-trailers parked next to the hall. Picture two purpose built eighteen wheelers, white, not unlike large refrigerated food trucks.

The attendant pointed at one and said: ""That's the power supply ..."", then pointed at the other: ""... and that's the computer that spins the Shuttle.""

t3_dcj6th,Securely Unable to Access,"I've been wanting to share this story for a while now, but have been busy so I never got around to it. This happened at $OldFirm (guys who made $DocManager) last year, which makes this story all the more WTF-y. Also, main characters (outside of the client) are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/d7bgyh/stuck_in_sap/).
_______________
So, we got this statement of work in for this one client who is huge in the medical industry (like, almost only the players bigger are state and federal governments huge) and they seem to be having an issue with one of the plugins we wrote for them years ago. They have a Java servlet (important) that calls our plugin via SOAP (ASMX Web Service, we're a .NET shop) and ever since we upgraded them the plugin doesn't seem to work. Alas, as the developer on the team that is to handle this, I get it in my lap.

Naturally, I did a diff on the ASMX they had running (they had the cloud version, not too difficult to obtain) and what we had in our application as we had integrated this plugin some odd years back into the main codebase. Of course, the diff doesn't tell me much other than there's nothing wrong with our code, but we ""have to fix it"" according to $ProjectManager. So, I do a code review of their servlet that is calling the ASMX Web service and don't see anything that could magically cause 0 results to be returned. I did see anti-patterns galore, but that's another story. Anyhow, this isn't /r/programminghorror, so back to the story.

So, eventually I check their setup and lo behold, they were searching on the wrong field to get the data they want back. Might have gotten changed during the upgrade, but these are lazy developers from Kerbleckistan so of course they didn't bother checking if they were searching the right field or not. Let them know what to do and sent them on their merry way, thinking I would never have to deal with them again. Boy, was I wrong.

&gt; $Client: We are now getting this error "" javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: \*I forget the rest.\*"".

So before this had happened, our server administration team had upgraded the SSL certificate on our servers before our current cert expired (like any decent admins would). Little did we know that $Client would have problems caused by this. So I do all sorts of roundabout things like having them import the SSL cert into the keystore that I had to prepare for them (instructions, the cert, the works) because for some odd reason (used to be a Java developer, am now again) I knew more about this than they did (actual Java developers at the time). Well, I have tried just about all I can think of to figure out what they need to do to fix the problem.

&gt; $OldBoss: We have got to get this fixed for them! Do all you can! I have faith in you!

Yeah, after a few private encounters with him I doubted that, but moving on. I actually get this idea to write a simple Java app and test it with several Java versions:

1. Java 8: Nope, can connect just fine.
2. Java 7: Nope, can connect just fine.
3. Java 6: Huh, handshake failure just like $Client. Bingo.

So I ask the client what version of Java they're using, and they respond with (quelle grand suprise): Java 6. F$CK! Apparently Java 6 doesn't support the new SSL algorithm we use, because it's 12 YEARS OLD BY THIS POINT! Also, Oracle was one month out from dropping paid support for Java 6 too soooo....

&gt; $Client: What do we do to fix this?
&gt; $Me: Upgrade your Java runtime to at least 7, but I recommend 8 as you will have support for longer.

Apparently, someone over there didn't like that response:

&gt; $ClientBoss: Listen, we're losing money every day because our system isn't working because it cannot send and fetch data from $DocManager! You need to do something about this NOW!

So, relevant: $DocManager has resellers that package it with other software to automate workplace stuff, and normally they will throw us under the bus whenever possible. Not today:

&gt; $Reseller: They have given you a perfectly adequate solution. It is up to you, not them, to apply it to your systems and to get them working.

And with that, I never had to deal with that client again. Still owe $Reseller a beer for his response. Said what I wanted to, and I didn't have to deal with the repercussions for it.

I think about the stories like that, and I'm glad I left.

t3_dcdfsx,umbrella brought the wifi down,"First post, be gentle, common courtesy, yadda yadda yadda... Also, long - sorry. 

So, I‘m a teacher at a secondary school which is fairly advanced in regard to IT-equipment: All classrooms are equipped with LAN, Smartboards (digital whiteboards with interactive projectors), a Windows-PC and an Apple-TV - it‘s a compromise to get each and every teacher the tools they (think they) need in the digital age. Additionally, there is campus wide wifi, which works well most days, and occasionally not at all. The whole system has a server at the center that runs a proprietary variant of Debian Linux including DHCP for the whole network.

For reasons that have become hazy over the past couple of years I have become the go-to tech guy for most of the teachers - I‘m sort of self taught, have always been interested in the stuff, and even though there should be some sort of professional IT-support, due to lack of funding... there isn‘t. So when the system has a hiccup, I‘m the guy they call for help. I‘m not IT, and my lack of knowledge especially in regard to networks should be apparent from this text. I‘m the prototypical one-eyed king among the blind. Believe me, that‘s not a good feeling.

This happened this morning.

I‘m about to start my lesson, but can‘t log in on the PC in my room. I should be able to log in with my Windows domain account, but after the login-prompt nothing really happens. I notice that the access point in the room has a red blinking light, which means it can‘t connect to the internet and do it‘s job. I try to reach the webfacing interface for our server on my iPad, which is connected to the school‘s wifi, but get a „you are not connected to the internet“-warning. My students - all equipped with iPads, report the same. 

A knock on the door, a student from another class enters the room:

student: „Ahem, Mr. JoeDoe23, could you come to room so-and-so, Mrs. Teacher1 can‘t log in to the PC in order to use the smartboard...?“

me: „with you in a minute, tell her I‘ll be down soon.“

OK, seems to affect more than just my room... I turn off the wifi on my iPad and try to reach the server via data - which to my surprise works. I can log in, everything‘s dandy. I tell my students to stay put and head to the server. Log in as root, run a chk - everything appears to be fine. I head over to another room, but am interrupted by another student that is looking for me:

student2: „Mr. JoeDoe23, Mr. Teacher2 told me to get you, nothing‘s working...“

me: „I‘m on it, tell him to wait it out, it seems to be a bigger problem...“

In the teachers lounge I try to log into another computer - no go. Back to the server, restart the whole thing. (I told you I‘m no IT-guy, I‘m just „the guy“... it‘s not like I really know what to do... but I can restart the thing - whatever the thing is - and know that 85% of the time that‘ll do the trick!) No change. Alright, time to do the dreadful thing and call the company that does the real support for the server. (It‘s dreadful because I am in the terrible situation that my colleagues perceive me as a IT-god because I‘m always fixing their stuff, but „real“ IT-folks look down on me, because I‘m just an imposter that breaks their stuff... enter relevant xkcd or other webcomic in the comments!)

me: „Yeah, uh, hi there, it‘s Mr. JoeDoe23, we‘re having some trouble with out network today, and since your server is doing the DHCP-thing I was wondering if you could remote in an have a look of sorts...?“

very friendly support guy (they‘re not so friendly most of the time, so I felt the need to add this info here): „Let me see... the server is running fine... but I can see that the DHCP-queue is clogged up to the max (my words, not his!). It appears you have some sort of loop in the network.“

me: „what do you mean, loop? As in, someone has shorted a switch with a patch cable somewhere on the premises?“

very friendly support guy: „yup, sounds about right.“

me: „so what do I do? check each and every room’s sLAN-outlet (is that even the right term?) and switch for an incorrectly plugged-in cable?“

very friendly support guy: „that‘s exactly the only thing you can do... good luck.“ [hangs up]

(I dramatized here - of course he didn‘t hang up on me, he‘s a professional... we said our good byes and I hung up first.)

Alright, back to my class, tell the students to keep chillin‘ - which they happily obliged... „no worries, Mr. JoeDoe23 - do your thing, we‘re good here!“ And off to check each and every classroom, looking for the loop. 
In every room, the same situation: teachers improvising, because they can‘t access their stuff since they can‘t log in:

Teachers3, 4, n: „Hey, good you‘re here - the system‘s down, what‘s going on?“

me: „don‘t know, I‘m on it, checking every room, loop somewhere...“

After 24 rooms... no dice. Another teacher bumps into me in the hallway:

Teacher25: „JoeDoe23, what‘s going on, wifi‘s out, I can‘t login...?!?“

me: „server-support says there‘s a loop in the LAN somewhere, I‘m checking every classroom... hope I can find it soon.“

Two rooms later, still no loop, Teacher25 comes in:

Teacher25: „I think I found it! Come with me...!“

Now I‘m intrigued - so far, the whole ordeal has cost me about an hour, my lesson for this morning has gone to shit, but maybe we can salvage the rest of the day.  Teacher25 takes me to his room, which until recently was a computer and still has the LAN-outlets (again, that word?) on the walls. He‘s pointing at a student, who is not looking very happy. 

Teacher25: „So I said to my students upon returning from our short conversation just minutes ago: It‘s still down, Mr. JoeDoe23 is looking for some sort of loop in the network, no idea really what that means... when young Mr. Student over here points to the LAN-outlet behind him and says: Like that?“

Turns out: It was raining this morning, and Mr. Student had his umbrella with him... and upon entering the classroom, he was looking for a place to put it... and he noticed a short patch-cable dangling from a LAN-outlet (sorry!)... so he took the loose end, plugged it in the second channel in order to have a place to hang his umbrella! And he brought down the whole network, and with it the whole school...!

Unplugged the cable, and I could hear and feel a resounding breath of relief throughout the whole campus, as teachers and students were suddenly able to log in, warning-lights on access-points switched back to white... and we were back online.

TL;DR: Student created a loop with a patch cable to hang his umbrella, brought down the whole network.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_dc5mkr,$3000 wasted,"I was a Custodian at a good sized School District and had slowly worked my way onto the day shift as an Assistant Supervisor.

I was tech savy and people would generally ask me to help them with computers (except macs, never owned one).  I had a good working knowledge of audio/visual as well, so I was tasked with setting up the technology for most of the meetings/gatherings etc.

Every single classroom had these 20 year old CRT televisions that were mounted to the wall.  They were ""industrial or institution"" models.  All they had on the back were BNC connectors (labeled Video/yellow r/Red L/White) and a RF input.  (Most people know that BNC is just a RCA jack that is designed to lock into place to be tamper proof)
These TVs had like 10 video inputs which were for security cameras. 

They had bought all these new DVD players and wanted to connect them.  So the ""official Tech/AV guy"" got a plan approved to buy RF converters (Basically turns the RCA Output of the DVD into a signal on the coax Channel 3 or 4).  Now with 80 TV's that runs into some money!

Each RF converter (I don't know where they ordered them) cost them $15!

When The order was delivered on the dock I went directly to the Principal and got the info.  I informed her that we could buy RCA to BNC adapters for $.50 each (so each TV would cost $1.50).

So AV guys plan = 80\*15= $1200

My plan = 80\*1.50 = $120

The AV Guy refused to even consider that it would work -- Swore up and down that BNC was a nonstandard format and was useless for this.  I asked the Principal to not open the converters for a day.

I drove to Radio Shack (I'm old, Huh LOL) and bought 3 BNC-RCA adapters.  ($3)

The next day I pulled the principal vice principal into a classroom and had them watch me hook up a dvd player.  The AV guy was pissed off (I'm pretty sure that he was pissed cause I'm just a janitor and not only that -- he didn't think of it!)

It worked perfectly.  That AV guy thought it was fluke -- he pulled it off and we moved to another room and he hooked it up - Because you're just a janitor.  Guess what it worked there too.

I explained the differences (or lack thereof) of RCA vs BNC (same analog signal, with a tamperproof connector) to the AV guy and he reluctantly said my idea would work.

He still wanted to use the RF Converters.  The principals backed me up and returned the converters.

I had to fight that AV guy everytime I needed to setup something from then on -- until he got fired for destroying a $3,000 server. Idiot had a pepsi can tip over onto it while he was re-cabling!

Just cause I'm a janitor doesn't mean I'm stupid.

t3_dcbghv,You updated my computer wrong!,"So just a small vent here about somthingthat got me riled up. So a few days ago my father was having computer issues with the picture on his screen. So i automatically assumed it was a out of date driver. 

So with his permission i downloaded Nvidia Geforce (the updater for all Nividia cards) ans ran a check. Sure enough it was extreamly out of date. Now as i ran the update it shows pictures of games ans the update ot called game ready driver because the brand is focused around gaming. I explainee this to him and he understood.

So about a week later i wake up to my father yelling at me telling me i fucked up his computer by downloading a gamer driver. He told me i shouldnt use any programs and should update it directly though the computer (whatever that means). Oh ans to top it off he doesnt want me touching his (my brothers btw) computer anymore.

Maybe i should let this get to me as much but its like i did one nice thing then get yelled at because apparently i messed up a computer because apparently he had 2 graphic drivers running at the same time (However that is possible i dont know) according to him.

t3_dcb8wu,The snowball-effect applied to an Exchange-Server,"Hey there.
 
This Tale is rather short but hilarious. I was working at a big company with couple of 10.000 employees sitting in multiple countries. It was a normal day, but after lunch a strange mail flew into my inbox which simply stated ""This is a test"". Looking at the sender it simply stated ""test@&lt;Company&gt;.com"", where &lt;Company&gt; was the domain for the company I was working for. Before I could even think of what has happened, a second mail came in. Same sender, the contents this time in french and the subject did indicate, that this was an answer to the original mail. Shortly after - more answers. They kept going. 

""What the heck is going on?"" was coming from behind me. Apparently, everyone in our office did receive those messages and my boss was kind of freaking out about it. About 15 minutes later everything stopped - Exchange-Server was not happy and decided to go on vacation, for 2 whole days.

Long Story short: ""test@&lt;company&gt;.com"" was configured to bounce every mail received to all existing mail-addresses with ""@&lt;company&gt;.com"". However the forwarded mail was having ""test@&lt;company&gt;.com"" in the sender-field. This meant replying to the mail would cause the same effect of sending a mail company wide. Some employees were acknowledging the test, others did not understand french and did wanted to know what is going on, basically DOS'ing the Exchange-Server with each reply they made.  
Never thought that something like this can happen to a company that big.

TL;DR: Never set up a mail-account to forward the message to everyone in the company as the original sender (Especially if there is no testing of privilege what-so-ever).",talesfromtechsupport
t3_dc3jou,"Professors complaint: ""My mouse isnt working""","Background, I work in the AV department of a smaller college. AV, means audio visual, but people often mistake us and IT as the same, but it isn't. I work on the projectors, monitors, speakers and control box in each of the classrooms of the college. We get calls that should go to IT all the time, but since they leave at 5, and I work until 8, I sometimes go and see if I can help on IT calls, if i think i can help. 

So, i get a call from a professor asking if i can look at the mouse, as it wasnt working. I told them that it is really more of an IT thing, but i would come down and look at it and see if i can fix it, if not i would get a hold of IT to fix it in the morning. So, i walk all the way across the campus, and up a flight of stairs and into the class. The class is there, bored, waiting for class to start. Everything is quiet. The screen is showing the projector, they're logged into the computer, it looks good until I walk to the podium and immediately see the problem with the mouse. I kind of bite my tongue and ask the teacher what she thinks the problem is, she doesnt answer. Turns out, this is the sign language teacher, and she is completely deaf, and a student called me for her. 

So I ask the student to tell her what the problem was, and because this is an ADVANCED sign language class, most of the class had learned at the very least the basics of sign language. So I wanted to whisper to the professor what it was, because it would make her look stupid to her class, but because she is deaf, she needs it signed to her, and she believes in a ""paperless classroom"" according to the students, and there were no markers to be found for the white board. So after I whispered the problem to the student, and showed her the problem, she burst out laughing like it was the funniest thing she has ever heard.

Once she recovered, she signed (I'm assuming, I dont know sign language) ""YOU WERENT USING THE MOUSE, IT WAS THE ERASER FOR THE WHITE BOARD"" after she was done signing, the professor turned a deep red, and most of the class erupted in a chorus of laughter. I pulled the rolling tray where the mouse and keyboard are, and hiding in the back was the real mouse. I asked if they had any questions and went back to the office. Still one of my favorite stories. Thanks for reading!

Edit: for those curious, here is a picture of the ""mouse."" https://imgur.com/gallery/2pz0Mao

Honestly, it does look a lot like a mouse. I also have a funny story about how a professor was trying to use the wrong remote to turn on a projector in an older room, and the remote was a desk decoration from another professor that shares the room with them. It was a prop from star trek next generation.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_dbw8f2,I don't care if it's on FIRE! It's a minor problem,"Long time stalker first post so here goes.
This will be a bit long so I can give you some background into this story.

TL:DR at bottom


I was a service tech for 15 years, pretty much anything in an office (computers, printers, copiers, typewriters, camera systems, etc.) but was not formally trained in the field when I first started. I originally went to school for electronics and computers so I had some trouble shooting skills. This tale is of when I went on my first solo call after 3 months of training. I got a LOT more stories so I'll see how this goes and go from there.


When I was hired I was trained as an office equipment tech for mostly copiers, printers, and faxes. I went for ride along with two senior techs for three months to learn the ropes, depending on what we were looking at I'd be with either one. Chris was my main boss, he was a bit of a sales guy but mostly tech. He showed me the ropes and how to make suggestions based from a service stand point, if something could work better for a customers needs by suggesting upgrades or another piece of equipment to handle any issues they were having. 


Now the other tech Scott was a no nonsense, let's get this stuff fixed and move on kind of guy. The first thing he told me and constantly repeated before a call was ""When talking to the about the equipment's issues it's always a minor problem, no matter what the customer says it's a minor problem. I don't care if it's on fire, it's ALWAYS a minor problem."" His reasoning for this was to try and de-escalate any issues they may be having so the customer would hopefully calm down thinking we'd have it fixed in no time. After 15 years I'd say 7/10 issues really are just minor problems, but not this one.


My first solo call was to go on site and replace a belt on an old dot matrix printer (the old ream feed, normally used for reports printer). The customer called in saying the belt that drove the print head busted and they just wanted to order a new one and have it installed once it came in, no initial diagnosis was done by us, its what they wanted. Ok, we order the part and once it comes in my trainers say this will be a good first call to do solo, just a part replacement and cleaning should be easy.



Cue deer in headlights and stomach in throat montage. I get on site and thankfully the printers in a fairly accessible location with a nice big counter for me to work on it. I tear this printer apart, vacuum, blow, and wipe probably 10+ years of dust and crap out of it. Oil up all the shafts and bits that need it. Replace the belt and pop everything back together, not to hard. Now comes the moment of truth, time to test it. I had one of the office girls send a print job to make sure everything is working and it rolls into action. It's sailing back and forth looking like new and I breath a sigh of relief thinking all is well. That is until the printer gets about four pages spit out the back when all of a sudden the print head stops mid stride and a horrible grinding sound is heard coming from the printer, followed by a flame about 5-6 inches coming straight out the top of the printer. Cue me scrambling like a madman to unplug everything from it and make sure the paper doesn't catch on fire. Thank the tech overlords the paper was feeding out the back and I didn't have the top cover shut entirely so I could watch it work. I'm standing there mouth agape and my body soulless, WHAT DID I DO!!! The office girls half snickering half dumb founded and standing behind them is the OWNER OF THE COMPANY!!! Cut to internal monologue of ""Well, I'm dead and fired"". He just saw this whole thing, flames and all and all he does is go ""Huh, cool!"" and proceeds to walk away into his office. I somehow manage to say Scotts line of ""Don't worry, just a minor problem. I'm sure we can fix it"" and I excuse myself so I can go outside and make a phone call.


I ring Chris and Scott, they were normally together when we were slow, and I get ahold of Chris. This is what followed:  
Chris: Yeah, what's up, everything going ok.  
Me: No, not really I had a bit of a minor problem. The um, the printer caught on fire.  
*insert a good minute long pause of dead silence*  
Chris: Come again? I don't think I heard you right.  
Me: I had a bit of a minor problem. The printer caught on fire.  
*insert another 30 second+ pause of silence*  
Chris: Ok, your on speaker Scott's here what EXACTLY has happened?  
Me: *insert above paragraph*  
At this point I can here Scott in the background dying from laughter.  
Chris: We'll what does the owner want us to do.  
Me: I don't know, I didn't ask. I figured I should call you for help, I'm screwed aren't I?  
Chris: Well that depends on what the owner wants to do. Offer to bring it back to the shop so we can look at it, no charge for anything so far. Find out and call me back.  


*Cue dead man walking scene from any prison movie*


I go back inside and head over to the owners office to see what he wanted to do. I explain that I can take it back to the shop and see if we can revive the charred corpse of his printer, no charge for anything so far.  
Owner: Na, just junk it, we've had that thing for ages. It was having issues where it'd just stop mid job for a while anyway. I was just looking up a newer model and it's not too expensive, we'll just replace it.  I'm amazed it didn't die sooner, cool how It caught on fire though. Can you scrap it for us?  
Me: *jaw on floor and stuttering to find words* Absolutely we can scrap it, If you want I can have my boss talk to you about the new printer he may be able to get you a deal.  
Owner: Sure, have him give me a call then.  
I proceed to pack up all my tools and the crispy printer in the van and start to head back to what I'm expecting to be a pink slip. Once on the road I call Chris and let him know what the owner said. He says everything is fine, head back to the shop and they'll meet me there later, bring the printer into the shop and see if I can figure out what happened.


Once back at the shop I took everything back apart and started trying to figure out what the heck happened to make this thing burst into flames. Turns out the print head had bad bushings that rode on the shafts going side to side and that caused it to seize up and wouldn't let the head move. My guess was that the because of the old belt it would just slip due to age and really crappy teeth in the rubber. The motor would keep running even though the printhead was stopped. Well put a brand new (tight, strong, new rubber teeth) belt into this equation and what you get is a motor trying to spin but not able to which caused it to overheat, which made the wires coming off it to get warm and that made the whisper thin coating melt. Once that coating melted the voltage wire hit frame and voltage grounded to frame makes for a VERY hot wire, that proceeded to burn about 4 inched along the bottom of the printer.


About an hour after I get back and am done messing with the printer Scott walks in grinning ear to ear.   
Scott: Where we going after work, I owe you a beer. You did good kid, It's always a minor problem. Something actually caught fire and you stayed true to my advice.   
Chris: Please don't make a habit out of this. But good job, you had crappy situation and you came out ok.  
I had them both take a look at the printer and see what they thought went wrong. They came to pretty much the same conclusion. I lived to try and ""fix"" something else another day.

Edits for the grammar police


TL:DR - Went out on first solo service call after being taught that all problems are a minor issue, even if somethings on fire.

t3_dc01n5,We have a spy... or a ghost... or something.,"Unlike most of the stories here, there are no villains or idiots in this one. We hit a very strange problem and only solved it with a bit of dumb luck.

This took place around 2005 or so - just before the first wave of commercially-available grid computing products. I was working as a developer at a small black box hedge fund and, as is often the case at small hedge funds, my team was also responsible for supporting the trading application we'd built.

We have about fifty active traders at the time. Each trader has three PCs under their desk running our proprietary trading software. Each PC has two screens and is responsible for trading options on ~50 underlying stocks. Our software uses a plug-in model that allows the quants to write pricing strategies in C#.

I've worked with enough quants to know that they're generally brilliant mathematicians and terrible coders. So, when they introduce a pricing strategy that slows the trading machines down dramatically any time it works with an underlying security that pays dividends, I suggest we (the developers) review their code to make it performant.

Absolutely not, the director of the quants tells us. This is QUANT CODE. We would never understand it.

Fine, we can't change the code and the quants are never going to learn how to optimize, so we come up with the solution. The trading machines will hand off market data about the ""problematic securities"" to dedicated machines that will do nothing but crunch price models and then pass the results back. Because the trading machines are all Windows and the quant code is in C#, these machines will be Windows as well and they'll distribute the market data and the pricing models via Microsoft Messaging Queue (MSMQ.) We throw this together and it works remarkably well with one limitation - these are Windows desktops, not servers. They can't connect to more than ten peers at a time via MSMQ.

That's fine for about a month, then we're called into an urgent meeting. The lead trader tells us that someone is hacking into our systems and stealing our pricing data. He knows this because the trading machines are periodically getting selectively disconnected from the pricing machines, but they continue to show a full complement of active connections.

A hedge fund's pricing data is its life's blood. So, we go onto red alert. IT goes over the network access logs and can find no incursion. The developers go over the application logs and don't see any anomalies. All the IP addresses the trading machines are connecting to are in the correct subnet to be pricing servers. Management even brings in an audit team to go over our results in case the whole thing is an inside job by IT or trading systems development to steal the firm's intellectual property.

Roughly six weeks into the investigation, we find a breakthrough. The pricing servers are assigned their IP addresses dynamically and normally wind up with (for example) 10.10.16.1 through 10.10.16.10, but sometimes they skip an address and wind up shifted so that they miss one of the sequential addresses and wind up claiming 10.10.16.11. The trading systems continue to treat this ""missing"" IP address as a pricing machine. They send market data to it, but they never get a price back. We set up an audible klaxon in the server room to go off whenever 10.10.16.11 is claimed.

In the meantime, we rewrite the pricing server and the trading system to have an active handshake during discovery so that we're not wasting bandwidth and time, both of which are at a premium in black box trading. During that time, the klaxon only goes off once and the mysterious problem goes away.

Two weeks later, we've got all the pieces ready to go into production, but the problem's not recurring and deployments are labor intestive (this is before CI/CD.)  We have a meeting in the main IT room so we can include IT without leaving the network unmonitored.

After about an hour, we're going around in circles with no one wanting to take responsibility for a decision to deploy or not to deploy the new code. One of the sysadmins gets a call on his cell phone, answers it briefly, then plugs it into a USB port on his desktop.

The klaxons go off. Sysops jump to see what's going on. The developers all sit where they are and stare at sysadmin's phone. After a few minutes of sysop speak trying to diagnose what caused the IP address to be claimed, my managing director says. ""Jerry, unplug your phone for a second.""

He does and 10.10.16.11 vanishes off the network.

When the smoke clears, we've discovered that the IP theft isn't intellectual property. It's Internet Protocol. Whenever Jerry plugs his phone into a USB port, it claims an IP address. He usually plugs it into a charger on the other side of the room that's not connected to a PC or doesn't plug it in until after the pricing servers have started up for the day. It's only when he plugs it in before or during the pricing server startup sequence that the trading systems discover it, think it's a pricing server, and try to send it market data.

We wound up not needing to install the modified server code, but the IT room does get some huge signs that read, ""Do not plug any devices into sysadmin PCs via USB.""",talesfromtechsupport

t3_dbkjqy,When going beyond scope and failing compliance is the best for everybody,"As previously mentioned, senior tech support for the Fruit company.

In this story, the customer called in to do 3 things:

&amp;#x200B;

* Get her email verified on her newly created account;
* Sign in on her new phone;
* Download Whatsapp.

This lady sounded within retirement age and didn't have the first clue about technology. Her account had been created for her and a password was given to her but that was it.

To verify her email, she needed to have access to it. She wouldn't have it on her phone but she had on her computer. 

I screenshare on her computer, go to the webmail page and find she is not signed in and doesn't know the password. Thankfully, I notice a friendly Outlook icon on the task bar and lo and behold, all her emails were there.

Now I needed to send a verification email.

I guided her to the website to sign in to her account: *""Password incorrect""*. ""Try again"", I said. ""*Password incorrect.*""

She never told me the password, but she was mumbling it as she typed. 

And then I heard a ""*space...I...M....*"". I stopped her, most probably failing in compliance for this but I advised her that passwords don't usually contain spaces. She types in the password without spaces and voila, we are in. I quickly told her to mend her written down password.

We send the verification email and verify it promptly. Now came the biggest hurdle. Whatsapp, the bane of my existence. I swear I get a handful of calls everyday related to Whatsapp.

The main issue, however, turned out to be that she wasn't connected to Wi-Fi on her phone. In fact, she had no idea of the *concept* of Wi-Fi.

After explaining her the basics on Wi-Fi, we go back to her computer to see if we can find information on it. However, the PC was linked via ethernet and it didn't have a Wi-Fi card installed, so no way to see the SSID or the password on Windows.

After almost 10 minutes of trying to see if she could see the SSID and password on her router, I gave up. I had 20 minutes before the line closed for the day and if she called back, she could get someone more impatient than me.

I decided to get in to her router settings by typing the IP in the browser. First time success, no password needed. We mess around a bit and there they are, the SSID and the network password (again, probably failing in compliance).

I get her to turn on the Wi-Fi on her phone, type the password and connect... Success. We were in.

We went to download Whatsapp and it asked for her account password. After a couple of minutes explaining the difference between the Wi-Fi password and her account password (from here distinguished between ""the one that starts in 88"" and ""the one without the spaces""), she types it in and Whatsapp is installed.

I help her set it up and then advised her to meet her friends, that know how to use it, and have them send messages so she can reply. 

She was very happy at the end of the ordeal and I left work happy and on time.

TL;DR: I was an advisor for 3 different companies, squeezed about 3 Introduction to Computer classes, failed compliance at least twice and spent 1h20 minutes on call because of bloody Whatsapp.",talesfromtechsupport

Little backstory first. I was fresh out of college and working in a third party call center. We mostly did off the shelf software support (mostly Office, Lotus Notes, Photoshop, etc) but could also do some vba and other coding. We had many clients including a bunch of Fortune 500s and some that may piss off taxpayers if they were allowed to know we were outsourced (think city in state x hires us in state y). Most of the time we were not allowed to say we were outsourced, which bring up different stories for a different day.

Suddenly hundreds and hundreds of customers are calling in because their computers are constantly rebooting. We all try the basics but soon word gets around that almost all of us are getting basically the same call in both of our locations. 

None of us know what is going on. We're remote so we can't exactly check hardware. We can't remote in due to constant reboots. Then our manager gets an email from McAfee. An update caused SVCHost.exe to be quarantined. They're working on a fix and tell us to  hold tight.

A couple hours later we get another email with a script we have to sideload on every machine. Only we didn't have any admin rights whatsoever. Every time a customer called we had to call their local admins and send them the script to push on their local machines. 

These calls lasted for 3 days. IIRC McAfee publicly stayed that only a small percentage of customers were affected. Based on the volume of calls to my company alone I assume the actual percentage was much much higher.

t3_dbbk5g,"The casual, and the black and white document.","This is a short but sweet one.

About 2-3 years ago the organization I work for hired a casual. Her primary role was not tech support, but during her quiet times she'd come over and help us out with the absolute basics of tech support for those who would walk in. Stuff like ""can you restart your machine and try again?"" and ""can you try going to google.com to make sure your internet is working?"".

One day the casual printed out the roster to keep by the desk, but she accidentally printed it in black and white. Rather than print it again in colour, she spent a good while colouring in the black and white roster with a yellow and green highlighter, checking her work against what was on the screen. When we noticed, we asked why she didn't print it out again but in colour. She said ""oh, I didn't think to do that"".

And that's why she only lasted a few months before not getting called back in.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_dak0nq,User buys a new phone and demands I set it up even though I'm on vacation,"I am the only I.T. support for a small company (35 people) so my job ranges from unlocking accounts to managing multiple networks.

Leading up to my vacation that started right after work on Friday I sent out two different emails to the whole company telling them I would be on vacation and only available for emergencies and please keep everything else until I return.

Three hours after I get home and start my vacation plans I get a call from one of the vice presidents. He had just bought a new phone on a whim and needed it setup with email and multi-factor authentication for applications we require it on. He needs this all done before Saturday afternoon because he has work that absolutely has to be done and he doesn't have his old phone anymore so he can't use that until I get back. Last time we set this up for him it took close to three hours because he refused to follow the directions I sent out and was mad I couldn't just remote into his phone and do it for him. I told him I'd send him the instructions as soon as I could get to a computer.

I sent him the instructions again (while very drunk) at 3 in the morning and he began texting immediately asking for more help. I fell asleep and woke up to texts ranging from 3 until 8 asking for help because he couldn't figure out my instructions. So now I've been talking to him for over two hours and loving this vacation.

t3_dalnh8,A lesson learnt.. Never go beyond your remit and cover your ass with paperwork!,"Years ago, I worked in support team for various gateway products including an email solution that was installed on various Unix platforms. It's a pretty awesome product, let's call it messagePure.

Now, this product had its own MTA and one or more server(s) with a milter on it so the install and set up normally required an administrator who knew what they were doing.

Roll on and this caller phones in and says that he had run out of disk space on a SAN that had 40GB. Well, this does sound excessive even for larger solutions so I went through the bread and butter stuff with him, yes what he said was verified, there were inodes left so where did space go?... It turned out that he had archiving enabled and was saving a copy of every mail that the policy touched. The simple solution was to clear down the archive as it was a number of years old at this point.

We cleared down the oldest archives and logs with him while he was on the phone and got the solution working again. I then suggested logrotate to keep the space under control. He had never used it before and asked me to ssh in and set it up for him, which I did as its a simple setup. He was happy and I got a 5/5 for the ticket.

6 months later they had another issue and the user blamed me as I  ""must have touched something"". I had no RMA so got yelled at for logging in when the customer asked me to.

I have **never gone past my remit after that** (for the record logrotate in a Unix tool, nothing my company supplied).

Now when I hear ""can't you just..""  I remember that experience and just say ""nope, thats your admin's job""

TLDR: customer asked to go above and beyond and then blamed me for other issues months later.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_dafezu,"Sorry, but my wand is in the shop","  

A while back, I worked in tech support for an accounting firm. I was the in-office support person, while the other two support team members managed the domain and network remotely. It cut down on a lot of pointless distractions if there was someone in the physical office to handle the standard user issues, so the other two techs could focus on other critical tasks like security, compliance, migration, setting up new hires, archiving and deleting inactive accounts, etc. The firm wasn’t small, but it still was closer to “mom and pops” than being one of the giant firms (only 40-50 users). It was a nice place. Everyone was friendly and on a first-name basis with each other, even the higher ups. While they were all very nice, not everyone was technologically inclined. Guess that’s why I had job there.

This incident occurred around the time after we had migrated over to Office 365 and right after we enabled MFA for all users. The only user with a problem was one of the managers. He was leaving the company soon (amicably and his choice) and only had a few weeks left, so of course he would be the user with the crisis. It had to be the guy with one foot out the door that has a red alert that demands my full attention. Kind of like being forced to repair a Win 7 machine the same day the new Win 10 laptops arrive and are being distributed. Pointless and unsatisfying. After all, without the user who witnessed my labors, who will sing tales of the mighty battles waged by those of us who work in tech support?

Anyway, the manager’s account kept getting locked due to repeated invalid login attempts. We traced the issue back to his phone. He had a phone that looked like it had barely survived a horror movie…cracked screen, chipped plastic, mystery stains, etc. (FYI, he ate at his desk everyday with the phone out, so the mystery was whether a stain was bacon grease from a burger or oil from a pepperoni pizza slice.)

It seemed that even though we had set up his phone correctly for the change, his phone was sending the old login info anyway as quickly and as annoyingly as a kid that keeps repeating “are we there yet?” on a long road trip. Seriously, this phone was hammering his email account every 30 seconds with a wrong password, so no wonder the account kept locking as soon as we unlocked it. I tried the usual steps of checking and re-entering the correct settings and user info. I tried deleting and re-adding the email account. We even reset his account to without MFA to see if the phone would work correctly (which it did not).

The manager was becoming very frustrated. He kept saying, “You have to fix my phone! I need to be able to get emails! I can’t get onto my computer!” (His network login of course locked with his email, so he also couldn’t log on to his computer. He could do literally nothing until it was resolved. Welcome back accounting Flintstones style!)

When the standard fixes failed, I started asking more questions about the phone. Turns out he had been experiencing problems with a lot of apps since the last phone OS update. I realized the update probably didn’t install correctly when during my questions he revealed that he ran the OS update while the phone wasn’t connected to a power source (even though you’re supposed to have it plugged in for an update…..says so on the update screen and everything. And yes, he manually told the update to proceed anyway while unplugged). 

He had started the update, the phone died, he charged it, and the phone seemed to continue with the update upon charging/rebooting. Likely culprit identified!

For clarification, the company had a BYOD policy option, so it was his phone and he controlled the update process. I’d have preferred company provided devices for more control and tighter security, but it wasn’t my choice. We just changed some default settings for security and installed some additional security software, but other than that, it was still his phone.

You’d think that finding the culprit meant a solution was at hand, but this is where it got interesting. I tell him we should backup the phone, reset the OS to factory, and import his data back to the device after doing a fresh update. He looks horrified at the suggestion….and I mean the “you just ran over my puppy in front of me” horrified.

Manager: “You can’t do that! Stop!”

Me: “I haven’t done anything yet and why not? Don’t worry. We’ll make a local backup as well as one to the cloud, so you don’t need to worry about losing any data if that’s your concern.”

This is when manager tells me that he and his wife are in the middle of a very nasty divorce. I felt for the guy, as he was otherwise a nice guy and obviously under a lot of stress from his personal life. He says he has texts on his phone from her that he needs as “evidence” (evidence of what? I didn’t ask). I told him that we could preserve the texts, take screenshots, back them up to a service, and/or even print them out, scan them, and email pdf copies on the texts for him (and printed copies might even be easier for presenting during divorce proceedings).

Manager: “No! No! NO! Her lawyers will say they’re fake! I need them on the phone as they are, not some copy! I can’t risk it!”

Me: “Ok, well, maybe we could delete your email from the phone. You have your laptop, so you can still check email when at home.”

Manager: “No, I need it on the phone too! I don’t want to keep my laptop open at home, so you have to fix it!”

Me: “We’ve tried everything we can with this phone besides restoring it to factory. Since your phone is in such bad shape physically, how about a new one?”

Manager: “No, I need this phone!”

Me: “Maybe we could email the boss and request a used smartphone. Some of them are pretty cheap secondhand, and it would only be for you to use for a few weeks. We can express one and take it down to \[the company’s mobile provider\] store for a new sim card/number on the company account. Your personal phone could remain untouched and as-is, and you’d have a separate company phone for the email.”

Manager: “No, I don’t want to carry two phones! I’ll forget one! Hurry up and fix it! I need to get onto my computer and do my accounting stuff \[I don’t remember the actual jargon he used\] for the client NOW!”

Me: “Well, could you at least turn your phone off until we discuss a solution, so it stops hammering the email server? That’s the only way to unlock your account so you can get back on.”

Manager: “No! I have a kid and his school might call me with an emergency!” (I don’t know why he didn’t give his direct office line to the school for his contact info as well as his mobile.)

The manager was becoming increasingly frustrated and shot down every compromise or solution I had. I felt bad for the guy, but the more frustrated and unreasonable he got, the more my nerves were beginning to fray.

Manager just kept insisting: “Just fix my phone! Don’t delete anything! Don’t give me another phone! Don’t turn it off! Don’t remove the email! Just fix it! You’re IT! You have to fix it!”

Me: “I don’t know what you want. You keep saying fix it, but also don’t touch it, do anything to it, or make any changes of any kind. That’s not possible! It defies the laws of reality!”

After 30 minutes of his increasingly loud demand for the impossible, and with no reasonable compromise or solution accepted, I just began waving my hands over the phone to “summon the gods of tech support.” (Yes, I literally, began waving my hands over the phone and chanting because subtle sarcasm is not my strong suit.)

Me: “Oh mighty gods of tech support, lend me your power, I beg of you! Abracadabra! Hocus Pocus! Sim Sim Salabim and wonder twin powers activate! Ooga Booga! Evil Spirits Be Gone! The power of Cheez Whiz compels you!”

The manager just looks at me like I’ve completely lost my mind while I chanted.

Me: “It doesn’t seem to be working! We’re losing him! If only my wand wasn’t in the shop! I’m sorry, but we’ve done all we can. The rest is in God’s hands. He’s dead, captain.”

And with that, I just turned and walked out of his office.

Hey, I’m an 80’s kid, so when I decided to fake chant to make my point, I couldn’t help but give as many nods to my childhood as possible. I’m not sure if he got the specific references, but there was no missing my point. 

Half an hour later, he called me back in and had me remove the email account from his phone. Once he had calmed down after I'd left, he’d thought about it and decided he could keep his laptop open at home because he was only there for a few more weeks anyway. He started laughing and with a smile called me a jerk for putting on my “magic show.”

In the end, nothing too dramatic. No villains, no revenge, no arrests. Just a frustrated slightly tech challenged manager going through a rough patch. Not a bad guy, just expecting miracles….and me without my wand.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_dalg46,remotesupport the hard way,"First i know many will think i make this up or tell an old tale again, but this happend to me personally and is entirely true.Its freely translated and i tryed to recreate the conversation but it was very close to this:

senior owner of a small company and reg customer calls because of a problem with their server. we have no VPN in there so i asked him to make a remote connection.

since i knew he is usually does not work much, if anything at all, computer related thing i tried to talk him trough the process starting the remote client. But nothing i told him worked. already a long time in trying anything.

    ME: please go with the mouse on the remotesupport icon and double click.
    customer: what is that icon
    me: describing the icon and how it looks
    customer: searching,... a lot, oh yes i found it, is it like this (describing it)
    me:yes please move your mose onto that incon and double click it

but it didnt worked.oh well we had that before (people cannot double click as they are to slow yes this happens too)

    me: uhm try to click the left mousebutton twice in a row very fast, like click click click
    customer: (cliking the hell outta this mouse) nothing happens.
    me: really nothing?
    me: ok, please click with the right mouse button on the remotesupp. 
    icon you will see the menue. top option should be open do you see it
    
    customer: no, (reads menue one by one)
    me: ok please follow exactly as i say and do nothing in between or anticipate anything,
     just be my hand. 
    (users like to think for themself which is never good).......

\--- couple of minutes later (actually a lot), a few tries, still same menue, hold on he is reading the context menue of the desktop

    me: ok seem like you still clicking on the desktop and missing the icon, 
    please point the mousepointer exactly on that icon....

still no joy and i was thinking what could causing him not be able to click that icon, we go back and forth a bit then it hit me

    me: sir when you move your mouse do you see how the mouspointer moves
    customer: what mousepointer
    me: that white arrow, do you see it ?
    customer: (searching...processing information...) 
    oh yes i see it but when i put the mouse on it, it doesnt move.
    me: when you do what? how do you.....

Wait a second, WHAT?

    me: uhm, you hold your mouse on the pointer? on the monitor?
    customer: yes, ofc
    me: (holding onto my chair to not fall off) oh no,
     please move the mouse on the table you see the pointer moving...
    customer: oh....
    me: did you really hold your mouse on the monitor to click something?

t3_dah9xr,We broker her Laptop,"This is a old one but as it is some time ago i can just recall the highlights.

I used to work in the first level tech support line of a big name internetprovider company here in germany. There are so many stories. One of the more memoral stories is about an elderly lady who called us, because her internet didn´t work, but her landline, which was also from us did. Now if someone of a certain age is calling us, the first challenge is to find out WHAT the problem is. Not what caused it but what is currently wrong. So her internet is not working and she asked, if we can send one of our technicans out? Sadly i can´t put in a ticket for a technican in our system, without asking the usual questions first. How is the modem? Did she switched it off and on again. And all the other annoying questions everyone complains about. As most customers we have, she didn´t care to answer the questions and if i can just send out a technican because her internet isn´t working and this is what she is paying us for. And if i can´t do it maybe she should call the other ""big company name everyone in germany knows in bright pink"" and become a customer there? In the meantime i got a read of the modem and the line and everything seemed fine and dandy. Also as i said she still could call us over her landline. And suddendly she dropped the bomb. Her ""My laptopscreen is still black."" Again we are a internet provider. We don´t sell laptops or anything. So i asked again. 

Me: So it´s not your internet, but your laptop screen is black? 

She: Yes, it´s black, because my internet doesn´t work. And as you are my internet provider, it´s your fault. And you need to send a technican out to fix it.

Me: I can send a technican out if you want, but in this case we would need to charge you for it. We only provide our technicans for free, if our wire is broken.

She: Well it doesn´t work. And i am not paying for it. You are providing my internet. And as the screen is black, because of  your internet, this is the reason why it´s black. 

Me: I am sorry but this is not the reason why it´s black. Clearly the internet is working as we both are talking with each other. This means there is a signal. I sadly can´t support you for your blackscreen and recommend that you should bring your laptop to a repair shop. 

She: Well i will not bring my laptop again to a repair shop, i just brough it to one last week. I really should become a customer of ""company in bright pink and with a catchy tune"". They would send me a technican.

Me: Ma´am you can do it. But i am honest with you now, you saying that our service is responsibel for your black screen is like pointing at the street and blaming it for your car not starting. You told me now that you already had a problem in the past with your laptop and i am sorry but again, your internet has nothing do with it. If i send you a technican he will bill you. The end result was that we ended the call and me having talked 25 minutes about a problem with our service, which was not a problem.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_damanm,locking myself out on long distance,"Customer with many chain store, configuring a new master config for the stores VPNs.

for security reasons stores have only one vpn to main network. no access from the outside to a store.now ofc, since reconfig the VPN is touchy and used routers are potatoes (small stores with often only one computer so who cares) i usually setup a temporary acces to the router itself from the outside, reconfig the vpn and close it up right after.

but at this one, things are different. its behind a cable modem and for some reason that modem is not briding but masquerading. so no outside access without portforward on that router and i dont have its password, its 9pm so noone to ask.

    allright lets roll the dice, putting in router config, as testet and already 
    running on other identical stores.....

oups, router gone, connect gone, no reconnect. thing plays dead.now what. either wait till morning (they open to early for my taste) phonecall the sotre clerk, trying him to get remotesupport running, which will be hard as he wont have also no dns without VPN and possible no admin rights on his machine to reset the tcpip config...

hmm or lets try something else.

    phone call to the provider, finding that store, let him diagnose if router and modem is up - is up
    now lets try some convincing
    
    me: uhm look here is what i did, i need you do give me port forwarding on that router to this 
    port so i can remote in and undo my own damage.
    provider: we cant do that, we cant really verify who you are, you mgiht wanna try gain access
    me: shure, then again i would need to know the credentials, i just need 2 minutes, 
    or ive to drive 300km 
    me: i can even tell you the outside ip and everything, 
    provider: do you have access to the email that account is registered
    me: yea i do, just no clue on which that thing goes. that company has endless
     many mailboxes that could be used for this store, maybe even the former IT service company,
     can you tell me that email that was used
    provider: naa cant tell you that you have to know that
    me: uhm, shit, is it.... adress1,2,3,4.... 

we go back and forth, but thankfully he can kinda relate :)also i can feel his pity me trying to find out which mail the customer used,.. its a bit messy...

    provider: allright can you tell me some details, like which type of router, its ip,... 
    me:yea,..type of potatoe, type of custom firmware... ip uhm dont really know, 
    didnt setup that thing
    provider: allright i give you 2 minutes 

Bingo, releave.

he activated port forwarding, i remote in, and since i still need to reconfigure that thing and not only get it back up, try to troubleshoot it in 2 minutes  and reset config.....

many fast clicks and types later its backup, provider deactivates portforwarding again.

&amp;#x200B;

turns out, while all stores have identical routers and firmware, there are minor version differences in a very few.now i had a faulty option in the vpn main config (something about agressive reconnect and reducing timeout time) that was simply ignored in the later versions, but trow up the minor ealier one. vpn service simply didnt start because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

bottom line,

\-never rely on errorhandling trough different versions of software, even minor ones, you never know

\-check your logs in the lab that they are absoltuly error free, working is not enough, even or specially its late

\-to much security is not always a good thing, sometimes a hole saves the day

t3_da8z1g,Tech support can be really helpful if you aren't rude to us,"Today I got a call from a user that needed the latest version of iTunes on his computer. But it wasn't available from our software store. He asked me if, since he had an admin PC, he could uninstall the iTunes from us and downloaded it on his own.

Here's the crux, we don't have support on admin PC's. But I figured a simple yes or no would be fine. I guessed the answer was yes, but to verify I told the user I would be right back and put him on hold. I walked over to our coaches and asked if my guess was correct. They said yes, *but* the lack of support to admin PC's goes so far that I can't tell him that.

I return to the user and inform him that sadly our support doesn't cover his PC, and it apparently goes so far that I can't answer this question.

The user sighs and asks if at least could help him uninstall the iTunes from our store, because he can't find the uninstall option in Software center (where all our software is found). I inform him that I am afraid I can't do that either.

User: ""So you can't help me get rid of a program *you* installed on my PC?""  
Me: ""Sadly, no.""

The user was quiet for a few seconds and then this conversation followed:  
User: ""... Say I was using *another PC*. How would I go about uninstalling a program?""  
Me: ""... Well... If you are using another PC I would tell you to open Control panel and go to uninstall programs. But this is *only* for other PC's of course. PC's that aren't admin PC's.""  
User: ""Of course. Of course. I would never do this on an admin PC. I am using this other PC next to it. I promise.""  
Me: ""Good. We wouldn't want to break the rules for the support.""  
User: ""Heavens, no. I would never ask you to do something like that.""

I then ended the call and split the call in to two cases. One for the iTunes thing where he was denied support. And a separate one where he asked my about how to uninstall a program on a nondescript computer.

I have been in similar situations before. Situations where I could have used some loophole to help a user. But the user had been so rude and unpleasant that I chose not to. So it was nice to talk to someone who understood that I didn't make the rules.",talesfromtechsupport

This particular ticket was from somebody in payroll who was complaining that their desktop couldn't print. When I arrived at the person's office, He explained that he's trying to send this document to the department printer which was down the hall but it won't come out. He then explained that this is a sensitive document so he is going to leave me in the office and wait by the printer so he could grab the print out before someone would see it. I sat down at his chair and looked at the document. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was an excel file that contained a table with columns that looked somewhat like this:
&amp;nbsp;
First Name
&amp;nbsp;
Last Name
&amp;nbsp;
Salary

followed by hundreds of records of ALL COMPANY EMPLOYEES.  
I took a few seconds to look through the data. I was particularly interested in the people who were working in my department, but as I was scrolling through, I saw a lot of information. I was tempted but decided not to save the document to a network share. I fixed the printer issue, checked that the guy got it and left.

From that day forward, as I was roaming around the building, when I saw people walking in front of me, I was also seeing this imaginary bubble with their salary figure right above them...",talesfromtechsupport

t3_da9has,"We Can't Do That, I Don't Know Why","We'll call $TeamMember1 the target of my frustration.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently joined a company on the  team of process/product owners. This is a fairly new team so there are no documents or guides for how we should all work together outside of standard project documentation. Recognizing this, our team leader advised us to work together on getting to know how each-other works and finding ways to standardize things like request forms, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am the new guy being that I came from outside of the company. I am also the most technical since I came from a system administrator role. Plus, I love tech and feel it is grossly under-considered in process/business structuring. Thus, I have been informally recognized as ""the tech guy"" on the team.

&amp;#x200B;

To kick off our project we scheduled an internal demo of PowerApps by one of the AVPs who works closely with our leader. I had a week or two of time before the meeting. So, decided to dig in myself and begin learning how it works with flow and Sharepoint to prepare for any dev questions I was struggling with. 

The meeting starts and $TeamMember1 has not shown up because of an emergency she's dealing with. No biggie. I set the scope of the meeting and he begins walking through some templates and generally having an open forum discussion with us. I bring up that our Sharepoint is an on-prem copy and begin asking how he's managed to develop in the on-prem site without offloading to our App-Dev team who is offshore and sucks balls.

&amp;#x200B;

About 15 minutes into the meeting $TeamMember1 comes barreling into the room apologizing profusely and blatantly frazzled. We assure her it's fine and I continue my discourse with the AVP. He mentions that there is a gateway already set up and we agree a follow up for him to walk me through how he set it up for his team would be ideal. Immediately after, $TeamMember1 jumps in and says something along these lines:

""Hey, sorry guys, I know I was late and don't really know what we are talking about. This tech stuff sounds like you're talking Chinese to me. But, $Voxmanns, I just want to remind you that the point of this meeting was for us to meet as a team and learn about PowerApps and how we can use it for this project. $AVP we are..."" and goes for an additional 10 minute explanation of the ENTIRE scope of the project after calling me out in the meeting as if I was off topic and had not already done this. 

That's fine. I can give a pass on this and just say I would have done it differently for sure. I bite my tongue through the explanation and let her have some discourse with the AVP without interrupting to let her catch up. This is when I learned she's one of those people who just doesn't have an understanding of how flexible modern technology is - asking very simple functionality questions like ""Can we log notes"" and things along those lines. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, we got to a point where we were discussing documentation and adding attachments. From my short time with PowerApps and Sharepoint I had read that attachments aren't always great since Sharepoint items aren't structured to function as a document library. So, seeking a solution I asked the AVP ""Hey, do you think it's better for us to keep separate documents and update PowerApps separately (double work but separation) or do we go directly through PowerApps and use screens as separate documents?""

Before he can answer, $TeamMember1 butts in and says ""No, they need to be separate."" I can do one, I can do plenty from seniors and superiors. I have little patience for my teammate interrupting me twice in the same meeting because they don't get the picture. The following exchange occurred between her and I:  


$Voxmanns: ""Why do they need to be separate?"" (with a firm but polite tone)

$TeamMate1: ""We need some documents signed off by SVPs, present them as PDFs, etc. We need to have the document separate from the app.""

$Voxmanns: ""So, PowerApps can't do that?""

$TeamMate1: ""Well, it's an application to be used for forms and organizing. And I know what you do is a little bit different than what me and (other teammates) do but at least for our process we need to have the documents separate."" (She likes playing the 'you're different' card on me)

$Voxmanns: ""Okay, so we need document versions of the form. Are you saying PowerApps can't do that?""

$TeamMate1: ""Well, I haven't used it very much so I-""

$Voxmanns: ""Okay,"" turning to the AVP ""Can PowerApps export to PDF or other documents?""

$AVP: ""Yeah, PowerApps can export"" and goes on to say the importance of mulling ideas over and over to find the best way forward (I am guessing he saw my frustration).

&amp;#x200B;

Admittedly, I need to work with a thicker skin, or at least hide it better. Asking the ""Do you know that"" question seemed to work and will hopefully work in the future with her. It is just incredibly difficult to work with a teammate who has to assert their control and does not consider anything they don't understand as a reasonable solution to explore. Hey, totally open to any stories or tactics you all use when dealing with these types of people - it's definitely one of my weak points. Felt nice to shut down the document rebuttal, though! I'll call it a draw for now haha.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_daa21q,Tech Support to Tech Support,"**SETTING:**  
Mid 1990s at a large, multi-national cutting-edge high-tech company

**BACKSTORY:**  
We had introduced networked PCs for all engineers and most technicians in our division. We were provisioning them and supporting them ourselves because corporate IT didn't exist yet. Because of the primitive nature of networking for MS Windows, we were using DEC Pathworks and our DEC VAX 11/780 mainframe as a server for file shares. And DEC's version of email.

This DEC VAX was the computer that supervised the entire, very sensitive, very high-tech research and development factory.  This factory operates 7x24. Now, we operated this computer to be ultra-reliable because factory downtime cost 1.5 million USD per hour. We had only one scheduled annual warm-down for 12 hours between Christmas and New Years when the factory was idling.

Then corporate started putting together our first IT department made up of PC enthusiasts with that wild-west frontier spirit of that era in computing. Along with the development of corporate IT, they rolled out cc:Mail as the corporate email solution.  

Now, IT didn't have any presence at our campus as we had been self-sufficient up to that point. So there were no IT servers on our campus. But they needed some file shares for the cc:Mail databases that made the application operate.  So, we created several file-shares on our VAX to support their cc:Mail services. (Each database/fileshare could support only a few hundred users).  That worked pretty well except that cc:Mail was rather flaky and had a rather high failure rate.

Now, IT's solution to everything was to simply reboot. Which is fine for an end-user client machine. But you can't go around willy-nilly rebooting servers where users have open documents, etc.  But the IT of that era hadn't yet developed that kind of customer-centric mindset. So that is the back-story that led up to... 

**THE PLAYERS:**  
Me and Corporate Help Desk (CHD)

**THE INCIDENT:**  
*One hot August afternoon I was building new client systems and answering our Help Desk. The fateful call comes in.*

Me: ""Hello, {department} PC Help Desk, how can we help you?""

CHD: ""Hello, this is the corporate help desk. We are having problems with one of the cc:Mail databases on your campus. To clear the problem, can you re-boot the server where that database is provisioned?""

*Now, I had never had the CHD call us. Usually, it was the other way around, I had to call THEM for something.*

Me: ""Well, that database is served from our factory mainframe and we can't just reboot it whenever we please.""

CHD: ""But what will it take to reboot that server?""

Me: ""The next scheduled re-boot of that server is Christmas day. Would you like to hold?"" 

*Yes, I admit that was rather snarky of me and I wanted to see what was their reaction. We had VERY different concepts of operating network services.*

CHD: *Long silent pause. I thought maybe the call had dropped.  But finally they replied:* ""Well, I guess we will have to find some other way to clear the problem.  Thank you.""

I like to think the I gave them a little encouragement to develop more user-friendly ways of handling problems like this.

**AFTERMATH**  
A few years later, management decided to revert to IT-supported office computing services rather than rolling our own.  But on OUR terms. We had a critical list of 20-30 Best Known Methods (BKMs) and SOP that we had developed to keep computing and networking in their place, as aids to doing business, rather than distractions and hindrance to getting the work done.  

We met with the corporate IT people and presented our list. Their reaction to the items on the list ranged from mystified to horrified. They proceeded to cross off almost every point and argued that they couldn't possibly do business like that.  But we insisted, and it took almost 2 years to transition from our office computing environment to the corporate IT provided solution.

A few months after the transition period, our division had moved into a new campus, we were operating with IT supported office networking and computing.  And then corporate IT proudly announced their new office computing initiative.  Oddly enough, it contained almost exactly the list that we had originally presented to them.

There are some sub-plots in this scenario that I will post as their own stand-alone stories that should amuse many readers here.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_da933h,"Back in the day, part of my job was to liaison with government reps when receiving warranty claims for military electronics returns.","So here's how it worked: These incredibly complex ""black boxes"" for military aircraft would be returned from the field with tags affixed by the (fucking awesome) local repair crews explaining the deficiency. These guy knew their shit I tell you!  

The shipping containers were always opened with a company rep (me) and a gov't rep (we'll call him Tito) present.

Tito was kind of a dick. He would always look to find a way to ensure the defect was covered under warranty. I get it, I'm a taxpayer too.

The first one I recall, we open the shipping container and remove the shoebox size ""black box"" and there is a clear and present footprint on the top of the device. Someone had actually used it as a foot stool.  
Me: ""Warranty exclusion.""  
Tito: ""Are you kidding me?""  
Me: ""Tito, show me where in the documentation is foot stool mentioned?""  
Tito relented. ;)  

Another one. Remember these are highly complex electronic devices:   
Me: ""The field report tag reads, 'water observed leaking from device', exclusion.""  
Tito: ""Are you kidding me?  
Me: ...&lt;eye roll&gt;

It was always fun dealing with Tito. He would try and shut down our operation just to flex his muscle. We were not a shitbag outfit. Far from it. Almost everyone I worked with understood that what we were building was protecting our boys and girls in the air. And we fucking took it seriously. (We had times where one of our 'things' went to shit and everyone worked around the clock until it was right. We understood the job, we understood the risks to our Flyboys/girls and dammit, we fucking took it seriously!)

One of the last times I saw Tito, he was in the middle of trying to shut down the entire production line for what amounted to a very minor deficiency. (The kind of thing that would normally be caught and corrected using our typical procedures, which were pretty fucking impressive!) His boss, uncharacteristically, in the middle of the entire workcenter, with everyone in that workcenter in earshot berated the shit out of him in his heavy Italian accent, ""Tito, you don havea the fuckin authority, to shuta down this whole a fuckina line.""  Apparently, boss man had had enough.   
It was a good day. :)

t3_d9xjp7,How a desk phone took down an entire office,"This is my first story, though it happened a while ago. 

Me | client

Client: I'm calling about our entire office being down 

Me: has this just happened or is it an existing ticket?

Client: Just happened!

Me: ok so let's check the physical side of things - where are you now? (I start pinging the wan ip which is up)

Client: I'm in front of a desk phone that has a red x on it and something about no dhcp

Me: ok so I'm getting a response from your modem there so internet is working, might be something inbetween your computer and the modem. Can we go into the server room

Client: ok, btw, I came into setup 2 new users and I can't hang around. I've got 2 hours to do this in

Me: we're handling it

Client: I'm in the server room, what am I looking for

Me: judging from the site photos you should have some switches that connect all your computer's to the modem to get internet. Are the switches on?

Client: what are switches? Can you just send someone because the directors are starting to yell?

Me: I need to verify some things before my manager will send someone (I didn't mention call out fees but I did mention we don't have a pool of helpful garden gnomes that have nothing to do, because they're currently at client sites) I've sent you a photo circling the switches

Client: ok so now what

Me: are the switches on?

Client: yes

So we get her laptop plugged directly into each switch. One switch doesn't provide her laptop with the web bits

Me: ok this is the troublesome switch. Can you pull the power on it

Client: ok one sec

(In reality it took longer)

It's powered up and still no change. We unplugged some cables and plugged them back in and it felt like I was starting to burn time

Now I won't go into detail, but basically I was escalating, then that was getting escalated, all the while the customer is complaining about it not working, how they're freaking out... at one point they asked how they could work :

Me: you can make sure the printer is in a wall port that goes to the second...

Client: too hard. Can't you just get it to work

Me: *pause* yep, just the way I told you. Or you can stand directly in front of the switch

Client: I'll stand, this couldn't have happened at a worse time

So I'm getting push back from my escalation point, being asked questions like ""have they messed with anything on the switch"", and checking the trunk ports between switches... all valid but still frustrating when I'm trying to placate a site contact.

While my tech manager is getting ready to go, I'm asking some last ditch questions like ""So when you setup the new users at their desks what did you plug/unplug"" and as she's going around having a fiddle, stuff starts coming back online

I put the on-site visit on hold, tell my manager, and I'm going through the checks when my manager busts into the call and asks what she unplugged

""The phone""

Manager: ok you'd plugged one phone into two wall ports. The port with the computer goes to the computer and the other port goes into the wall

Then I recalled at the start of the conversation how she was setting up users with their desk phones and docking stations. She'd created a loop

t3_da8z2l,The (Friday) night I bricked a server (The Beehive - Part 1),"Per popular choice on [the previous tale](https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/d9idlt/we_will_contact_your_shortly_a_game_of_clue/), today's tale will be the beginning of The Beehive arc, which should be a three-parter.

This tale takes place in the end of my career at _$agency_. I was now one of the oldest there, with same _$boss_ and _$pm_ from before but now supported with _$kohai1_ (and _$kohai2_ later) for dev work, and many other marketing/design colleagues.

------

The first time I met _$queen_ was on a minor project during training, I found odd that the Head of Digital Marketing was there, but she made relevant SEO remarks on our delivered product. But I realized this was a cover to meet with _$boss_ to discuss a big upcoming project, despite us being miles away from home and the clock being 7pm.

Said project is another story I wasn't involved much at first since we were not chosen for the dev part. But when it got FUBARed we took over but that doesn't deserve a tale of its own.

I compare organizations with shareholders as beehives. Like every company, they need to output honey and keep the hive healthy and workers busy. But inevitably, the beekeepers take their share and split hives as they please, they might have feelings for their bug slaves but the honey must flow. So they buy queen bees and just drop them in the hive to be accepted by the workers.

Since the previous six figure failure, _$queen_ was moved to a new company but weirdly enough in the same market and recently acquired by a trust fund, still as Head of Digital Marketing. Maybe somebody had a friend high up ?

The other moving part of the Beehive tale is _$hostingProvider_ which is also a beehive of sort. Despite being a local company, they had been acquired by a much larger US based group. _$hostingProvider_ was mostly telco but with a solid sales team of all-flavours-of-EU speaking bees, so they also provided hosting services.

We already worked with them for the same minor project I mentioned previously, so the pattern was quite clear when _$queen_ asked us to switch from their current hosting provider to _$hostingProvider_.

We were knee-deep in our audit of their current ecommerce infrastructure and multiple brands they managed, which in itself was ""funny"" since the first meeting we had was about the revamp of their corporate website.  
_$boss_ and _$queen_ at it again.  
A deal was struck to employ us for 2 days a week starting now, mostly to fix all their issues with _$bigEcommerceCms_.  
So it was a another fun surprise when we were asked to handle the switch to _$hostingProvider_, but come on, ""you already know them and how they work, and they know how you work !"".  

It was true we had another unrelated client with a _$bigEcommerceCms_ instance hosted by _$hostingProvider_, so _$boss_ and _$queen_ must have rejoiced. But this is the tale of ""The 10 pages requirement you regret you billed us 1 hour"", we had total control of the sales and dev environment, not here.

---

Now the crux of today's tale is that _$previousProvider_ was also the agency responsible for everything technical up to now, so they were pretty pissed at _$queen_. This was shown by giving them and thus us a hard deadline to move everything before they shut their machine.

And we were talking about at least 4 instances of _$bigEcommerceCms_ in various conditions and versions, multiple static website from years old HTML pages to Flash based one, all around a dozen of domains. The only solace in this is that they already had moved their email to Office 365, so we didn't have to think about that.

So the marketing bees were harassing us with tickets about their needs of custom stats export, years old bug they thought could be finally be fixed and various questions and sales operations, and at some point I told _$pm_  we had to focus on the switch and nothing else.

Given the deadline, this was already eating up their 2 allocated days. Despite the years, management was not much more efficient so the deadline was rapidly visible even behind the mountain that was our backlog. _$Kohai1_ was still in training for _$bigEcommerceCms_ so I assigned him the small stuff and handled everything else including most of the project management work.

Up to now _$queen_ had been mostly bugging us with technical questions about _$bigEcommerceCms_ performance and modules since she wasn't up to speed with their brands and catalog. And having a good chat with her _$hostingProvider_ sales team friend. Despite our now paused infra audit, she took the decision to order a load-balanced set of machines : 2 prod machines behind a load balancer, 1 for global db and assets storage and 1 for preprod needs.

Now mind you this was not our other client setup, the first time we had a load-balanced infra, and the only _$hostingProvider_ technician familiar with both _$bigEcommerceCms_ and the foul language we speak was US-based and half a day away. 

Oh and they used the worst ticketing system I've ever seen and we were second-grade users since not directly client of the mother-ship company.

Now 5000 signs in, you have the full context for this tale and future parts. I wont leave you without what the title promised :  

__The (Friday) night I bricked a server__

----

Since non switch-related issues were still actively pushed all week, I arrived Friday with merely a plan, an energy drink, and the assurance everybody had been briefed on how the ball was supposed to roll.

The morning was spent smoking the bees and reminding them to end their business by noon before downtime. Afternoon was spent copying _$bigEcommerceCms_ instances and other websites from _$pissedPreviousHostingProvider_.  
Of course _$queen_ wasn't happy we couldn't use the downtime to slip a patch or two, but the custom CRM integrations was full of hard coded paths merely not yet detected by our audit and she forgot some website were hosted elsewhere than on _$pissedPreviousHostingProvider_. Luckily they had the credentials, so on the list it goes. 

So it was already 4pm when everything was OK on the preprod machine despite the config being far from what our other combo of _$bigEcommerceCms_@_$hostingProvider_

I asked _$queen_ on the phone to verify all preprod versions :

&gt; _$me_ : Is everything OK to you ? Instances are perfect copies before downtime, so all orders of this morning are accounted for.  
&gt; _$queen_ : yeah but _$shittyStaticSite_ is an old version, and our shareholders are reviewing all of our domains so _pls fix it ASAP_

I had 4 websites full of honey not live at 4.30pm on a friday when I called _$pissedPreviousHostingProvider_ who gave us the previous SFTP access :

&gt; _$me_ : Hi $pissedTechnician, _$queen_ is telling me $domain is invalid, could you look at your config ?  
&gt; _$weekendAwaitingTechnician_ : (After a few minutes) Yeah your access was linked to a previous vhost folder, our bad.  
&gt; _$me_ : Thanks I got it, I'm sorry to ask but when are you leaving ?  
&gt; _$cleaningDeskTechnician_ : in about 30 min, why ?  
&gt; _$me_: Just in case anything happens...  
&gt; _$pissedTechnician_ : You know our deadline is set in stone right ? And is today. We won't host anything on Monday even if you ask nicely or with honey. (_Thank $queen for that you fool_)  
&gt; _$faunaHatingFool_ : Yeah I know, just 30min and after that I'm on my own.

Luckily during the week I had time to tweak my previous bash script responsible for copying instances of _$bigEcommerceCms_ and automatically adjust some server/db/cms settings to handle Prod VS Preprod. 

It was a beauty of cobbled together variables representing the multiple machines (Prod being 2 IPs + 1 shared storage and Preprod 1 IP + same storage) and databases, and I was very proud that it could be launched from any machine to another and `rsync/ssh` would gently do its job.

Each website was a parameter of the script, along with a keyword for source and one for destination. I didn't test machine to machine copy, but I was confident my gigantic switch to generate machine related variables would work.

Now that everything was OK on Preprod at 5pm, I used the script to copy _$shittyButNowCorrectStaticWebsite_ to please _$queen_, and it worked flawlessly, from Preprod to both Prod machines. All according to keikaku all I had to do was copy everything to Prod machines and ask for DNS modification.

As I was preparing to copy _$bigEcommerceCms_ instances, _$boss_ and _$pm_ comes by and asks me if everything is alright. I rant about _$queen_ and _$currentlyAtThePubTechnican_ warning and tells them this should be the yearly instance of Friday deployment they'll pay overtime. They laugh and leave, everything is OK and I hit Enter on my third monitor since _$kohai2_ had not yet stole it.

Now all commands were encapsulated in SSH commands for them to work on any machine, and verbose so that I could have an ETA on operation. And I didn't like the currently rolling folders of my ""delete before copy"" operation so I canceled it quickly. I realized they didn't mention my vhosts at all, but much more close to root folders.

I open my 100% correct script that previously worked for _$staticWebsite_ to check the operation :

    rm -rfv /$Folder    
    cp -Rv /$Folder

This is of course a dramatization of the script, but the keenest among will see that `/$Folder`is a very dangerous construct.

Because sure enough, I launched my script without specifying the final parameter of destination since I was distracted. Therefore $Folder is empty, and the SSH connecting to localhost. 

__I've just `rm -rf /`ed my preprod server I spent the day crafting.__ 

Thanks _$boss_, thanks _$queen_, thanks _$hostingProvider_ and their custom folder config which required me to change how folders were concatenated.

_____

I was alone, I could have shouted. But the cold sweat of my greener days never came. The _$senpai_ of my previous tale was long gone, I had long since took its place.

Bricking a machine was also not my first rodeo of this kind, so I didn't chastise much of _$Kohai1_ when he `rm -rf`ed his preprod vhost and all associated backups (we grabbed from offsite), or later _$kohai2_ when he `chmod 7XX`ed his cloud machine (we reinstalled in 5 min).

_$Kohai1_ chose anger and spent the week ruminating his mistake. _$Kohai2_ was green and spent 10 min frozen in fear hidden behind his wall of monitors before calling for help.

I therefore transcended my exhausted mortal body to grab the title of Sensei with my bare hands, attaining peace. I floated among lotuses and no bees were in sight.

Not a single thought of rage or regret passed upon me, no doubt in my skills and what the future was holding.

I must say this was a profound personal experience since I was on a spiritual path for some time to cope with my environment. I'm not ashamed of my blunder, and I'm proud of how I handled the consequences despite the madness around me. The mark of a truly desperate professional.

----    

On the mortal plane, I just sighed :

    $ root@preprod : ls -al
    $ root@preprod : ls command not found   

Yep, I'm fucked. Machine is bricked.

I call _$queen_ :

&gt; _$me_ : Hey _$queen_, don't worry if _$staticWebsite_ is no longer online, I've hit a pothole and need time to fix it up.  
&gt; _$queen_ : Nothing major I hope ? I'm heading home so here's my personal number.  
&gt; _$me_ : I'll keep you posted and will call you to handle DNS on your side.  

I texted _$boss_ and _$pm_ as well.

All I had to do was re-copy everything manually from their source. Some stuff could be salvaged from Preprod via `scp`, and the autoconfig part of my workflow was a sub-script I could trigger manually. _$pissedHosting_ didn't cut our access yet, maybe they felt guilty for that vhost.

It was 10.30pm when I called back _$queen_ :

&gt; _$me_ : Everything is copied on both machines, here's the load balancer IP again. You do your DNS magic.  
&gt; _$queen_ : Thanks, but I can't leave without giving you my utmost gratitude. No company has gone this kinda of length for us before, I know I was making the right choice picking you. Don't worry, all the shareholders will know your effort, and I won't forget it.  
&gt; _$me_ : Thanks, but right now I need to eat something. See you on Monday for postmortem.  

The keenest among you will sure have picked that _$queen_ was in charge of DNS, not the IT department. And during the whole story, was much more tech-savy than your run-of-the-mill marketing bee. This will of course bode well for the future.

I get back from seeing a user and one of the new devs calls me over, saying he's just found a bug, and he sounds really excited. He's only been here a few weeks but is integrating really well, so I'm a little surprised that he's so zealous about this. 



I wander over to his station to see what it is, and he starts pointing at his screen. I can't see anything that looks out of place in our system until a literal bug walks across his screen. 



A very funny little joke, but nothing I haven't seen before so I prepare to get on with my day. Then I realise the bug is _in_ his monitor. He takes a screenshot to prove it isn't some kind of overlay, and wipes his finger over it. 



That's a new one on me.

t3_da0kvn,So... can we just keep clicking ok?,"A few weeks ago we received a ticket about a department having trouble connecting a medical device to the software on their desktop. I can't troubleshoot the medical device (biomed department does that), but I can troubleshoot the software and hardware on the computer, so I head down to take a look.

When I walked in there were 2 users staring at the screen, just waiting. I introduce myself and they thank me for coming and start explaining how they need this to work and it's not working. They're stressed out and need this working now for a patient that will be coming soon.

I sit down and have them show me the software and the error they're getting. They show me and explain what it's supposed to do that it's not doing, then they continue to stand right behind me hovering and watching over my shoulder.

I try to ignore their hovering and see that it is a COM error. The software can't see the device at the assigned port. They have a serial cable that connects the device to a serial to USB adapter that plugs into the computer. 

So I check the settings in the software, find the port number it needs to be, and launch device management. I don't see the device under the COM port at all, so I begin checking the connections. While I'm unplugging and reconnecting each connection they're telling me how they've tried that already and it didn't help. I just nod and say I'm just going through my checklist. Everything is secure and it's not showing up, so I try moving the USB to another port as they tell me they've already tried too.

It's still not showing up, so I try removing the serial cable and plugging the medical device directly into the serial to USB adapter. Bingo. The COM port is now showing up, but is the wrong number. No problem. I change the port number, launch the software, and it works.

They cheer (softly, but I'm not exaggerating. This department is easily excitable) and begin praising me and ask what was wrong. I explain that it looks like the serial cable is bad and recommend they get a new one. We don't keep those in our stock room, but I tell them we can order one on their behalf if they need us to. They thank me, say they can take care of it and send me on my way.

I close out the ticket and move on thinking this is the end of it. But, of course it's not.

Yesterday morning I get a page for a high priority ticket from the department. I'm reading through the page and see my name specifically mentioned and one of the users from before. I open the ticket on my phone and make a note that I'm on my way. It was only 10 minutes before I normally leave, and I was already finished getting ready so I just left early. 

I get there and head straight to the department fully expecting to show up and see them trying the same thing as before. I walk in and no one is around to meet me for this ""high priority"" issue. I look at the setup and see that they are trying to use the serial cable again, but this time they're using it with a different medical device. As I'm debating calling the user she walks in and sees me.

She's explaining what it's doing and what should be happening as she logs in to the computer to show me. She hops up to let me sit down and I snag a screenshot of the error to attach to the ticket. It was a long error so I'm reading through it as she hovers and is trying to tell me what she wanted to do but she didn't want to break it so she just waited for me to get there. 

The error was saying it would take over 8 hours to transfer the logs, because there were over 1800 communication errors from the data transfer. It identifies it as an issue with the serial cable as well. I explain, again, that the serial cable is bad and that's what caused the error. I also explain that these transfer errors most likely mean that pieces of the information on the device are being lost during the transfer.

""Well, can we just click 'ok' at the bottom there and continue?"" She asks, pointing to the button at the bottom of the error.

""Sure, we can try it and see what happens."" I tell her as I click ""ok"" and see it go on to the next step instead of closing the program.

Naturally, she gets very excited and wants to keep going. I slowly follow her instructions, taking time to read each step for any errors or warnings. We get to the data transfer screen where she can select which of the recorded sessions she wants to transfer and print. We try it, and she says the graph looks right and prints it out.

""Great! Well it looks like it's working again. So.. can we just continue to click 'ok' and ignore that error?""

I stare at her for a moment processing the fact that she either forgot what I just told her about the cable or thinks it's not a big deal. ""No, I wouldn't recommend doing that. This cable is going bad and there is a chance that parts of those tests you recorded aren't getting transferred. You could be missing seconds from several parts of these tests and I don't know what effect that has on these results. I highly recommend getting in touch with biomed today to see if he can help you get a new cable for this.""

""Oh, okay then."" She sounds like she still doesn't understand why this is an issue, but asks me about the biomed guy to confirm she knows who I am talking about so she can get in touch with him.

Hopefully she actually gets it replaced this time.

Edit: There are several people mentioning cutting the cable or taking it from the department once it was found bad. In hindsight I could have taken it to biomed for them and let him know the situation, but he makes rounds through the hospital and is easy for the department to get ahold of so I didn't think to do that at the time. My department does replace other common cables/peripherals (ethernet, USB, mice, keyboards, etc) that we find to be broken or causing issues so that we do not get repeat tickets for it. Serial cables are one of the few things that we do not carry since the only thing they are used for in our environment is biomed equipment, so my go-to was to let biomed handle it since they declined letting me order a new one for them.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_da0aev,"So close, yet so far","A user called in stating that ""email was totally gone"", so I connected in to see that the Office upgrade we're pushing just went sideways on their machine.  I pull up Software Center and see it sitting in the Installation Status queue as failed, so I pull it up and retry it.  The usual progress wrapper we put on these kinda things pops up and I see it start churning, so now it's time to sit and wait.

After a few minutes of silence between us on the phone where I get some much needed sips of coffee in, I decide I want to get back to listening to music.

&gt;**me:** Hey, so this is probably going to take a little while, so I'll leave my remote window up and keep an eye on it in case it tanks again.  The first bit takes some time while it runs some cleanup bits to make sure all the old stuff is gone, but once that finishes up the rest is usually pretty quick.

&gt;**her:** Oh okay, sounds good.  Do you know how long it'll take?

&gt;**me:** Eh, usually about 30 or 40 minutes.  You can still work on stuff while this runs in the background, just not any Office stuff.  But yeah, I'll keep an eye on it and if I see it fail again we can just install it manually.

&gt;**her:** Sounds good!

So we hang up, I punch up my ticket, and I go back to doing whatever I was doing.  I look over and see there's an error message up on her main screen regarding Excel not starting properly.  Weird.  I hit Okay on it and wait for a few seconds.  I watch her mouse over to a different Excel document and try to open up that one.  Lo and behold, another application failed to start error comes up.  Okay, that's on me.  I didn't specify that Excel and Word are part of the Office suite.  Fair enough, so I open up my preferred method of remote, non-verbal communication in times like this, Notepad.

&gt;**me:** Hey, sorry, Excel and Word are both going to be broken until the installer finishes up.

&gt;**her:** is it okay if i go on the internet?

&gt;**me:** Yeah, that's fine.  Just keep in mind you'll have to restart at some point in the near future.

&gt;**me:** ok thanks!

I watch her pull up our homepage, navigate over to OneDrive, and get in to her files.  She digs through her stuff for a bit and then eventually finds the same sheet she was going to open previously.  I watch her click on it, mouse over to the Open button, and then immediately shatter my hope by clicking Open with Excel rather than Open with Excel Online.  She gets the same application failure she was getting previously and her mouse settles and doesn't move throughout the rest of the the install.

t3_d9savy,Headphones don't work when you don't wear them,"Small backstory. My team at work provides telephony services to customers. This particular customer has multiple departments.

I get a ticket at the start of the week. User from Department1 is having issues with reaching Department2. Every time they call, their calls go 'straight to voicemail'. I check the logs and the routing, and find that calls are actually targetting a user in Department2 and ringing for 15 seconds before diverting to voicemail as they are going unanswered. I recheck this with User1 and they confirm that there is ringing when they call, but User2 says they get no ringing on their own end.

I follow up with User2 and gather the logs from their own phone. Sure enough, there's the call attempts coming. Based on the logs, the calls come in, trigger a pop up on the user's screen, and ring for 15 seconds before diverting to voicemail. The following conversation happens:

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hey User2, we are still looking into this issue with calls not ringing on your end

User2: Hey Me, yes I don't get any ringing at all.

Me: Well, one thing I want to check. Your phone logs say you have a headset, do you?

User2: Yes I do.

Me: OK, does the sound for your phone normally go through that?

User2: Yes it does. When I am on calls, I use the headset.

Me: And you don't hear the ringing coming through the headset?

User2: Well I do sometimes. I sometimes have the headset on and a call comes in, and I can hear the ringing in them.

Me \*sometimes have the headset on, so you don't hear anything through the headset when you don't have them on?\* : Just to clarify User2, you don't wear your headset all the time?

User2: Well no, I usually have them on the charger stand behind my monitor.

Me: OK User2, it looks like all the sound for your phone comes through your headset. You can't hear the ringing, because you don't have your headphones on.

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently looking into the desktop settings and application settings (there's a PC app that controls the phone) to see if the ringing can be separated from the rest of the audio and played through the computer speakers, or the phone itself. 

TLDR: Turns out that you can't hear sound through your headphones when you aren't wearing them.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d9nxnk,$300 well spent,"I work as a tech in ""higher"" education.  Dealing with Faculty on the regular can be somewhat frustrating at times, but this one was a real head-scratcher.

Last summer, we moved the Humanities department from one building to another due to a renovation.  After the reno was finished, and we moved these instructors back to their new offices.  One of them threw a ticket in claiming we ""Switched her new Compaq computer with an old Dell computer"" and provided pictures to ""prove"" it.

First of all, we stopped deploying Compaqs/HPs in 2010, when we made the jump to Windows 7 coupled with an OEM switch.  Secondly, the asset tags in both of her before and after photos matched.  

She also refuses us entry into her office if she's not there, but refuses to come in before 7:00 PM, when IT goes home at 6. We tried to point out that the computer was not swapped, pointed to the mass move spreadsheet her Dean put together for the renovation with the Asset # on it, that matched her photos.  The ONLY difference was that because her new desk was smaller, we had to lay the computer horizontally with the monitor sitting on top, rather than standing vertically next to the monitor.  She also claimed we swapped out her monitor, keyboard, and external speakers with ""old, antiquated models from the 1990's"".  Even though you can clearly see that they all matched in her B/A photos.  She ignored our email for two weeks, and we close the ticket due to no response.  This resulted in a SCATHING email asking us why we refuse to bring back her old computer, and how can we justify taking taxpayer money for our salaries.

So I get permission to work an hour OT to meet this woman and figure out WTF she's on about.  Before I left, I printed out the signout sheet she signed when we gave her the computer in 2015, with the Make/Model and Serial of the computer she had signed out.  

I get to her office, and show her that EVERYTHING MATCHES.  The asset tags in the photos, the serial numbers match with her entry in our inventory, as well as the computer sign-out sheet THAT SHE SIGNED when the computer was originally deployed to her office.  I ask her if she's missing files, or if her desktop doesn't look right when she logs in. 

NOPE. 

Apparently when we were moving 20+ faculty after-hours in one night, we also had time to export and import her profile and all her files onto this ""old"" computer.

I said ""I don't know what else to tell you.  This is the computer you had before the renovation.""   
She tells me to get out of her office and she'll ""Make do with this garbage we gave her"".

I got back to my office, document EVERYTHING. Included a few pictures I took when I was in her office on the ticket for posterity, and closed it.  Gave my boss a heads up (the woman has attempted to grieve IT in the past for self-inflicted wounds), and had a laugh over a beer later.  

A few months later, the computer in her office is due for a life-cycle upgrade. So we created a ticket asking her to start organizing her files so we can transfer them over at the time of the upgrade. We got an angry response from her saying she ""doesn't want anyone from IT near her office as we all conspired to gaslight her back in January, and continued correspondence attempts will be considered criminal harassment"". 

Kicked the ticket up to my manager, who contacted her Dean, along with copies of all her other tickets showing a complete refusal to work with IT whenever she has a problem.  The Dean was sympathetic to our plight, and told us she'd take care of it.  Got a response from the instructor a few days later saying that after speaking her Dean, she'd like to take advantage of the Technology Opt-Out program, in which the college pays her $300, tax-free, to provide and use her own equipment.  This also means she no longer will receive network resource access or printing capabilities, as we don't let non-college owned devices on the network.  **It also means we no longer have to support her.**  Additionally, if she doesn't provide the college with proof that she used that money to purchase a new computer within 3 months of receiving the funds, it's taxed as a bonus.

Everyone in my department agrees that $300 to get her to fuck off is money well spent.",talesfromtechsupport

The company is a marketing company with specific requirements and budget so there was no going away from tower PCs. One day I received a ticket from their department manager asking me to remove the ugly boxes as they don't need them.

I decided to call and explain about the boxes...

Me | DM: Department Manager | DM's Boss

Me (On the Phone): Hello IT Support, Me speaking

DM: O good you're calling to arrange collection, I would like the boxes collected in precisely one hour as we are going to a conference later.

Me: No, I'm not calling to schedule a meeting but to explain that if we remove these boxes you won't be able to use the computers

DM: Do you think I'm Stupid?

Me: No, I'm just explaining that you won't be able to use your computer without the computer being connected to the screen

DM: What are you talking about? I don't look under my table to use the computer. Look you obviously don't know what you're talking about, I want to talk to someone who knows about IT. O I also want your first name and surname so that I can make a complaint!

Me:  My name is Me, I'm not giving you my surname for data protection and I do know what I'm talking about. Trust me, if you remove the actual computer, the box you are referring to you won't be able to use the computer.

DM: Watch the Space! *Slams the phone down!*

*I closed the job documenting everything. A week's gone by and we get an Emergency call-out, stating that none of their computers are working. We arrived to find all the computer towers have been cut free from their cages and removed.*

Me: What happened to all the towers?

DM: I told you to watch the space, I got a professional team to remove the boxes! See it is possible!

Me: No I don't see, now you can't use the computers!

DM: What a lot of nonsense, just get the internet working so that we can use the computers again!

Me: No, what happened to the computers?

DM: Are you stupid or something? They're here! *referring to the monitors*

Me: Ok, ok what happened to the boxes?

DM: They took them to the skip

Me: Right you are telling me that you threw away leased computers which are worth £1300 each? I want to speak to your boss Now!

DM: He's in a meeting

Me: Get him now! This is very serious

DM: Ok

DM's Boss: First you refuse to do your job and now you pull me out of a meeting? Where are all the computers by the way?

Me: DM threw them away and we need to get them back now as they had sensitive data on them.

DM's Boss: Where are the computers?

DM: You mean the boxes?

DM's Boss: YES!!!

DM: they are heading to the skip

We drove to the skip but there was no record of these computers being brought in. Two weeks later the company suffered data breach which along with the damage bill caused the company to go into administration

t3_d9srwq,Let me regale you with a story of a lowly ICT worker desperately trying to just do his god damn job.," TL:DR – ICT worker tries to get work done, gets blamed for other people’s shortcut taking.

I’ve worked in my role for a little over 6 months now, I’ve been in IT for over 10 years. I’m not in a front line role (support) but as I’m the only IT rep at my site I’m often given these sorts of jobs because “it’s easier just to go to you”… I’m sure you can relate. 

It’s been a struggle trying to get my office to understand that ICT process exists for a reason and I’m not saying “no” because I’m a prick, but because it stops things from going wrong and keeps the managers happy. 

I usually fight the good fight when I get a request that doesn’t conform to process. I’ll start with a soft approach and steer them in the right direction, then escalate until process is followed. It can take days to convince them that following process is the right path to take.  

This latest instance however I’m right in the middle of upgrading our Nutanix gear and hosting hypervisor infrastructure so I really don’t have time to spend dealing with a this particularly noisy staff member. She has a temp that’s come in to fill a recently vacated position and I’m assured they will only be in the role for a week max so they want to use the ex-staff member’s account until they get a full time replacement.

“That’s not what should happen but if you can get approval from HR and your boss I guess that’s fine for a week” 

Big mistake. 

3 weeks and 2 temps later finance get wind of what going on and it blows up. 

Turns out the noisy staff member has the Temps doing her team’s expense approvals “because the temp has an accounting background”. This set off alarm bells with the CFO. Expense approvals are noisy staff member’s job and it shouldn’t be delegated without upper-management approval, which didn’t happen. 

So now I’ve got the CFO, the CIO and my manager all trying to pin blame on one another with me just sitting there trying to get my time critical upgrade done. My manager has called me four times to confirm my story (it’s all logged in our ITSM tool) because noisy staff member keeps making up crap to push the blame onto me. 

The moral of the story? Just follow process, even if it doesn’t make sense at the time.",talesfromtechsupport

Me: Me

My mother: Mom

A short while after the PC was set up we got ourselves a nice new DSL hookup with some abysmal speeds, but enough to do the basics.

Anyways, my mom had heard about hotmail's chat rooms and wanted to give them a go.

Now to say she's computer illiterate would be a massive understatement, but she's at least aware of that fact. And wanted to write every aspect of using the computer down in a notepad, so she could use it without having to harass me all the time. (almost unicorn level there)

So I show her hotmail, the main page is the login/create page:

Me: Do you have an account?

Mom: I don't know, do I?

Me: well have you ever used hotmail before? 

Mom: (starts shuffling though her notepad)... No

Me:  ok then, well have to make an account for you. Click create.

But she doesn't click create, she starts writing ""click create"" in her notepad.

Me, chuckling: No, mom, making an account with a page is a one time thing, you will not have to make an account with them again, so writing this down will be useless.

Mom: I just want to be sure that if you're not here that I can use this chatroom!

Me: I'm aware, but if we skip this first step in the notepad, you'll still be able to use the site if I'm not here.

Mom: I'll FEEL better if I do.

Me: fine, I'm just saying you're overcomplica-

Mom: I'm gonna write it down! (proceeds to do so)

At this point I cave, letting her write it down, knowing it's going to confuse her later. We finalize making the account and she gets into a chatroom. She's happy.

I even showed her logging out and back in. 

---

The next day I come home from school to an angry mother.

Mom: your instructions didn't work! I can't use the chatroom!

Me: what? No, we covered everything, even logging in for later.. What's it saying?

Mom: That username is already taken.

Me, laughing: I knew it! Remember that whole ""don't write that down!""? Because you wouldn't need that section again. I bet you're trying to make a duplicate account.

So she shows me exactly what she's doing.

And sure enough, she gets to the main page, clicks ""create account"" and literally fills in the exact same data as the day before, and sure enough, it won't let her make an already existing account.

I sigh. I go back to the main page, click log in, and inform her to put her info in there.

Mom: but the notepad says click create account!

Me: and I told you to not add that to the notepad! Read farther down where I show you how to login to your very real and existing account.

She huffs, logs in, and says in a very disgruntled voice: ""thank you""",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d9mwln,User Breaks Down During Computer Refresh,"This happened a number of years ago, we had a contractor who would order and install (refresh) computers every 4 years for our end users. He shared this story with me before his contract ended. The refresh tech (RT) came in first thing in the morning to begin coping data from the old PC to the new PC for this User (U). He proceeds to disconnect the New PC and takes it to the users desk. He replaces the new PC with the old and has the user sign in.

U: Are you sure this is a new computer? The screen looks exactly the same.

RT: Yes, it is a brand new desktop tower. I moved all of your files over this morning.

U: Yeah, but everything on the screen is the same. It's still blurry and the icons are fuzzy.

RT: Oh, I see what you mean. I am just here to replace your Computer tower, and not the screen. Computer Screens (she had an old CRT at the time) aren't covered under the lease. Just the PC Tower.

U: What do you mean? They told me I was getting a new computer? 

RT: Well, you did get a new computer. It is right here on your desk.

U: No, I thought this was the computer! (She points to the old clunky CRT)

RT: Like I said, that is just the Monitor screen, and those are purchased outright. If you want a new one your manager will need to submit an order for one, and your local tech will install it. 

U: I...I...just can't. This is outrageous! They are just trying to kick me out of this place! (At this point she is full sniffle, starting to cry). They just want me to retire and don't give me anything new! I just cant stay here right now! (She begins to gather her things as if she were going home)

RT: (In shock that User is in full cry mode) Well, if you want I can ask your manager or see if your tech has any extra new screens laying around?

U: No, no...I just cant...this place is to much for me...I am leaving! (She proceeds to leave for the day).

Refresh tech comes back to me in shock and tells me everything, asking if he did something wrong, etc etc. I told him that group in particular is very cheap with their budget and I could give him an older flat panel screen to giver her, which he does while she isn't there, thinking this would make her happy. Well apparently not. She comes back 2 days later and finds the new screen, and is complaining that ""everything is too big"" and it is ""too bright"" I go down and turn the brightness lower and proceed to change the screen res and icon size, but she keeps just telling me that it is too big. I was thiking that the 17 inch screen was too big, but she wasn't able to explain ""what was too big"", so I eventually put a newer-older CRT screen back in and she finally seemed happy--until a month later when she decided to retire after 36 years.

t3_d9lut9,It's always IT's fault!,"A few years ago my help desk was supporting a big client that had a dated and badly conceived IT infrastructure. I can see how y'all are surprised! /s

Big Client had recently introduced a new software to replace an older one, and a few days after the software had been rolled out we get a frantic call from the head of the department that used that software, screaming that it isn't working and to fix everything asap. After some tinkering around we realized that the server hosting the new software was offline. Mind you, we were not involved in the roll out of said software, we just knew the server's IP address and general location and the contact for that sofware's own technical support. And only because I pestered the client. But I'm digressing... let's just say that the client wasn't in a hurry to get us up to speed, as they were very disorganized.

At this point I called one of the on site techs, and after a frustrating search, he was able to locate the room the server was in and someone who could open the door to let him inside. It turned out this server was not in a proper server room, but in a regular room filled with distribution boards, network switches and other (unknown to us) servers. My coworker was eventually able to locate the server and he noticed that it was on, but there was an on screen message asking why the server had been improperly shut down. We assumed there was a blackout, fixed the problem, labeled the server with a sticker, and we went on with our day.

Except the same thing happened a week later. And the week after. At this point we suspected there was something going on that we didn't know about, like an electrical problem or something like that, so we decided to talk with the department responsible for the electricity, cables, phone network, emergency power system, etc. They swore there was nothing wrong on their side and blamed us for the server rebooting on its own. They also prevent us from checking on the server by ourselves (my on site team wanted to check the cables, test the UPS, etc). 

This went on for MONTHS and of course the department head was getting angrier by the day, as he couldn't use the software at least once a week until we physically sent a tech to reboot the server. Obviously, we IT folks were being blamed for this by everyone, from the higher ups to the department staff, everyone was going ballistic and wanted our heads on a pike. Meanwhile the Maintenance Guys were going on with their version of the events that nothing was wrong and everything worked! There were no blackouts! At a certain point, we stopped answering all the email that we were getting about this problem, as they were getting downright abusive, and we had done everything we could to troubleshoot the problem. We'd just fix the server once a week and that was it.

One day one of my techs ran into the former boss of the Maintenance department in a local café, this guy had retired a few months ago at that point. My tech mentioned the problem we were having and Former Boss went into Surprised Pikachu Face mode, explaining that they usually had a weekly test to make sure the Emergency Power System in the building was working properly. They did this early in the morning before the staff arrived to minimize disruption. Sure enough, the day after this lucky meeting, the server went down, but this time my tech had gotten on site before his usual start time and stalked the maintenance crew until they started to test the system. At that point he stepped in and demanded an explanation. The guys got very agitated and sent him away, but not before he could verify that the server was not connected to the UPS (""We did it! One of you must have disconnected it!"") and it shut down suddenly every time they tested the EPS. He was smart enough to take pictures as well!

We documented everything, compiled a huge ass email with screenshots, pictures and past emails and we sent it to all the parties involved. I'd love to end this story by saying that everyone apologized to us, but what happened instead was that maintenance quietly fixed the problem and we never heard a single word about it ever since. We were lucky enough that the server itself hadn't gotten damaged by all the sudden blackouts!

It's always the IT folks's fault, isn't it?

PS I didn't go into much detail, but the server hadn't even been tested before being installed, it turned out it was under capacity and soon we started to get phone calls because the software was too slow. It all ended a few years later when the client finally invested some money into moving their servers in a managed data center (too expensive!1!!1).",talesfromtechsupport

t3_d9joex,5 calls about the same PIN pad,"So I posted here only a few days ago after not hearing from this user for about a month, but wouldn't you know it, she called again. About the same PIN pad. 

Check out my previous post for the context up to this point:

$Me: Helpdesk this is $Me

$User: Okay so the PIN pad isn't working

$Me: (Oh God not this again)

$User: It just says device not found.

$User: Yes!

$Me: (Wow this sounds like a real problem) Okay I'll restart the service.

t3_d9idlt,We will contact your shortly : a game of Clue,"LTLFTP, on sick leave so let's try my own tale writing (english not my mothertongue).

When I was still green, I was assigned my very first website to do on my own, the first ""for a real client with a real business"" responsibility after months of just helping my *$senpai*. The client was a single dude providing remote tech support to residential customers, basically installing Team Viewer on first visit, but the design my $boss made was cute and we have a fair share of ""old people not good with computers"" around so not a bad idea.

With my trusty _$phpCms_ and frontend skills I spend a few days on all the help pages, price &amp; services display, utmost-necessity-homepage-carousel and finally the forms. Along with your standard contact form, we had a more focused support form asking many questions about your machine and setup.

Since I was alone on this, I wasn't kept in the loop much by my project manager $pm on the deadline but I already knew not to ask questions I didn't want the answer. And I had an ace in my sleeve : _[I know jQuery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vMO3XmNXe4)_.

jQuery 1.3 was in beta and forms didn't have built-in validations, nor there was much validation and field-dependencies libraries yet, nor modules for _$phpCms_. So of course I rolled my own, we can't trust the user to know how to fill fields ?

I even started to add Ajax to my forms and quickly realized that event binding was a bit of a pain in the b*tt when your replace your entire form via your custom AJAX endpoint. Classic ""works the first time you click"" which burned the days I thought I still had before release.

Then murphy's law popped up to say Hi and I was told :

- That the homepage block redirecting to the support form should be a quick contact form only asking for name &amp; phone number to drive conversion
- That the website should be live by the end of the week. Meaning this friday.

Inserting the form as a block was non-trivial, and broke my custom AJAX, and I gave up on the idea of validating the phone number. I wasn't much of an ops guy so it was my first deployment on said friday, so I had a bit of trouble but it was live before the end of the afternoon.

I asked for validation and manual testing by $boss and $pm and we filled all forms and I checked that emails were received on our side, customer and admin notifications. We get a call from $client and I'm handed the phone :

&gt; _$client_ : Thanks for the release and hard work, $pm said he wasn't sure you could make it so I appreciate the effort.  
&gt; _$beamingPrideMe_ : thanks and no worries, you should have more and more calls when the SEO work kicks in.  
&gt; _$client_ : yeah that's why I've printed a few thousand leaflets with the website URL on it, that me and my friends &amp; family will distribute around town starting tomorrow.  

No pressure.  

It's important to note that the customer didn't want his own phone number to be advertised, since he didn't have a dedicated line for its business, this is why the quick contact form was a priority. This contact form displayed a success message that still haunts me to this day : ""__We will contact you shortly (~20min)__""

On monday I checked our email inbox set as the admin notification copy, and sure enough there was a few emails on support/contact forms so business was rolling. Since the inbox was shared for multiple site, I didn't want it to be spammed by quick contact notification so I didn't set a copy for this form.

After a few weeks $pm told me that $client was not as quick in paying as he was as requesting features before, so support request should go through him before I do anything. Funnily enough, these requests started appearing to tell us to fix a lot of things since the website didn't perform as much as expected, and since content is king and SEO what pays on the long run, we agreed on a quick few changes.

But nothing changed, maybe it was the toilet paper quality leaflets, or the design, or... and since the client was himself a techie and had a bit of free time, he started nitpicking on a few things.

If this story is a bit long and rambly, it was designed as such to give you time to to think about what could be the cause of the unexpected poor performance of the website and an insight on how things worked between the different Clue protagonists of the story. And to ask if my english is good enough for future tales.

When I was finally asked to see if there was a technical issue, I quickly realized that the quick contact submission were nowhere to be found in the backend. Other forms were fine, but this one was empty, maybe the client deleted them after use to know who he had already contacted ? While I was emitting this suggestion to $pm, his face went white :

&gt; _$pm_ : What if the form doesn't work ?

Now if you have used jQuery and the $.ajax method, you know that you can setup some callbacks to handle what happens on form submit. Namely `success` and `error` but also `complete` which triggers in every case.  
Can you guess which one I used ?  
And which URL had to be hardcoded since the form was not the current page displayed ?  
Can you guess what happened to this URL during deployment on a different subdomain ?  

Sure enough, the browser console displayed a clean 404 error on the form action. In a cold sweat I opened my JS file and checked the `complete` callback I used and the _$phpCms_ code I did. Turns out my custom check was far from enough and only `success` and `error` callbacks automatically checks for 200 vs 3XX/4XX/5XX error before executing your own code. 

We were displaying ""__We will contact you shortly__"" while never sending your phone number to anybody, for weeks now. Like any catastrophe, it was a pile of mistake on everyone parts on top of my technical mishap : both us and the customer could have checked the form submission on the backend, both us and our prone-to-criticize-our-choice-of-HTML-tags-client could have opened the console or the source code to see the incorrect URL on the homepage, the $pm/client/dev process, absence of _$senpai_ oversight... but that was a long time ago so the post mortem is no longer necessary.

What was necessary at the time was deciding on the fix and what to tell the client. I felt my own employment was in the balance too, so I was less picky on bullshitting our way out. In the end we told the client we found the issue and what it was, and didn't charge for all the subsequent support request. But it wasn't long before he took everything in his own hands since he oddly still had free time, and the website is still live to this day but with a phone number to call and without any forms.

Tl;Dr : quick contact form aka main conversion endpoint was sending clients to the shadow realm

t3_d93055,Let me un-fix that for you,"Dave and I worked at a Helpdesk in the 90's. For reasons lost to time, I found myself in the car with him at the end of the day going home.

Dave was dropping by a client on the way to fix something that was broken. Not sure what the circumstances were exactly, but I stayed in the car and he went in to see what was up.

Comes back a couple of minutes later with a big grin on his face and tells me what happened.

Dave explains to the client that there is a minimum call-out fee of $100. Client agrees.

The client needs to have some setting fixed, something about a printer if memory serves me, so Dave opens up the Windows Control Panel, dives in 17 clicks later, problem fixed.

Dave says: ""All done, that will be $100 please.""

Client is unhappy that this little clicking exercise would cost $100 and says: ""I'm not paying for that.""

Dave says: ""No problem"", reopens the Windows Control Panel, 17 more clicks, problem un-fixed.

Client emulates fish gasping for air.

Dave says: ""Have a nice evening. Bye."" and walks out.

t3_d9967o,Look! Up on Production! It's a bug! It's a feature! It's...,"...poorly thought-out requirements.

I'm a developer for a small digital agency. Too small to have separate teams for development and front-line support.

I'm working, at the moment, on a mixture of support and the latest new feature for the site we've built and maintain for one of our clients. It's a rather specialised eCommerce site. A while ago we built a click and collect feature into the site to integrate with the client's network of physical stores - before that all online orders had been delivered to the customer.

Our original client contact, whose name is not Tom, left the company shortly after we did the development for that feature. He was great. He wasn't very technical, but he was computer-literate enough to use the system we built, he knew the business domain thoroughly, and he *knew* that he wasn't very technical and he *trusted* us. He also knew how to submit a decent bug report.

We miss !Tom, although his replacement, who is not called Sam, is not bad.

So today !Sam submitted an urgent bug report. A customer had requested, and the request was to be granted. It was a click and collect order, which had been sent out to the store for collection, and I don't know why they were getting a refund, but, !Sam said, it wasn't possible to refund the order.

My project manager assigned me the ticket, I jumped on the test environment, and had absolutely no difficulty in replicating the issue. The button to refund simply wasn't there for click and collect orders.

So, I went into the code. It was just as easy to see why the button was missing: `if !clickAndCollect`. Intentional beyond reasonable doubt. There was a ""cancel"" button instead, specific to click and collect, which would only update the order's status and not touch the card transaction. (For a bonus, this button is in two places, and only one of them was actually hooked up to the server-side function.) But what to say to !Sam?

I dug out the old spec for the click and collect feature and trawled through it. I'd not had any part in the building of this feature: it was mainly done by a dev who's name is not Ken, and I'd not really had occasion to look into how it worked until now.

Jackpot! There was a note in the spec, to the effect that a specific requirement had come direct from !Tom that click and collect orders should not be able to be refunded through the site's back end. They would be returned to the head office if the customer didn't show up to collect them within a stated time-frame, and if that was the case they needed to be cancelled *without* automatically refunding the customer the money, so that the client could get in touch with the customer and find out whether they still wanted it, without having to take payment again if they did.

So the urgent bug is not a bug, it's a feature, except it is a bug because *that's silly*. Of course there's going to be reasons why click and collect customers can ask for and receive refunds. What we need is a cancel button *as well as* a refund button.

My project manager signed off on my proposal with ""Oh yeah, I forgot that was intentional.""

I had the fix checked in (*and* fixed the broken button without the client even noticing it) within three hours of the bug being reported, and an hour and a half of that was a meeting and my lunch break. It's on the test environment and will be released tomorrow if only we can induce !Sam to test and approve it by lunchtime, which I reckon is pretty prompt service. But if I'd been dev on that feature, I'm pretty sure I'd have suggested it at the time. (And not forgotten to make that button actually do something. Project manager: ""I'm happy for you not to mention it to !Sam but you can shout at !Ken about it if you want."" I didn't.)",talesfromtechsupport

t3_d91aa6,Words have no meaning,"This just happened and I just need to vent so sorry not sorry you're my victims.

A user calls in, saying that they have a package that their system is asking them to send to another site. That other site can't handle that type of parcel according to them, so something is wrong in the system.

Naturally, I check my system, and it says this other site does handle this type of package. Naturally, the user says no sites of that type handles that type of package.

The conversation gets more and more heated as the user gets pissed off and I try to deescalate, offering up a whole host of people that can help them with how the process works. After all, if the system says that site handles that type of package, it does, right?

I end up ending the call after getting their contact information because they're adamant that they're right and I'm wrong. I call around, talk to various people, who all agree with me that that site definitely handles that type of parcel. Finally, I get to the big boss of that entire flow, and ask her. She says that no sites of that type handle that parcel. I ask why the system says they do, which she finds weird and starts investigating. Then I get this gem.

t3_d97bgw,How did that file get to the other server?,"This happened back in the late 90's I was hired to work as a programmer for a fairly small company. Since they were so small my 'office' was a corner of the network center. we had 4 or 5 PCs all networked to handle the basic server needs. 

After I had been there a few months, they hired a new network admin to assist the network manager. Since my 'office' was in that room I got to witness her doing MANY things that made no sense if she actually knew anything about networks. 

The first thing I saw her do that let me know she didn't know much about networks was whenever she had to move a file from one server to another she used Sneaker net. (That was the process of putting a file on one or more floppies and walking to the other machine and copying it.)

I tried to tell her that she could just map the server as an additional drive, but she told me I was just a programmer and didn't understand the complexities of networking. (I had triple majored in CIS at college, CIS Programming, CIS system Analysis, and CIS Networking. So I actually did know a bit about Networking.)

One day on my machine, I mapped the drives to all the servers as drives. The next time she started copying files to a floppy I casually struck up a conversation and found out what files she was moving to another server. I quickly opened my mapped drives and copied before she was half way across the room. 

When she tried to copy the file from the floppy, it asked if she wanted to replace the one that was already there. She asked herself aloud how that file got there and went back to her desk and went back to work. 

I just shook my head and let her keep using sneaker net if that is what she preferred.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d96c98,Quarterly Password Changes,"Earlier this year we enacted some new security policies on a client that was seriously out of date. They had a breach, we cleaned up, and moved forward. 

We are now at the first password expiration date and my life is falling apart. I warned them mid-month this was happening, and explained the process for logging in to change a password on Windows. I was immediately met with backlash about how this was a waste of time for their employees, they couldn't possibly adjust the daily schedule for this, etc etc. 

I tried politely to explain, and I was met with them asking me to manually change the passwords for the entire company through AD, as well as changing the passwords for their internal billing and records systems. The precedent was that I did it during the infection (something I considered needed at the time, and a one-off ticket due to the breach) so I must be able to do it now. 

I took it to my superiors internally at our MSP, who then had a phone interaction with the client, and came back telling me that we would be doing the password resets manually four times per year this way, going forward.

The reset date is October 1st, they all waited till today to get back to me with their ""decision"", it is expected to be done within a window of ONLY SUNDAY because this client can't possibly make a concession in ANY WAY to assist with this.

Today $user makes a ticket that she gets randomly disconnected from the web app and I claim the ticket.

I start with normal debugging, starting with checking if it's a network problem. Her computer is fine, no dropped packets, other websites are fine.

I instruct her to use for a few hours the app in another browser. Same issue.

$user gets back to me that the issue persists. Randomly disconnect from web app and presented with login screen.

I have tested her account thoroughly and nothing stands out whatsoever.

Next step I decide to make her another account and transfer her data over.

I give her the new password and after 1h I get a ticket reply:

$user: Problem still here.

I must gather my thoughts for a few seconds that seem like an eternity because what I could not believe what I saw.

The mistery why she was getting disconnected:

Whenever she opened an email that she had to read in detail, she would maximize the email window. After she was done with the email, she pressed the ""X"" in the top right corner. Nothing wrong here. Only she wasn't pressing it normally, she would double click the bloody button.

The logout button in our app is in the top right corner, right under the close button from the maximized email window. Whenever she was closing a maximized email window she would double click and the 2nd click was logging her out.

He: ""Listen, we used to have a server, but we don't have it anymore. ""

Me: ""You used to have a server until *yesterday*, or what do you mean?""

He: ""No, no, my company used to be bigger. I had five employees in this offices. But we had to resize. The last employee left six years ago. At this time the whole complicated IT stuff was thrown out. Now it's just my computer. Nothing else.""

Me: ""Can we take a look around then? There *must* be something! Probably some small NAS in a cabinet or something""

&amp;#x200B;

After this discussion he showed me the whole floor... obviously he still rented six rooms even if he was the only one left working there. So most of the floor seemed deserted.

As you can imagine we ended up finding his server. It was actually quite big and silently stood in the corner of one of the rooms. Behind the door, so that you actually couldn't see it when you entered and left the door open.

It turned out that the plugbar the server was connected to died (yes... really). When I plugged it into another outlet it booted and a few minutes later the network share was accessible again.

It was a Windows Server 2003 that obviously continued to work reliably for at least six years *after* the last person who knew that it existed left the company... 

The guy was very surprised and told me that he had never seen this server before and that he can't comprehend how this thing could have sat there for so many years without him ever noticing it. (I was wondering too because the thing made some noticeable fan noise...)

Since the server was doing nothing else than provide the guy with a few hundred megabytes of files we shut it down after we copied the files to his local harddrive (and setting up a backup there).

The customer then hired us to look through his regular IT expenses in case there is something else he doesn't know about.

Well... there was... it turned out that he paid about 150$ per month for hosted exchange mailboxes that nobody had been using for years (plus a ton of other hosting stuff that he didn't need) . He also still had a PBX and paid about five phone lines etc. I think we saved him several thousand bucks a year just by cancelling useless subscriptions that he kept paying and paying. This was about two or three years ago. In the meantine he acquired a taste for saving money and actually moved into his office floor. The deserted room where we had ""found"" the server is now his bedroom.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d8kss9,Do you have any idea what that printer cost you?,"So I finally have a story that isn't too depressing to put on here. First a little background, I am field tech for a little Mom and Pop operation. I take care of everything from networking, to computer hardware. We mostly deal with small businesses, but occasionally I get stuck with a residential.

So it was like any other Wednesday morning, I woke up and checked my tickets. Saw that a residential had been assigned to my schedule, and looked at the notes. Saw that the customer was providing the parts, she just needed us to set it up for her. I sighed and bitched to myself before heading onsite.

Wednesday day morning I show up about a half hour early, I ring the customers doorbell... no answer. So I go and sit in the car, thinking maybe the customer wasnt home yet. When it was time for the schedule appointment I went and rang the door bell again. I got no response, so I decided to call the number on the ticket.

Divinechaos91: Hi, this is Divinechaos91with Mom and Pop Tech. I have you on schedule, and I was just seeing if you were available.

Customer: *angrly* I've been waiting for you! I'll come to the door to let you in.

I hang up the phone with her, and before she can come to the door, I get a call from the office. Apparently the customer, had called and complained that I was not there on time. Even though I had been waiting for her in my car to let me in. I explain what happened to the office, shrug it off before the customer comes to the door.

The customer brings me up to her daughters room, and tells me she needs this printer setup, that was brand new in the box.

Customer: So I want this setup to the wifi so everyone can print off of.

Divinechaos91: As long as the printer has the capability it shouldn't be a problem. Should only take me a little bit.

I start opening the box and the printer and find that its USB only. I apologize to the customer, and explain that it wouldn't be possible and it would have to print only from her daughters laptop when it was plugged in. She sighs, and tells me fine. It was about this time I started to realize this was a cheaper printer. I set everything up and find the printer didn't come with a USB cable.

Divinechaos91: Sorry, Customer it didnt come with a cable. Do you happen to have one?

Customer: *visibly upset* Well dont you have a USB cable for it?!?!?! You're suppose to be the tech.

I apologized, explained that my notes said she had told the office that she would provide the parts. She got upset and criticized me for not being prepared. I apologized again, I told her that our office was about 10 mins down the road, and I'd be right back. So after driving back to the office to get the USB cable, I went back and tested her printer... 

This where things start to get worse, and realize that the customer doesnt have a basic understanding of how any of this works. I setup the printer on her daughters laptop, I go to print out a test page and ask for some paper. She hands me an already used paper. That had appeared to come from her daughters school, already printed on one side. I shrugged and said it should be fine for a quick test print. I run the test page, and find the ink to be extremely faded. I ask her for another page, and run it again. I do this a few more times.

Divinechaos91: So it looks like the ink cartridges have dried up. How long have you had the printer?

Customer: 3 years

Divinechaos91 *shocked pichaku face* ( I cant for the life of me figure out why anyone be paying this kind of money for an old printer.)

Customer: why is that a problem?

I show her the test pages, and explain what is happening. I tell her I believe that her ink cartridges have dried up. Shes takes a shot at me asking if I was guessing or if I knew what I was talking about. I ignore her and check the price of ink cartridges. Shocker its ridiculous amount of money. I explain she would be better off buying a new printer with the features she wanted. That it would be cheaper than  replacing the ink cartridges. I help her pick out a 50 dollar hp all in one printer. 

Customer: Can your company order it for me, and can you come back out onsite to set it up?

Divinechaos91: *internally* ohhhh god why? ""Yes of course let me go ahead and get that ordered for you.

Customer: okay I'll make sure I get some printer paper before you come back.

Friday comes the customer is back on my schedule, the printer had come in everything seemed fine. I headed back onsite and this time just called her immediately instead of ringing her doorbell. She comes to the door.

Customer: ohhh I forgot to get printer paper, we can use some of the old paper to test it, after you set it up?

Divinechaos91: *internally* Why do I even try? "" Yes M'am that should be fine, just get some new paper as soon as you can.

So we do the same thing again, but this time it seems go a little smoother because it's the right kind of printer. I get it setup on the wifi, and setup AirPrint. We test again with her old used paper, it's looking a little wrinkly, but does okay. I explain to her that because we are only using one page, the printer is throwing a fit. So you have to hit the print button on the printer to get it to resume, but it should be fine after you put more than one page in it. We test all her apple devices, and laptop. She thanks me and I'm on my way.

This should be where this damn story ends. But fast forward to Monday, and I see her name pop back up on my schedule. I head back to her place, and shes all pissed off saying I sold her a lemon and going on and on. I apologize for the inconvenience and ask to look at it. 

She brings me back to the printer, and I see that it is asking for more paper...

Divinechaos91: hey do you happen to have anymore paper?

Customer: proceeds to hand me more of her daughters wrinkled worksheets.

The new printer has had enough of this shit,( and really so have I). And starts jamming and ripping the paper. I explain to the customer what's going on and she gets made that I sold her a cheap jamming printer... I smile and go I believe it's the paper. She continues to complain saying I'm a con man and I dont know what im doing. I smile and tell her I'll be right back. I am going to the office to grab a package of paper. 


I get back to the office and rant about residential customers, and head back to the customers with a full stack of paper. I clear the print jobs, fill the printer. I test print, and have the customer test. She appears to be happy with the product, I end up selling her the package of paper so she doesnt have to go to the store. I smile and shake her hand and head off to my next appointment.

So this my tale of the over $500 cheap printer install, sorry it was so long but I needed to rant on this one.

TLDR
Customer puts bad gas in their car and gets made that it keeps stalling.

Update: Most of you guys called it. Shes back on my schedule today, because its saying she is low on ink now... just kill me now please.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d8tb9d,"She bought it in because it was not working, now it not working is my fault.","First post here, so yeah . . .

I work at a computer repair counter at a retailer. This girl comes up with a large semi- custom tower. She tells me that it was working, then she went away for several weeks, and when she came back, the fans would spin, but it wouldn't Display. Alright.

So we test it with her, and it does exactly like she said. I ask her if I can take in the back for some quick trouble shooting and she agrees. (Didn't want to open the case in front of the customer)

Open it up planning to reseat the GPU and RAM. Then I notice the ram is not actually in all the way, so I go to pull it out, only to realize THE DAMN RAM WAS BACKWARDS. So obviously someone had already taken the RAM out once since the last time it was working.

Reseat the RAM nothing. Swap with known good RAM, nothing. Even swap with a test GPU just in case, but nothing seams to fix it. (Old AM3+ motherboard so we didn't have parts to see if it was just the mobo, or mobo and  CPU)

So I bring it out to the client and explain the situation, the conversation went something like:

Me: So, it looks like the RAM was not seated correctly when it was brought in, and because of that, both the RAM and motherboard have failed.

Client: alright, what can we do to fix it?

Me: well unfortunately, we don't sell the kind of motherboard you need, due to the fact that they stoped producing those a few years ago. 

Client: well, what are you gonna do to fix this?

Me: there's not a whole lot we can do, but if you contact the manufacturer . . .

Client: No this worked before. And now that I brought it in, your telling me its broken, so obviously something happened. What are you going to do to make this right?

Me: (baffled) But . . . You brought this in to is because there was an issue, right?

Delusional Client: Yeah, but now your telling me it's broken, and It worked before. So what are you going to do?

She swore up and down that there was  no one who could have opened it up, and flipped the RAM.

I ended up giving her to my manager who I think ultimately ended up exchanging her PC.

TL;DR: Customer brought a computer in with the RAM Magically flipped itself backwards, and then blamed us when we couldn't fix her stupidity.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d8sh46,"No, Rebooting didn't help!","I just got off the phone with a user.  She's a sweet lady and one of those people who you like, but you don't like their tickets.

She was complaining her scan jobs weren't showing up.  The printer scans to a network share so I took a look and the jobs weren't there.   I told her to reboot her scanner and try again and just as I hung up the PDFs showed up on the network share. (There's no way she ran across to the other side of the floor and rebooted the scanner BTW).

I called her to let her know and she told me she was rebooting her PC and that's what fixed it. I tried to explain that her computer isn't involved in this in any way but she didn't want to believe me.  I told her that all rebooting her laptop does is buy time while the scanner is OCRing the job etc.

I got off the phone with her but I still don' think she believes me!

EDIT:  She asked why they are like this and I tried to explain but gave up and just said, literally, ""It's cuz they are shit printers! That's why we are replacing everything in the next few weeks"".",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d8o0r8,I forgot the simple things,"I work at the help desk for a rather large hospital in my area. We get a lot of the normal help desk calls, ""my mailbox is full what do I do?"", ""how do I add a printer?"", ""there is a big crack in my screen how can I fix it?"", etc. We also get a lot of strange requests which you all know are the fun ones, but this story isn't about any of that. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago I updated my work laptop to Windows 10 version 1903, to start testing it and its relevant updates before we go hospital wide with it. Since then I have gotten an error every morning when i start my computer ""A Conexant audio device could not be found"". I never thought anything of it since my headset still worked and I had never had an issue with sound. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well this morning I tried to play a voicemail (for comical reasons) for my Boss to listen to and when I unplugged my headset I had no audio. I started with the standard stuff, making sure nothing was disabled in the device manager, driver updates, bios updates, Google searching laptop make and model for potential known issues, I had no luck with anything. Since the HP driver took so long to download it was the last thing I tried and it finally gave me a clue as to what was wrong. the driver failed and said it couldn't find a device to match the driver. at this point i go back to the device manager and realize that I don't have any sound or audio devices listed, at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where my brain actually started working. I plug in my headset and immediately I have audio devices in the device manager again. some of you may know what happens next, but i felt like such a ""USER"" it took me over an hour to find it. 

So I restart the laptop and go into the bios, I navigate to the built in devices page, and find to my utter amazement that my on board audio had somehow been disabled. I don't know if it was a side effect of the Windows 10 upgrade, one of my many bios updates, or just me not paying attention while making personal preference changes (i hate having fast boot enabled).

t3_d8bqov,Computers can get Jealous,"So, I stopped by this place to replace a windows7 PC with a fresh win10 one. They hadn't done a backup of the machine but it was running fine, so I went ahead and backed up his profile to an external drive, powered down and put it to the side.

I got a call that he was missing his ""labelmaker templates"" so I was like, hmm okay just plug the old machine into a network cable and I'll remote in and take care of it. That old machine never came back up, getting the ""hard drive failure imminent press f1 to continue"" at bios. GREAT! So it never boots up.

t3_d8e7sv,"""But it's not like everyone elses!""","So this happened about a month ago, and was ongoing for several weeks. I was telling my GF this story and she told me I should post it here.

Obligatory context: I work helpdesk at a medium sized bank with several locations, with a total of about 200 employees, so we get a ton of calls/order requests. We've practically stopped asking supervisors for approval with order requests, just because they always, ALWAYS say, ""get them whatever they need for them to work."" So we just do it now. So, a User, we'll call $User, recently received a promotion at one of our offices, congrats to her, and in her new fancy office she got all setup, she requests a new PIN Pad. Now, without going too much into her job description, she really doesn't need one. We all know that. But I package up a brand new, not even out of the box it came in, PIN pad and send it off. So, this story really takes place over 4 conversations with $User. 2 days after I ship it, I get the first call.

$User: So I got the PIN Pad, how do I set it up?

$Me: What do you mean? It's plug-n-play, all you have to do is plug it in and it'll install the drivers.

$User: Well can you help with it?

$Me: ...Have you not tried plugging it in before you called?

$User: No I wanted to call you to make sure I did it right.    (Fair enough, can't entirely blame her there)

$Me: Okay, well just plug it in and it should install everything you need automatically, it's plug-n-play.

$User: Can you talk me through it?

$Me: (Silence as I try to think of the best way to explain how to plug 2 cords that came with it, into the machine)...plug them in?

$User: I'll just get someone here to show me. I'll call you back.

$Me: Okay? There's not really- \*click\*

So I'm sitting there like, A) She really just hung up on me. B) There's NO reason to call us back unless it's not working. 5 minutes later, we get the 2nd call:

$Me: Helpdesk this is $Me

$User: Hi so it's plugged in now but there's a ton of words on the screen.

$Me: Okay, so it's probably just syncing to the $Software server. (I had already enabled her computer for use on the server, all she had to do was plug in the PIN pad and the server would recognize the computer's PIN Pad.)

$User: So how long will that take?

$Me: Tbh it's probably already done

$User: There's still words on the screen

$Me: Have you tried to see if it will work?

$User: No.

$Me: Okay, well give it a try, and if it doesn't work, give us a call back and we'll troubleshoot it.

We don't hear from $User for about 2-3 days, and I think, okay she's figured out how ridiculously easy it is to use these things. Not one, NOT ONE, person in the entire bank, out of all employees, has had problems with their PIN pads. (And if you work helpdesk you know it's rare for a device to just...work). Then we get the 3rd call:

$Me: (Obligatory Greeting)

$User: This PIN pad isn't working right.

$Me: What's wrong with it? Can you describe it?

$User: It's just a blank screen now.

(At this point, all of us in IT look at each other like Jim from the Office) $Me: It's supposed to look like that.

$User: But NO ONE ELSES looks like that.

$Me: Does it work?

$User: Idk

$Me: Well try it.

(She tries it) $User: It works

$Me: Okay well then there's not much we can do if it's already working.

So this time, a full week goes by before we hear from $User again. I've completely forgotten about her PIN pad by this point until I answer the phone:

$Me: (Obligatory Greeting)

$User: Okay, so the PIN pad has words all over it now!

$Me: What?

$User: You guys said that it was supposed to be blank, but now there's words!

$Me: Does it work?

$User: I mean...yes...

$Me: THEN IT'S FINE.

$User: But you guys said it was supposed to be blank!!!!

$Me: It's probably just syncing to the server, it does that every once in awhile. If it works, it works. There's nothing else we can do.

This was about a month ago at this point, haven't heard anything about the PIN pad since then. I mean, I'm going to be honest, we can't even troubleshoot PIN pads, because they JUST WORK. There is NEVER problems with them because they are SUPER simple. Problems with $Software server that uses them? Sure, ton with that. The PIN pads themselves? NEVER. So 4 calls about the same, BRAND NEW PIN pad was probably the worst case of ""helpless user"" I've ever had.

t3_d85xo2,"As the UPS goes, so goes the Network","Hi all, FTP, so sorry about formatting and if this storytelling is a bit lacking please leave your suggestions! Thanks!

When I first started out in IT, I was part of a small IT team supporting a campus of about 5 manufacturing facilities. The company that owned these facilities had a talent for spending as little as possible on redundancy and rejecting our budget requests with the response, ""Just make it work."" This ensuing incident and a few more in short succession changed their minds and actually led to a better understanding of the importance of redundancy and our IT team.

Anyway, down to the story. Its a warm August day, my boss and I were working on a weekend to upgrade a few computers on the manufacturing floor and installing some more security cameras (scope creep on a project that lasted 2 years and could be an entire new story). We walk in the server room after completing that work because it was the coldest room in the building :). We decide to check on the cameras from the server while we are there and as I go to wake up the monitor, we hear a loud BANG from the direction of the main server rack. Just then the entire network goes down. 

When we take a look in the rack, we see the top of the UPS is not flat anymore, no it looks like a dome. As you might have guessed, the company wanted to squeeze as much life out of the batteries as they could, and also didn't have a backup UPS or batteries. We  call the CIO and he decides the best course of action is to call our vendor. When we called our vendor they they said 1 thing that left me utterly bewildered. They advised us to run the core of our network and our servers off of surge protectors, until they could get there on Monday. 

After the call with our vendor, my boss called the CIO to confirm these directions and do a little CYA if this blew up in our faces. And this is how we ended up running our entire core IT infrastructure off of surge protectors for a month, until my boss finally gave up on our vendor and ordered a UPS directly, plus a backup.

As I mentioned at the start, this incident and a couple of incidents involving unplugged surge protectors (oops!) actually caused the company to invest in redundancy and backup hardware for company critical devices. So I guess something good came of it? They still kept and to this day use that vendor though, old  friend of the CIO and all.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d7ka6l,Storage is full.,"I work as a phone repair technician inside of a phone retail store. 

So this lady came in today with an older iPhone, and she wanted to switch over her data to her new iPhone 11. (we've done maybe 50 of these transfers in the last couple days,  it's a small part of what we usually do apart from repairs) This is business as usual, but she tells us that she's been in before and we know there must be something deeper going on making it difficult to transfer. She tells us her daughter had trouble with it and so did one of our coworkers who helped her yesterday. 

So we try 2 or 3 normal methods to transfer her data and nothing is working. Eventually we conclude it's because her storage is full. It won't allow cloud backup or installation of any transfer apps because it's so full. So we work with her to try to find something she can delete. 

Problem is her phone doesn't have any apps that are deletable. Only the default ones. Her looking at her storage reveals that it's all just photos. 

She was super specific she did not want to delete any of her photos because she had family that had passed away and they were very important to her so we didn't want to pry. We try very hard not to snoop peoples personal info and photo galleries but after an hour of trying to work around it, curiosity got the better of me.

She really did have a lot of photos. 28000+ to be specific. I clicked into one of the albums and I was astonished to find it was not photos of her grandchildren at all. The photos were almost entirely product images of jewelry. She saved so many that I was astonished. I looked over at my coworker and scrolled. And then I scrolled faster. And then I scrolled as fast as I could. Yep she had 28000 pictures of FUCKING JEWELRY. There were a few normal pictures scattered about sure, but the vast majority were JEWELRY! 

My coworker looked for another moment stunned. I started laughing. I couldn't contain it, I walked into the back and laughed harder. I was hysterical. We both were. We had to keep quiet because she was still standing at the desk on the other side of the door. It took a good 5 minutes before I was able to face the customer without cracking up.

""Maybe you could take a look at the photos and see if there's anything you can delete?"" As I handed the phone back to her. ""Just as much as you can, maybe that will free up enough space to work with.""

She comes back up to the desk 10 minutes later after deleting 30 photos. What... I imagine she probably went through and was like ""well I'm keeping the jewelry, might as well delete some of my least favorite grandkid""

Obviously 30 photos was not enough space. So we ended up telling her that she would need to delete probably another 100 or so before it would allow it to back up. So she decided to leave and come back later. She didn't even acknowledge the jewelry photos.

This whole interaction was so weird and insane that I am still laughing and scratching my head. What the hell?

TL;DR: Lady has 28,000 stock photos of Jewelry junking up her phone.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_d7d9r3,"Tales from $University Helpdesk: ""What do you mean we had 6 months notice?!""","Background: I work at the technology service desk for a medium-sized state university. We recently transitioned away from the dumpster-fire that is blackboard, which is a third-party service that professors can use to post documents, assignments, and activities, and students can turn in assignments, get grades, submit the occasional form, etc. The replacement is Canvas, which is a third-party service that professors can use to post documents, assignments, and activities, and students can turn in assignments, get grades, submit the occasional form, *but with a cleaner interface*.

The transition was known to faculty and staff about a year-and-a-half to two years ahead of time. About 6 months out, the announcements and reminders became more constant, faculty were sent regular notices that if they needed *anything* that was saved on blackboard to also be on canvas, they would need to download all their documents and media prior to the Blackboard shutoff date in June. After that date, Blackboard will no longer be in service at $University, and any content (syllabuses, assignments, quizzes, etc) would be gone with it.

Come May 30, we start getting calls.

SD: Me/Service Desk

User: Lord Admiral Doctor Professor Ignoramus III, PhD, DFA, MD, MBA, Esq. *who definitely knows how to read*.

&amp;#x200B;

User: So I just got this notice that Blackboard is going away, do you know when that is?

SD: Oh yea, we've been making announcements for \~2 years now. It's going away next week.

User: Well, this is the first I've heard of it. What about all my stuff on there?

SD: That notice you said you got, are you referring to the email that was sent out yesterday?

User: Yes, of course!

SD: Well, per that email, you need to pull whatever it is that you want to save from blackboard so that you can re-upload to Canvas when it goes live.

User: Well, this is the first I've heard of it!! Why wasn't anyone told?!

SD: Do you have your inbox open? Do a quick search for the word Blackboard.

User *types loudly, audibly hunting and pecking for keys:* Well, I've never seen any of these emails before!

SD: But you did receive them. There were also notices on the website as well.

In the end, the deadline was extended for a month because for some reason *literally every professor* ***who totally knows how to read*** *was at an important academic conference and therefore was unable to pull their stuff from blackboard.*

After a couple of weeks of these calls leading up to the extension, things died down. After dealing with the late-90's/early 2000's UX barf that was Blackboard, most people quite liked the cleaner, better organized UI for Canvas, even if professors decided to skip training sessions then complain when they forgot to hit 'publish' and students couldn't access unpublished content.

Then, last week, I had the pleasure of taking this call:

SD: $University Technology Service Desk, how may I help you?

User: Yes, this is $name+2\_Titles\_That\_mean\_*nothing*. Is blackboard gone?!

SD: Yes, we transitioned away from Blackboard about 3 months ago. Canvas went live around that time.

User: So, last semester, I uploaded lesson plans, syllabi, study guides, and other documents to Blackboard.

SD: Uh huh...

User: So why isn't it on Canvas?

SD: Did you upload anything to Canvas?

User: No, it's on Blackboard! You guys were going to move everything for us!

SD: The deadline for pulling your content from Blackboard was in early June, then they extended it a month to give everyone more time to grab what they needed.

User: So, *I* was supposed to download my things and upload them to the new system?

SD: Yes.

User: *Somehow audibly silently raging*

SD: I can transfer you to the Blackboard/Canvas support team if you like..

User: Yes.

t3_d7cbm0,The day I shut down an entire government agency,"So, a little backstory.  This was in '96-'97, and I had been working with this IT services company for only a few months.  We had two customers with large HP 9000 Unix mainframes, I remember at least one of them was about 5 feet tall.  In the back of those enclosures, you could swing open the door and mount rack equipment alongside expansion modules for the mainframe itself.  One of those customers used that space to store network switches and hubs in the rack section, and it was common for us to go into the back of those servers and make changes to network topology, service networking equipment, etc, while the server was still busy humming away.

We had other customers that had TI 1500 Unix servers.  The way these servers were described to me at the time was, quite literally, the ""little brother"" to the bigger HP 9000s.  The enclosures of the TIs looked nearly identical to the HPs, along with the back door that swung open and gave access to the expansion modules, only on a much smaller scale (and unable to store rack equipment like its big brother).

Now, I was not a Unix guy.  By this point, I had dabbled a bit with Linux, but was hired primarily for my knowledge of Windows desktop and NT, Novell, and various LAN and WAN technologies.  We also had Unix specialists on staff, and nearly every one of the companies we had contracts with had their own staff, as well, to take care of these machines.  Suffice it to say, I knew little to nothing on these machines themselves, as I was in the world of Pentium, Pentium Pro, Cyrix, and AMD.  Now, on to the day in question.

One of our clients was a county government agency.  This was a fairly large county, so there was a lot of IT infrastructure involved with their operation.  At this time, they were a Novell network on the PC side and were just introducing Windows NT machines into their server infrastructure, but they also utilized a single TI 1500 that served their main application via green screen terminals (either terminals themselves or via terminal emulation on PC).  We had just done some major changes to their network by deploying some new Windows NT servers and some new switches, and the owner of my company wanted us to go through the server room and the equipment closets and confirm and update our maps of the connections.  As an added bonus, he wanted us to tag the ends of cables with labels that said where that cable was plugged into at the other end.

So, I get there early one morning with a co-worker and set about doing just that.  We started with the equipment closet farthest away from the main server room and began working our way towards the center of their IT universe.  We get nearly all the way through the main server room, and are left with several cables going into the back of the TI 1500 enclosure.  So, we do what we've always done, pop open the back enclosure door and start tracing the network cables leading into the back of it.

We're about halfway done when the IT manager rushed into the room saying that all of the agency locations have crashed.  He walks up to the main terminal, and it's dead.  Passed on.  Ceased to be.  This is an ex-terminal.  He asked what we had been doing before it crashed.  So, we told him.

Turns out, the TI 1500 has a kill switch that shuts off power when you open the enclosure.  So, as we opened the back to map out those connections, we also managed to kill the power to the server and shut down the entire organization in the middle of the workday.  When he asked why we did that even after reading the warning, I said something to the effect of ""Warning?""

There, on the back door of the enclosure, was a large neon green sticker which said, in large print (and I'm paraphrasing from memory), ""DO NOT OPEN THIS ENCLOSURE WHILE THE SERVER IS POWERED ON.""

A few minutes later, everything was back up and running and no damage to equipment or data, so we were finally able to sit back and have a laugh about it.  Both myself and my co-worker are about to celebrate 23 years with the company, and we still have this government agency as a client, although about 10 years or so ago I moved to software development.

TL;DR:  I'm apparently a blind moron who can't read a giant neon green warning sticker.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d7dylo,"No printer? No problems! Get rid of it, please. I will grovel.","Working in general PC remote support, we get a wide variety of calls as one might expect. One type of call that is consistent though is the call for printer assistance. Three different scenarios that made me scratch my head and wish these customers would get the spontaneous urge to go VERY green and decide they don't need a printer. . . 

**The First**

This lady I think was likely the most advanced of the users, she at least already had the printer and computer turned on and such, and I believe she'd already started successfully printing before.

\[*insert normal greetings/introductions of phone call and connection request to computer*\]

As I'm checking Control Printers, I see the printer was already connected to the computer once before at least, but now it showed a status of ""Not Connected"". The lady on the phone was still watching the screen and noticed the same status because she asked:

User1: Yeah that's my printer. It says 'not connected', does that mean it's connected?

M: Uhh, I would have to assume not. . . Is the blue light on the printer solid or flashing? (HP printer)

User1: Flashing.

M: Ah okay. Your printer isn't connected to your network, we'll need to get that connected, then we can properly connect it wirelessly. 

\[*insert fix and end call*\]

Seems she connected it via USB at some point, then disconnected it.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Second**

Customers can obtain our support through a variety of means, one of which is specifically purchasing a card for printer support when they purchase a new printer at $AffiliatedStore. The rule for helping these customers is that they need to know their network information (name/password), and have already taken the printer out of the box and done the initial setup (ink, paper, etc). Our support was purely for the connection between computer and printer, downloading drivers/software etc.

Cue lady who hasn't done that and was under the impression someone would come out to her house:

User2: Hi, I want you to help me set up my printer.

Me: Absolutely, have you taken the printer out of the box, plugged it in, put paper in it, etc?

User2: No, I thought you guys would come out and do that for me.

Me: No, sadly, we're purely remote support, but once you get the printer set up, feel free to give us a call back and we can assist at that point. Just follow the instructions on the printer after you turn it on.

User2: Well hang on hang on, let me get it out of the box. (*oh boy*) 

Me: Oh, yeah just, uh, plug it in and turn it on and it should start taking you through the setup, just give us a call back.

User2: How do I turn it on??

Me: Uh... I'm not sure where the power button is as we support many different printers, but generally it---

User2: I found it, I found it. It's turning on and asking me for a date. What date am I supposed to put in there?? Today's date??

Me: (*muting microphone briefly*) No not today's date, just enter your birthday because that makes sense.... (*unmuting microphone*) Yes, today's date, but ma'am, we don't assist in this part as there's nothing we can really do aside from advise to just follow with what it's asking for. Please just give us a call back once it has the main menu portion.

\[*insert end phone call and big sigh*\]

&amp;#x200B;

**The Third/Final**

This last lady I didn't really have to help very much, but I was pretty baffled.

User3: Hi, I'm looking to set up my new $PrinterInfo, can you help?

Me: Sure! Have you already taken it out of the box, turned it on, done the initial setup?

User3: I took it out of the box, but it won't turn on.

Me: Hmm, okay, did you check to make sure it's plugged in all the way?

User3: What? This thing didn't come with any cords!! They said it was wireless!!

Me: \**stunned silence*\* uh, well... yes, it's wireless connecting to the computer, but... it still needs power.

t3_d7awee,Just 2 small stories...for the price of 1! :D,"Quite a few years back i did workpractice as an automation technician  for a fairly large factory in my home town. And from there. 2 somewhat funny stories arose:

When i met in on my very first morning, i was paired up with one of the automation technicians (AT)  to go help in one of the machinehalls becouse one of the machines ""Wasn't working"" So he grapped his toolbag, and off we went!

We arived at the machinehall, and got to the machine in question with the operator standing next to it. ""All the lights were on in the machine but nothing works"" acording to said operator.

So AT pops open the controll panel to reveal all the wires and relays and what not on the insides, takes his multimeter and begins testing the various connections. (Should be noted, there's a complete set of schematics hanging on the inside of the doorpanel) But everything seems to be in order. So he asks me to hit the startup button, just to see what's going on.

As i'm about to push the button i notice there's a rather large dial, with the words ""Speed"" written above it. So i ofcourse ask AT what speed i should put it on. And out of the corner of my eye i notice the operator facepalming, whilst muttering ""I don't think there's any problems with the machine..."" the AT just chuckles ""Yea, think we're done here then"" And we went back. Nothing dramatic or anything, just...fun :D

The other one though, was a bit more dramatic.   
The other story happened when i had been there for about two weeks. We were called over to the RND department becouse all of their power had gone. So i head out with another AT to find and fix the problems.

We get there, and yup, no power anywhere. So we find the powerbox and see that the HPFI relay (A safety masterswitch kinda thing) had popped, so we flick it back on and pop, it goes again. We then pop all of the fuses, and turn the HPFI back on, no problems there, and begin plugging the fuses in again, untill the HPFI went out and thus we had found the culprit. A quick  glance over the schematics relaved that the wireset in question was ofcourse...the one that controlled the cieling ventilators, which were located on top of the building...no reason for this to be easy.

I inform all of the engineers and general RND personal that we'll be doing stuff with the power so don't turn on your machines or anything untill we give the okay for it. AT then handed me a radio and headed up and began checking the wires. Problem was fairly simple, some debres in the ventilatorshaft had damages some wires which had enabled the groundwire to touch the phase. Which in turn pops the HPFI. 

AT calls me on the radio and asks me to turn on the power, so i do so. He then does some work up there now that it's been confirmed that this was the issue (Mostly just clearing away debres, calling the boss to inform him what the problem was and wether we should just give it a patchwork, or replace the wires intirely. And after maybe 3-4 minutes calls me to turn the power back off, so i do that.  
Maybe ten seconds later, one of the RND folks comes running out, screeching about ""Why the power went out again?""  
Me: Becouse i turned it off?  
RND: But why'd you do that?! my machine was in the middle of its bootup!  
Me: Becouse..uh...i was asked to?  
RND, snaps the radio from my hand: I don't know who's on the other line, but get down here now!   
AT then hurries his butt down to where i'm at, and looks at RND  
RND: There you are, why'd you have the power turned off? you're the one who told me my machine don't take well to getting suddenly shut down like that!  
AT: Wait, you turned your machine on..why?  
RND: Becouse the power was back on? thought you guys were done!  
Then insued 5 minutes of absolute mayhem, AT began shouting at RND, who began shouting back.

It wasn't untill the head of RND called the boss from the automation technician department, that they both calmed down.  
But in the end, RND was repremanted for having turned his equipment on when told not to, suppose that's something?",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d7bgyh,Stuck in SAP,"I used to be a software developer at $OldFirm before becoming a software developer at $NewFirm just because I got tired of being micromanaged and the straight man of the team I was on for eight months. Here is one of my stories \*dun dun\*:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;$Boss: ""Hey, I need you to learn SAP""  
$Me: \*insert blank stare\*

You see, my boss at $OldFirm wasn't exactly the funniest clown in the circus. He seemed that way, but had a problem for overlooking important details (i.e. signing off on a project to get data from a DB into our application without asking if the client had the local version or the cloud version, but that's a different project). You know, the sh\*t that made my job infinitely harder. Anyhow, I digress from that.

My boss had a bad habit of Googling things for me, sending me the links, and thinking he had found Jesus or Buddha or something. Turns out we were integrating the cloud version of our product with a school district's SAP installation. It was a cool $50k contract if I recall correctly, and I was tasked with doing a POC that our $DocManager could connect to SAP. Wasn't too difficult to do as I used to be a Java developer (and now am again) and could work my way around Servlets decently well. For this story, we were tasked to build a form (that would save in $DocManager and send the data to SAP) for people to apply for transcripts. Yeah, it wasn't fun.

First and foremost, we developed two versions of the form. We had my gorgeous Bootstrap version that had the issue of creating two documents in $DocManager and had a few bugs to fix up that I was hoping our client leads could help fix up as I got back to better things such as managing the dumpster fire known as SAP-$DocManager integration, and the version one of our client leads developed that looked like the results of my breakfast 24 hours later.

Back to the SAP of the story. Well, the SAP integration was going ...not great. $School didn't have any resources to develop a web API on their end, and we didn't on ours because (and this is relevant to the next story) WE WERE A .NET SHOP. In comes our $ProjectManager who is accurately described by this one anecdote:

&gt;$ProjectManager: Wow, everything didn't burn down. I should go on vacation more often!  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me (internally, of course): Or just go on vacation ever...

Well, in comes $ProjectManager with her asking dumb questions (mostly to appease the client, but the client should know the answer):

&gt;$ProjectManager: What are we going to do to help $School get this done?  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me (internally): Well, short of asking $OldFirm to pay to get me SAP certified (which they won't do for monetary reasons), nothing because that's all we can do.

Sadly, I don't know how that project ended. I quit before it was over. Got tired of all the micromanagement and watching my boss accidentally (I hope) torpedo a project and mention if it doesn't work we can ask the client for more cheddah cheese. Sure, $NewFirm has problems but boy do I not miss looking behind me whenever someone walks by.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d76g3k,Many creative uses of Excel,"TLDR version:  Customer wants to use Excel as a CRM and demands a microsoft developer to reprogram Excel to behave as a CRM.

&amp;#x200B;

Cast of Characters:  Me-Me, a manager at an IT company.  CUS - Customer  Manager- My boss

So CUS has spent weeks cussing our company out because we wont ""fix"" his Excel that we sold him in the O365 package deal.  Emails back and forth in our ticketing system until the customer finally explodes and demands a manager to address his issue.

CUS has demanded to speak with Microsoft.  We've put him in contact with Microsoft no less than 10 times.  He emails into our ticketing system raging about the accents of the people at Microsoft, that they dont call him at the specific time he's requested for a callback or he isnt available for the callback.  Each time he's talked with Microsoft, they say very clearly that reprogramming Excel to do what he wants is not within their scope, but he's not hearing it.

So what does CUS want.  He wants someone to reprogram Excel to allow a checkin/checkout system (much like how Onedrive sharing or other file server sharing works but he wants it built into the individual program itself)  A way to insert photos and unalterable signatures and timestamps for his courier service.  Sound like a program anyone knows of? LOL.  And this guy spends about 20 bucks a month with our company.  He's hardly big enough of a fish to demand dev level contact with Microsoft.

So Me gets on the phone with this customer complaining about the accents of the people at Microsoft, how they wont call him, etc.  I stated to him that I was sorry but what he wanted was out of our scope, and even out of the support that Microsoft provides.  They only offer the support for the product to work as its designed to work, not to completely redesign their program just for him.   Apparently he didnt like this answer and started screeching at me that I was unhelpful, rude, how he couldnt understand people at Microsoft, how they're the evil empire, etc.

CUS:  ""I demand to speak to the owner of your company!""

Me:  I'm sorry, but I cant do that.

CUS ""Then let me speak to your manager!  I demand that you make this product work!  You sold it to me!""

Me:  ""What you want sir is something like Salesforce or Zendesk.  You need a CRM, not Excel to do what you're doing""

CUS  ""You sold me this product!  I demand your manager!""

Me:  Ok it will take a few minutes to get him

CUS:  I'll hold!

20 minutes later of this customer listening to some of the world's worst hold music (I hate our company's hold music)

Manager:  Manager here, how can I help?

CUS:  This witch is telling me I need to buy more things!  I demand to speak to the developers at Microsoft!   I need to do... (he lists off everything that something like Zendesk can do very well)

Manager:  Sir, I hear what you're saying but even we cant make Microsoft redesign their product.  A better product for you is one that we dont even sell.  But they're designed specially for what you're looking to do, they do this all of the time even for companies like Uber and Postmates.

CUS:  I've been going back and forth with your company for weeks and now you're telling me I have to buy more things!  I demand to speak with the company's owner or I'm calling my lawyer!

Manager:  That's fine sir, our legal team's email address is emailaddresshere.  But your lawyer is not going to make Excel do what you want.  A CRM program will.  Is there anything else

CUS:  I demand...

Manager:  I told you I cant do that, I gave you our legal team's email.  I also provided an alternate solution from a company that we get no benefit from just to help you with your project.  At this point this case is resolved.  Have a good day.

t3_d6vd6h,ID10T user kills computer with phone line,"So back before there was Cable Internet there was DSL, and before that there was Dial-up. I worked at a Dial-up ISP and was on the escalations team. ----Enough back story. 

Here is the cast:

Me is well me

CW: is Co-worker

ID10T User is customer on the phone.

On to the story. 

So it was the day after Christmas and I was working the escalations desk and one of my co-workers comes to me with an issue.

It seams that ID10T user had called in because he was having some connections issues. He had just got a brand new, out of the box,  Gateway computer. I know it was that long ago. Now when he was setting it up and when he got to connecting the phone line to the internal dial-up modem he found that the RJ11 connecter was not on the end of the line. 

Now being the smart and resourceful user he is does he go and buy a new phone line??????
Nope, if he did he would not be calling my co-worker. He striped the end of the wires that make up the phone line and sticks it in to the modem port. 

Now most people don’t know that phone lines carry around 48 volts down them to supply the phone’s ringer with power.  

Well my Co-worker tell me this and said that the ID10T user wanted to talk to above her. So I have her transfer the call to me and talk to the guy. 

$Me: Hello sir I understand that you having an issue with your computer connecting to the internet?

$ID10T User: Ya, I plugged the phone line in to the modem and turned the computer on and there was a loud popping and smoke started to come from the hard drive and the monitor. Your internet killed my computer. What are you going to do to make it work?

$ME: Well sir I was informed that you striped the wires in the phone line and plugged that right in to the modem, is that right?

$ID10T user: Ya……..So?

$ME: Well sir there is about 48 volts that is in that phone line. What YOU have done is fry your computer. The voltage has fried the modem, monitor, motherboard, the processor, and the ram. You have turned you computer in to a very expensive paperweight. 

$ID10T user: What are you going to do to fix it. 

$ME: There is nothing I can do to FIX the issue, you broke the computer’s warranty when you did what you did. You will have to try to contact Gateway or the place you got the computer from to see if can be fixed. 

$ID10T user: What do I tell them?

$ME: Well sir that is up to you, I can not tell to lie to them but will have to talk to them to get it fixed.

t3_d6km3g,The Day of the Cactus,"From my nightmares and the mid 2000s. I give you, The Day of the Cactus.

It's a nice quiet morning in the call center in L2 support at a major US telecom. It's a Saturday.

It's around 11:00AM . I clocked on almost 3 hours ago and I've taken a whopping 2 calls. Only one of those needed troubleshooting, the other was simple. It's so slow our team is gathered around in a ground yakking and playing games rather than at our respective stations.

The room is pretty small, only about 25 people in the room fully staffed. About half that are in the room.

Up on the wall is a gigantic map of the United States, made up of LEDs. Most of the map is green, this indicates everything is normal. A few parts are yellow, this means trouble has been reported but the system is still responding. A few red spots and dots here and there, indicating outages.

I've got my shoes off with my feet up on my desk reading a book.

All in all, it's a wonderfully relaxing day.

Then it all went wrong. Terribly wrong.

First was the beeping alarms, which none of us knew existed. What the hell is that god-awful racket coming out of EVERY terminal?!

Then I see the wall, and my heart has stopped for a moment.

California, from the middle to Los Angeles, has gone red.

Millions of people are out of service.

In the room we are staring at the map, the computers and each other. Then headsets start beeping as people start receiving calls. I get a call. Within a minute there are HUNDREDS of calls in my queue, the general queue is in the HIGH THOUSANDS and climbing rapidly.

My system has populated an account from the Los Angeles area. Customer is pissed, has no service whatsoever. I try and cannot get a response from his phone. Actually, NOTHING will respond, it's like a meteor has destroyed Southern California, except I'm on a landline with someone right now.

The entire call center is slammed, I have to tell my customer I'll give a call back then put myself into ""Not Ready"" to start investigating what the hell is going on. Nobody in the room knows anything yet.

The problem is in the GSM network, everything else is working. I can reach all the equipment, but all GSM traffic falls into a black hole of unresponsiveness.

Someone shouts! There it is! There is a station not responding along Interstate 5! It's COMPLETELY unresponsive, like I can't even talk to the internet equipment and that is very not good. It's *the* link between the halves of the state. The rest of the network does NOT appreciate this link being down either, problems are widespread as the system tries, but cannot handle the load. Other systems are now being affected.

Emergency dispatch technicians to the area to determine what the hell is going on. My Nortel has the call queue in the 10's of thousands. The previously laid back atmosphere in the room is now grim as death.

Agonizing, useless incoming escalation after escalation where I can't tell them ANYTHING useful grinds on. People are very unwilling to hang up the damn phone without any kind of answers. It's grueling and repetitive.

Finally word (and pictures) come back from the dispatched technicians.... There *is* no relay station. It's gone the way of Alderaan.

A truck driver with a fully loaded trailer fell asleep at the wheel and drove off the highway. He made it way off the road and plowed straight through our gigantic fake cactus and associated hardware of a relay station. Obliterated, nothing to fix and the site isn't even usable. Sweet Jesus.

The whole time, I'm fielding calls that I obviously can't do anything about and people are *pissed*. (I actually did get ONE call from someone NOT in the affected area who waited through that queue, only one out of hundreds, but it was a welcome relief.)

So this is how we got to learn to build and deploy a mobile relay station. It took a crazy effort between teams to build out the equipment, then figure out how to deploy. By the end of my nightmare shift, the link was functioning and was literally a van-network parked around the brutalized remains of a giant fake cactus and outbuilding. Things were finally coming under control around the time I left and the queue was emptying.

By the time I walked out the doors, about a hundred two-minute long calls later, I felt like I'd run a marathon. Physically and mentally exhausted. I don't even remember the drive home. My head hit the pillow before the sun had set. The Day of the Cactus, was finally over.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d6kn5g,Do the simple checks first,"About 40 years ago I worked as a ""system programmer"" for a company that in one line of business made video terminal controllers for IBM mainframes. One of our customers was having trouble with theirs and a series of ""experts"" was flown out to the customer to solve the problem. I was one of the people sent. 

The customer had a  [IBM 360/50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360_Model_50) in rather grungy shape, as they allowed smoking in the machine room. Their support contractor (3rd party, not IBM) and I agreed this was bad and the customer should be told to clean things up. But the problem seemed to be that the terminal controller kept randomly dropping offline. We went through all sorts of diagnostics and began to suspect an error in the mainframe's processing of peripheral interrupts. Luckily I had recently read Bell and Newell's book on computer architectures and the 360/50 was one of the case studies they presented, so I was familiar with the /50's inner workings. But I needed the book.

A phone call back to the office told the next engineer who was flying out the next day to bring along the copy of this book I knew to be in the corporate library. With it in hand I was able to read the technical diagrams and microcode listings that IBM helpfully provides in big binders in a wheeled rack along with the computer. Turning to the relavant circuit diagram, I observed pencil notations around the suspected cicrcuitry. ""Aha! Somebody has been here before! The plot thickens!"" The support guy said it was not him. At one point I am reduced to not only single-stepping the 360/50 through its interrupt handler, but *micro*-single-stepping it and watching the blinking lights. That is, I was single-stepping through the 360/50s *microcode*.  Still could not catch the problem.  (Can you imagine Intel allowing anyone to do that today?  Or even providing the documentation necessary to do it, much less the ""user interface""?)

Then taking a break, I am staring at our terminal controller, a short rack about 1 meter tall placed near the mainframe when all of a sudden its display panel shows it is restarting, all by itself. Huh? Why would it do that? A check with the design engineers tell me it would do that if it had a power interruption. 

Smelling a rat, we follow its power cord to see where it was plugged in.  Turns out, whoever had installed it plugged it into a convenience outlet in the computer room that was intended for the janitorial staff to use with their vacuum cleaner. This outlet proved to have rather dirty power that would get particularly nasty spikes whenever the building elevator started moving.

We had the side panels of the 360/50 open at this point and I observed a power outlet inside. The support guy said it is filtered power from the 360/50's internal power supply, and they use it to plug in test equipment.  We unplugged the terminal controller from its dodgy outlet, we lifted some floor tiles, and rerouted the power cord over to the mainframe and plugged it into this filtered outlet. Problem solved.",talesfromtechsupport

Yesterday one of our sales reps emails and say ""Every time I call my office number it says ""No Longer in Service"". Me being the good phone guy I am, dial her number through Skype and get her voicemail. Then to double check I pull out the Development cell phone (not giving her my REAL number lol) and call. I get her voicemail again. Perfect, ticket closed....

But wait...there's more.

This morning I get an angry call from the ladies boss because I didn't fix the problem. Me, being the incredibly polite and articulate person I am (sarcasm) said ""I ain't fixed da problem because there ain't no problem!!!""  He told me ""she called her number and still gets the message ""no longer in service"". I say ""Okay"" and agree to see what's wrong. I call the number again and get the ladies voicemail. Call the boss back, number works fine. Lady still INSISTS it doesn't. I ask the boss to call the number...SURPRISE!!! it works fine. Lady STILL insists she gets the same message. I finally ask her what number she is calling and she has transposed two of the numbers. Big deal, we've all done it. I tell her the correct number and she SWEARS that she has been getting calls on the transposed number for the last 6 months. She INSISTS that I am wrong and she is going to let he boss know and I need to fix it NOW!

This is where it starts getting fun...since I'm terribly wrong, I ask her to check her email signature. It has the correct phone number. I was told ""I must've changed it"" (yeah lady, whatever) so since I ""changed it"" I asked her to check the number on her business cards. I must've changed those too (damn, I'm good since I'm 1800 miles away and just got this ticket yesterday)! I closed her ticket (again) with ""could not duplicate""  and then my CIO called me in his office because the lady called him directly because I'm unprofessional (true) and unhelpful (probably also true) and I got to explain the problem to him. He laughed, shook his head and told me to quit pissing people off and I said ""but boss...it's only 9am. The day is just getting started. Don't put those kinds of constraints on me this early!"" He laughed again and told me to GET OUT and go back to work.

t3_d6lb6f,What are we here for then?,"You ever find yourself in a dead end job that you find one that seems almost too good to be true, so you jump on it only to find out it's only marginally better than the dead end you just left? Well that was my last gig. I was hired to be part of a team that was working as a vendor to do on-site L1 internal tech support for a major healthcare company. I had been with them for about 7 months at the point in this incident.

An employee calls in because they were having trouble with their account in one of their programs &amp; had previously reported it. I looked over the ticket thinking that maybe one of us missed something. I noticed the ticket was about a month old at this point and no ticket notes had been added by the assigned group since we assigned it to them. It's well passed the suggested SLA for that group &amp; we were under orders to only be on a call for no more than 15 minutes, so couldn't do too much troubleshooting to try and help the poor guy out. The program was vital to his position and his boss was starting to get very angry he wasn't able to do his job for a month.

I notice that I was getting close to our call time limit, so I mention that I'll send a email to the group asking for an update on the ticket and to have them follow-up with the caller. You can hear he isn't happy that it's not resolved still (probably because his boss was going to still be mad), but understands that at least I'm trying to help the guy out anyway I can. I sent out the email with a CC to my team lead and their boss as well so they're in the loop of this &amp; do a bit of CYA.

The next morning I got an email from the department head that I couldn't believe &amp; my cubical neighbors couldn't believe either. I was being yelled at for ""taking initiative"" in helping the caller &amp; how we shouldn't. We all looked at each other were in complete shock as to what we were reading. My direct team lead didn't come in till later on in the day, so I flagged down one of the other leads that I was friendly with and had him read over the email &amp; he couldn't believe what I was being yelled at for either. It was at that moment we all realized that we weren't in a tech support role, or even a customer service call center roll, but a glorified switchboard. It was also at that moment that I knew I couldn't last there much longer and made sure my resume was updated and posted on multiple job sites by my lunch break.

Turns out that not only did we have that time limit, but the lead's boss told us that the most important person is the last one in the call queue, not the one I'm on the phone with. Thankfully, I did get a much better job a few months later &amp; they know how a tech support queue is handled.

t3_d6gvwc,The Dungeon of RCA," Gather close my friends for the tale I tell is one fraught with danger, intrigue, and suspense. We join our plucky SAN admin as she embarks on an epic quest to clear the Dungeon of RCA!

As usual, our plucky SAN Admin, Peach, (full BOFH creds) was bright and perky, but that day especially.  She had acquired one Junior BOFH,  who had not passed all of his BOFH certifications, but was working arduously on them, and one pimply faced youth to help her manage her 13PB kingdom, and they, after another arduous journey (a tale for another time) had acquired keys to half of the kingdom, Gold and Europium .  They were now approved to go on quests of their own, instead of tagging along behind clapping coconuts.

Junior BOFH was given the task of the caring and feeding of the hardware dragons.  Now, as we all know, hardware dragons can be tricky beasts.  If feed properly, and groomed, they sleep through the day, but if angered, the Gods themselves cower.  The production SVC dragon living in Gold, owned by the Lord of Gold, had a failed battery on one it's nodes, and was very upset the wound had not been addressed in 12 days.  Why, you ask, would someone leave a poor dragon in agony for 12 days??  Well, the bean counter in charge of warranties forgot to renew the maintenance contract and Junior BOFH was unable to acquire the battery.  

Finally, the contract renewed, the Junior BOFH contacted the doctor to come repair the SVC dragon.  He created the proper incident for tracking, and the appropriate paperwork known as an expedited change record, and waited to hear from the doctor to agree on a time to fix the dragon.  The doctor, deciding the Junior BOFH was too junior, contacted the Lord of Gold instead.  They agreed on a time, and the LOG informed Peach, and her squires of the time, had already raised the incident to a Severity 1, and requested an emergency change be raised as the SVC dragon could forget some wisdom imparted should the 2nd battery fail, and the node go down gracelessly.  

The Junior BOFH did not fear as he felt he was up to the task of working with the doctor to mend the Golden SVC dragon, but he had never worked on an SVC dragon before and the doctor had asked him to power off the node to prevent further damage to the dragon, but never fear, Peach was there!  She gave him the proper GUI procedure, Select the failed node, Right click on the Node, Power off and the dragon will be mollified.  Easy peasy.

No, as we all know, the Elder Gods of Tech Support love a good laugh from time to time, and you should not tempt them by saying such things as Easy Peasy.  Our Junior BOFH selected the node, right clicked on what he thought was the node, selected power off, did not understand the message the SVC dragon was trying to give him, lulled the dragon with a sleep treat (code), and promptly put the dragon to sleep.

Now, this dragon was important for a number of reasons as it controlled a great deal of treasure, including, but not limited to, the connection to the trading house known as Wall Street.  This connection was down for 45 min while the dragon was revived (2 min), and the power of reboot was used to bring the connection back online(43 min), however the damage to the kingdom had been done, and Peach, poor Peach, must now enter the Dungeon of RCA, where there is much sorrow and nashing of teeth and it is unknown if she will ever return.

TL;DR New guy has his mouse over the wrong area, selects power off for the entire SVC cluster, takes down trading, among other things, for a very, very big client.  Fallout is unsure as I'm still dealing with the RCA process, but lets just say, big executives are involved.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d6c9r2,You know how more people create more problems?,"So I work at a video bridging services company, which basically hosts the video conferences of other companies. We have a reservation system wherein customers let us know which conferences need to take place. We have a customer support team that answers the phone and e-mail and solves simple connection problems. We also get a lot of calls about reservations though, about changing dates, times, locations, about cancellations, new reservations, etc. etc. It causes some problems that we are not able to focus on the technical difficulties anymore because of all this communication about reservations.

Management decides the phone will now first be answered by a newly hired lady first. This lady will handle the call herself if it concerns a reservation issue, but will put it through to us if it concerns a technical issue. She has no access to the servers and no technical knowledge.

I get a call from her on one day. It´s customer x, they are having a really important meeting and one party complains they cannot see or hear anything. Right away I see that the connection on our bridge is fine. The other party can see them, our bridge can see them, our bridge can see the other party. Video and audio is sent both ways, from and to both systems. I have a hunch what the problem is already, but the customer asks me to disconnect and reconnect the site that cannot see anything just to see if it fixes the problem. I tell him I am very sure it won´t help and that I need him to walk into the room with the video system. He (I know) does not want to go back in there while there is still an issue. He needs to have it solved when he walks back in he tells me.

While the customer is on the phone. I get a new call from the newly hired lady on my videosystem. She pops in to say she has a new call saying I should just do what they ask and disconnect and reconnect. She has another customer asking the same thing as well. So now I have three people telling me the same thing. They are stressed and getting angrier by the second. None of them know as much as I do about the video connection, but who the fuck am I right? So I give in, albeit blunt, ¨Allright both systems have been disconnected and reconnected, please call back when you want me to solve the actual problem¨, and I hang up. Everyone hangs up.

Five minutes later the original caller calls back and asks me to have another look. I let him walk into the room with the video system, point him towards a button he needs to push and all of a sudden the connection comes to life. 

Why,? The video system has a separate screen with built in speakers (I wish I could control all that remotely), which was on sleep mode.

t3_d61m66,But you're the IT department!,"Ever since getting into IT I get asked for help with people's networks, computers, printers, etc. all the time. Most of the time if they're family or a close friend I'll do it for free. I had a few people I work with ask me to come to their house and set up their new computer. Their *personal* computer that they keep at their *house* and don't use for work.

""Ok, my rate is $50 an hour, but I'll cut it to $35 since I know you.""

""Wait, you're gonna charge me?""

""Yes. This is a side business.""

""But we work together and you're in the IT department. It should be free.""

""Is this a work computer?""

""No, but you're in the IT department.""

""Yes, I'm in the IT department at your *work.* If this is a personal computer then I charge for my time because I'm not getting paid by the company to work on your stuff outside business hours.""

This lady told her boss I ""wasn't willing to do \[my\] job"" and help with her computer, conveniently leaving out that it was a personal computer at her house. Her boss came into my office and said ""Karen said you wouldn't help with her computer. Why not?""

""Wait, she wanted help with her own personal computer? Not her work computer?""

""Exactly.""

Her boss then goes off and tells her that the IT department doesn't do house calls and if she wants help she'll have to pay someone.

t3_d6363a,"Issues with TeamViewer and how ""Sh***ing in the shower isn't the approved process either""","The IT department where I work use TeamViewer (TV) to remote into user PCs.  Most IT staff use the full version, while the host version is installed on all other PCs, RDS environments, and mobile devices.  In the case of desktops and laptops, the host is pushed down automatically by a software deployment server, and a .reg is run to apply certain settings.  A security group excludes computers from having this version pushed down.

The company recently switched their hardware supplier, which has meant new laptops will be off the Dell variety, rather than Lenovo.  As I understand it, part of the deal with this supplier involved getting decent discounts on kit, as long as we spent *x* amount of money on our first order.  Who better to treat with new kit than the IT department themselves.  Thus a large order was placed for a load of 17"" Dell Precision Laptops, kitted out with 512GB nVME SSDs, 1TB HDDs, 32GB RAM, i7 processors, etc, for all the company's developers, infrastructure engineers, and on call service desk staff.  I'm somehow getting one too, as my role is classified as a *mobile*, even though I've spent maybe 10 days over the last year at sites other than my own.  Though I guess I do work from home 1-2 days a week ...

The IT team in another office was tasked with the project of building them all.  They use a basic image from a WDS environment, which installs the operating system, runs a few scripts, and adds the computer to the domain, and a few applications are pushed down from a software deployment server over the next few hours, and the rest is installed manually.  Kinda tedious, but pretty simple.

But the team started to have issues with these new laptops.  The OS was meant to be installed on the SSD, but WDS was installing it on the HDD.  It turned out that this was because BIOS or something in the system defined the HDD as Disk 0, and the WDS image was configured to install the OS on Disk 0.  Despite it being possible to disable the HDD in the BIOS, forcing the OS to install on the SSD, the team chose to go for a slightly more tedious solution.  They'd open the laptops up, physically disconnect the HDD, install the image, turn the laptop off, and then plug the HDD back in.

This was the process that was decided upon, which I saw because I'm included in the service desk distribution list as I help them out with automating stuff through PowerShell.  The service desk on my site all concurred that this was a stupid process and they wouldn't follow it if they ever come to building one of these new laptops.

But whatever.  Not my department.  Not my office.  Not my problem.

After the team had built a few test laptops, sent them out to a few testers, and solved a couple of issues they had encountered, they ramped up *production*.  On day three, two staff they deployed images to 14 laptops, and figured they could get the rest of the software installed on them the next day.  But, the next day, they discovered a problem.

They had left the laptops on overnight to download updates and such and, in the process, the host version of TV had been installed.  They tried to uninstall TV, but were unsuccessful.  'TeamViewer is already running, please close and try again' was the error, or something to that effect.  *'But we have closed TV!'*  The problem was that a second process runs along with TeamViewer.exe.  It's called 'TeamViewer_Service.exe'.  And they never realised this.  So their solution to the problem they had on these 14 laptops was to apply a registry edit to stop TeamViewer running on startup, then restart the computer, and then uninstall TeamViewer.

Once TV had been uninstalled, they were free to install the full version of TV, log in with the company license, and then continue with the rest of the build.  They did this on a couple of laptops, and then handed them out to users that were based on their site.  But these laptops were soon returned.  Why?  Because they hadn't put them in the security group that prevents the host version of TV being pushed down.  So the software deployment server had scanned the PC, discovered they have the wrong version of TV installed, closed the **TWO** processes, and then proceeded to uninstall it, then reinstall the ~~correct~~ host version.  By this time, the users of the initial trial laptops had returned them to the team for fixing as well.

By the time the team found out what had happened, over half the laptops they've upgraded to the full version of TV have reverted to the host version.  So they added the laptops to the correct security group, made the registry edit to stop the **TWO** processes launching on startup again, restarted the laptops, uninstalled the host version of TV, and then installed the full version.  They were now four days into this project and every laptop they had issued had been returned to them.  Four days and not a single successful laptop build.  And they sent out another email to the service desk, informing everyone of the *new* process.

But whatever.  Not my department.  Not my office.  Not my problem.

Day five went well.  They issued nearly all the laptops they had built, and started to install WDS images onto more.  But, towards the end of the day, they had a couple more laptops returned to them.  What was the issue?  The options page in TV was locked behind a password.  And the standard password didn't work.  This password is used for configuring a custom static password for remote access, disabling the standard password all the PCs in the company have.  This is something the IT teams liked to have.  It also allowed them to restrict the default level of access when sharing their screen, something they liked for when showing other team members something, without allowing them access to control their computer.  And nobody in the team knew, or could figure out, what the password was.

This password was set by the .reg that was run when the host version was pushed down by the software deployment server.  And the team didn't know how to revert the changes.  In their defence, they did ask infrastructure, who would have been able to supply the .reg, but they were fobbed off with a non answer.  Faced with no idea of how to revert these registry changes, they began to completely rebuild all the laptops they had built so far, and announced the new process in an email to everyone on the service desk and in infrastructure.  It spanned half of one of my screens, but the gist of it was:

&gt;If a PC or laptop has the Host version of TeamViewer installed, but the user requires the Full version of TeamViewer, a full rebuild of the PC or laptop will be required to revert the registry changes made as part of the automatic deployment of the host version.
&gt;
&gt;Ensure that the PC or laptop has been placed in the necessary Security Group to prevent installation of the Host version of TeamViewer, else you'll have to rebuild the PC or laptop again.

But whatever.  Not my department.  Not my office.  Not my problem?  Nah.  I wasn't going to stay out of this one.

You see, this is an issue the team on my site had faced.  In their team, which actually spanned three sites, they had had three leavers in as many months earlier in the year.  And they had encountered a similar problem when building a desktop and laptop for two of the new starters brought in to replace the leavers.  And they came to me for help.  I did a little bit of investigating, and spoke to a few of the infrastructure engineers to figure out how the deployment of TV worked.  In the process, I got hold of the .reg file that applied the standard company settings for the host version of TV.

The .reg made changes to a load of values in about 10 subkeys.  So reverting these changes was simple; simply remove the subkeys.  They'll be recreated when you reinstall TV, and most of them are likely deleted when you uninstall TV (not all, obviously, or the issues above wouldn't have occurred).  But there's no need to actually check which ones are there and which ones aren't.  Just put change each [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\...] or whatever to [-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\...], and every single change would be reverted, leaving you with a clean slate to install the correct version of TV on.

Thus my solution to the problem consisted of six simple steps:

1. Log in as domain admin  
2. Run a PowerShell script to add the computer to the necessary security group  
3. Run a .bat to TASKKILL TeamViewer.exe and TeamViewer_Service.exe  
4. Uninstall the current version of TeamViewer  
5. Run a .reg script that reverts the changes made to the registry by the software deployment server  
6. Install the new version of TeamViewer

I hit 'Reply to all' on the email, and put in the path to the above three scripts, along with a little description of what they do.  There were actually six files, rather than three.  The files for steps 1, 4 and 6 were text files, named after what needed to be done at each step.  And the three scripts were numbered 2, 3, and 5, named simply 'run this'.

A few minutes later, the guy that sent the original email, explaining the process, replies to all to say 'your 6 steps have not been tested and are not guaranteed to work'.  He goes on to explain that I'm not authorised to dictate what processes the service desk and infrastructure should use, and that his process had been approved by both the heads of the service desk and infrastructure.

Cue the greatest email I've ever read, sent to the entirety of the service desk and infrastructure teams, including their managers, **edit: from a member of one of the other service desk teams**:

&gt;Shitting in the shower isn't the approved process either, but it uses less water than a toilet flush making it environmentally friendly, and leaves you with a cleaner finish than rubbing hour hole with toilet paper as well.
&gt;
&gt;If it works, it works.  And this looks hella faster than rebuilding a computer from scratch.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks, cockadoodleinmyass!

The on site service desk team behind me burst out laughing, and began to call other members of IT over to read his response.  And, soon after, the head of infrastructure replied.

&gt;While I wouldn't approve with your anecdote, I agree with your principle.  If it works, do it.  That's all the approval I gave [original email sender] for his process.  I've had a look through the scripts and they look good.  The above steps will probably take about 5 minutes to run, rather than countless hours of a full rebuild.

t3_d5zcba,"No I'm not spying on you, but I guess I could","I work as the Jack-of-all-Trades IT guy for a medium-sized business. One of my most recent actions was to stop using Teamviewer (which we weren't paying for) and since we didn't have the budget (nor the need honestly) for a license and after getting approval from management, I deployed Winvnc on all our machines. Free remote control software that is pretty easy to deploy and works well in a LAN, that's all we needed. Everything was working smoothly and I was pretty happy with myself.

...Until one of our sales guy came to me asking ""Hey OP, what is this icon that appeared recently in the bottom right corner ?""

Me : ""Oh it's the new remote control software I just deployed.""

Him : ""Some guys downstairs looked it up on google and they think management is spying on us with this""

Me (*Confused*) : ""What ? No, i'm the only one having access to it anyway, and i only use it for remote support""

Him : ""But it can be used for spying right ? They found some stories about it""

Me : ""Well... I guess technically it could since it can remotely take control of any PC he's deployed in, but management doesn't have access to it, and I'm only using it for remote control. Besides that would be completely illegal""

Fortunately my explanations convinced him, but still, out of curiosity I googled ""winvnc spying"" (in my language) to see what they stumbled upon...Turns out there are A LOT of stories about unethical use of the software. It never occurred to me how easily I could use it for spying, so I guess my users kinda have a point there.

In the end, I told my users that the day I'll spy on them, I won't use a software with an icon that looks like a mix between Sauron and the Illuminati. I think that convinced them.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d64ybn,Who needs 64-bit Office when I can just clear up disk space? - thought process of my co-worker,"Back at it again with my tech illiterate co-worker. I've been swamped with tickets lately - 1. because my co-worker always works from home meaning she gets paid to do nothing while I do all the work and 2. my coworker has no idea what she is doing when she actually works on tickets. To solve the first issue, I decided to have tickets be assigned to us individually so we know who is working on what. I decided on this after I realised I closed 8 tickets while she closed 3 (all the same difficulty level).  


Yesterday, a ticket came in about someone needing a solution for their slow computer since they were working on high-importance spreadsheets. I gave them a loaner laptop a couple weeks ago, but it seems that didn't work out. So they put in another ticket asking for other solutions. When I was about to message my manager about getting an upgrade approved, my co-worker said she would work on it and she assigned it to herself (since all other tickets were assigned to me showing she wasn't doing much). I told her that was fine but she needs to get with the manager about getting an upgrade approved (they were on Windows 7 32-bit 4GB RAM). She said 'ok'. About an hour later I check on the ticket... her resolution 'I cleared up some disk space. Let me know if you still have problems'. aka she didn't do what I told her to do

The user didn't reply. Instead, the next day, we get an e-mail from the freaking CIO asking about the situation of the ticket saying the user needs to be taken care of immediately since the user has critical work that has a deadline of THIS FRIDAY. So the ticket gets escalated to create a new VM for them with Windows 10, 64-bit, and 8GB RAM.   


There ends up being trouble spinning up the VM, so it comes back to me to get a spare Windows 10 desktop and update it to meet the required specs. I end up having to stay over because of it.

Guess I shouldn't have suggested assigning tickets to ourselves, since it got us in this clusterfuck.",talesfromtechsupport

I got hired by a family friend to make a website, and we agreed that i will be making a website for him for around the costs of 500€.

We singed a contract just to make sure we had that on paper, and ofcourse me being me i assumed that he had some sort of Web / Computer infrastructure which i could build the website on, be it something like Wix or more Classic like an actual server where it needs to be hosted at.

And while we both spoke about what should be stated in the contract i stated that i need the access to his Web Infrastructure, and this nut job understood that i want access to his home WIFI.
He told me that he will write me everything on WhatsApp and at that time i was very sure i will get some sort of Remote Server Access or atleast some money to host something of my own.

But noup, he hits me with ""This is my Wifi Password"" 
and the following conversation ensues,

Me: ok , thats nice, but i still need the access to your server and or where you want me to host the 
website on.

Him: Yeha just host it on my WIFI, its got internet.

Me: Thats not how this works, i need a computer where i can host the website on, and that then be called a server

Him: Oh yhea just use my Computer then.

Me: You do know that than no one would be able to access your site when the Computer is off?

Him: Can't they just download my site onto their Computer and go onto it while my Computer is off?

Me: Thats not how this works....

Him: Well i payed you money, you just buy a computer from that and set it up here, and then we put the website onto it and i won't turn it off. 

Me: No, you payed me to build a website not to provide what is neccescary stuff to actually host a website, i assumed you knew what is needed to actually host a website.

Him: Yes ofcourse  i know what is neccescary, a computer and internet.
Thus my WIFI Password to you and i have a computer here.

Me: I will be returning the money to you by end of this week....

Him: What, why?
We signed a contract!
You can't just back out of it as you wish.

Me: Yes i can, and i will.

I try to explain to her that the phone is not the school's property, and I literally can't do that. I get yelled at for 5 minutes, and then the teacher tells me that I'm not doing my job and to call the real IT worker. I tell her that he took the day off today and its just me, and she tells me that I'm lying. She then takes me to the principal's office, like I'm still in high school, and she gets the principal to come out and tells him that I am being rude and not doing my job.

t3_d5rxjn,Our last consultant disappeared. Can you take over?,"I'm between jobs and picking up the occasional one or two day security project to keep busy. One day, a recruiter asks me to help them out with a problem that requires me to be on-site a few states away. Nothing about this gig was straightforward, but the rate was too good to ignore.  
  
Recruiter:""We placed a person there, they did a bunch of evaluation work, but then they went radio silent before explaining everything to the client""  
  
me:""And you want me to do what?""  
  
Recruiter:""Look over his work and present it to their CEO""  
  
me:""I'm not so sure. Flying out and back is some wear and tear""  
  
Recruiter:""They'll fly you""  
  
me:""I figured they'd take care of it""  
  
Recruiter:""No, they have a plane. They'll fly you""  
  
Now I'm intrigued. I agree. I get a dump of internal docs and a draft report with a bunch of notes. The client is a niche Software as a Service provider- their customers are large entities with a penchant for vintage or unsupported software that runs _everything_. Client's platform lets them still use them and work with less obsolete partners.  
  
Client's got a steady income stream, but doesn't want to spend any money they don't have to. Their infrastructure is mostly sane, but there's some things I want to call out
  
I prep a few slides to present the findings. A few days before the meeting, I'm told that John, the guy Recruiter previously placed has surfaced from hiding and will be coming out with me. We're also going to be presenting to Client's new security engineer who is coming in to meet us.
  
I fly out with Recruiter and John on a small jet to Client's city. We bullshit for a while, but John is a little wary of me.   
  
We land, grab a rental car and make our way to a hotel a rung up from the usual consultant storage unit. An hour later, I'm in the bar, seeking sustenance, reading a book, sketching out the high points I want to make. For an artifical environment such as a hotel bar, it's busier than I'd expect for a weekday.  
  
Pretty much everybody at this bar is a business traveler. Smiles and corporate speak are abundant. Some flirting happens over open laptops. It's fun to watch. For some people, this is a moment away from spouses and children. Perhaps what happens at the Marriott stays at the Marriott.  
  
Anyhow, I'm trying to list the things that bother me in Client's environment in case John doesn't convince the client or doesn't bring them up.   
  
I'm scribbling my notes when someone sits next to me. It's a woman in her mid to late 20s. I'm about to go back into my notes when I see what she's looking at.  
  
Two men who look like band members from a forgotten 80's hair metal band are in the bar, looking around. One is wearing a leather jacket and a few bright scarves. The other looks like an extra from Macklemore's Thift Shop video. Leather pants with odd buckles, a striped wool shirt and some kind of fake fur vest make up his ensemble. He's also wearing a top hat with goggles.   
  
I try not to stare, but somehow they seem familiar.  
  
I smile to the woman sitting next to me, subtly point to the Britny Fox tribute band and shrug my shoulders, then go back to my notes.  
  
I'm trying to order my issues with Client without coming across as negative. They're hosting in a colocation facility and claiming all the co-lo's audits as their own. That'll be a conversation with their salespeople. They're not patching stuff or scanning for vulnerabilities. I'll talk with the security engineer and see if they need suggestions.  
  
Maybe they need older systems to be compatible. Maybe we can work out some compromises.   
  
Over my drink, I notice that the two oddly dressed people have split up and are slowly working the room. They're approaching women, talking to them for a few minutes, then move on when it seems they didn't get what they wanted.  
  
Maybe they're selling time-shares.   
  
I see the Recruiter and John make their way into the bar. They make their way to a table and don't seem to notice me. I assume Recruiter wants to chastize John about becoming unavailable and discuss whose end my pay is coming out of.  
  
I hear a voice behind me and notice the woman next to me looking at its owner.  
  
Voice:""My buddy and I have a bet going. Do you believe in magic spells?""  
  
Woman:""Excuse me?""  
  
I'm curious to see what this is. I turn around to take a look and my jaw drops.

t3_d5orqa,"When you say 'Debian package', this isn't what it meant","Our customer has a proprietary software for their production that runs in a Linux virtual that I maintain. The software has always been really painful to upgrade, as they ship the updates by sending random bits and pieces of the software over e-mail, which at times don't interact right with the software as they've forgotten the new update also needs some other files. Also worth noticing is that the company making the software has 3 guys, the owner who's para-technical, some dude who knows a bit about stuff and then a total cowboy programmer who'd probably ship the software after each added line.

Snapshotting the virtual has saved the day numerous times, but the updates they send have since become an inside joke, as the company making the software often briefs the customer that 'it's just a quick update, won't take 5 minutes' and then it causes hours and hours of work for us when we go back and forth with the software provider about why it fails to start.

to minimize our pain, i've numerous times suggested that they should package the software. after some time and numerous larger than expected bills, the customer also agreed with us. 

they take their sweet time, telling us they've been having problems with Debian packages but eventually a .deb lands in my e-mail instead of the typical assortment of random script files.

I install it and make a note that it stays quite a long time in the post-install script, but after the install expected pieces are where they should be so I don't investigate further.

One day I receive another update and running dpkg -l with the package name I accidentally use dpkg -L, which instead of listing the installed package status and version lists the files inside the package.

My jaw hits the keyboard. The package has one file inside, a huge tar-file. I immediately extract the new version package I received and to my horror realize what they've done.

They tarred up the software, packaged the tar-file plus a post-install script that extracts the tar-file.

t3_d5lz01,Port Scan? I'm not running a stinking Port Scan.,"We have a group of technical non-IT folks where I work.  It would be a stretch to describe them as “engineers”, but that is how they describe themselves.  And so it goes. They do many things that overlap traditional IT duties, but they do it for customers and not internal users.  I have always considered their work kind of sloppy and shoot-from-the-hip kind of stuff but if I am being truthful, I am more than a little biased.

This group is a particular nuisance to IT (and the rest of the company at large) as they are not what you would describe as “rule followers” nor “team players.”  They like to run their own shadow IT and such.  While I try to reign this in whenever I can, the CEO is not willing to draw the line and enforce the company rules and regulations on this group for some reason.  I’m not sure if it is just conflict avoidance or chasing the almighty dollar, but there is something preventing him from cracking down on them and enforcing the company policies.  

So I have made it clear, as the head of IT for the company, that as long as it doesn’t interfere with the rest of the company they may do so but we will not support these shenanigans in any way, shape, or form.  Once it crosses that line, I will stop it with prejudice.

t3_d5jzq2,Just repeat after me,"I'm part of a small tech support company supporting all kinds of small to medium businesses. This one happens to be a dentist.

The usual manager is on pregnancy leave and is usually a filter for the simple issues. So with this filter gone we have the receptionist acting as an impromptu manager with next to no IT knowledge. She calls in literally anything. And usually it's their dental software which is a mess on it's own. They'd probably be better of calling their supplier since they want specific settings changed.
Anyways, today it was a word issue.

They're taking in some patients from another practice and need to download/import some dental imagery. The other dentist sent them in a word file for some reason and the impromptu manager couldn't save them as .png or .jpeg which was needed to import them in their software.

Files downloaded from the internet or email tend to open in read-only view to protect you from macro's so the receptionist only needed to enable editing to save the images as .png
To be fair I get why a regular computer user could run into this. So I showed the receptionist to press the enable editing button in the yellow warning banner at the top of word and showed how to save them. As a service I even imported the first images for her to follow it all the way through.

For the next patient I let her do the thing telling her to ""Just repeat what I just did"" which wasn't complicated at all. Open word file &gt; enable editing &gt; save image to a folder &gt; press import in dental software &gt; select the newly saved file.

She managed to get to the second step. She ignored the yellow warning banner and tried to save immediately.
So I told her ""remember to press enable editing"".
I see her mouse pointer drift around somewhat and she presses the cross **NEXT TO** the editing button closing the banner and tries to save again...

Her: ""Why isn't it working?!""

Me: ""Let's just start from the beginning and press editing button and not the X""

She reopens the file. I see the pointer drift around again for a bit before she goes up. Up to the one button to fix it all. 

And...

The games that the company designs doesn't use passwords as such to log in; instead, when you try to log in to the game using (email), it sends an OTP to your email address. Of course, tons of things can go wrong in the process, usually (but not always) at the customer's end.

Up to this point though, the ticket has been standard business -- person opens a ticket (not live chat, no phone calls, thank god) and says they lost their account. I run through basic security questions, they pass, I connect the account to (email 1), and send them steps for recovering it, and close the ticket. Job done, right? NOPE.

This is not about Ted, though. Sorry.

The first level help desk was pretty useless there, so I didn't have much info to begin with. My boss also ""warned"" me that the user was a ""special"" one. I asked why and he started laughing, ""You'll see"".

So I get to the user's office and once I locate him, it's clear that I'm dealing with one of the most socially awkward guys I've ever met.

Meanwhile, the guy is babbling non stop about how he asked his father for a new computer because this one is not up to his standards and is clearly malfunctioning, he knows that because he uses computers a lot, bla bla bla, this is going to take long to fix, bla bla bla. I had gotten used to this kind of behaviour, since quite a few men assumed that they knew more about fxing computers than I did... so I just ignored him, but I noticed a lot of his coworkers staring at us (we were in an open space with a lot of people coming and going).

Oh and yes, his father. I'll get back to this later.

I turned the computer off, turned the keyboard upside down and slammed it on the table. A cascade of paper clips and dirt landed on the desk. The guy went silent. I turned the computer on and voilà, Windows XP is loading successfully. The guy's coworkers started snickering, as I explained that a paper clip had gotten stuck on the F8 key and was keeping it down, thus triggering the safe mode menu. 

Yes, I could have been less theatrical, but the guy had it coming. A few minutes later, while I was getting a drink from the vending machine, one of that guy's coworkers explained that he had gotten the job because his father was the manager of the whole division, that he was completely useless but liked to brag non stop about how he knew better than anyone. I apparently did what everyone in that office had been dreaming of doing since Useless Guy had been hired!

t3_d597uq,An interesting tale of keyboards,"Hello, I am not IT; my father used to be. He was ""Director of Technology"" for a large school district. He quit his job a few years back because he was underpaid, overworked, and hated his job (They ended up splitting his job in two and each new employee got what he was getting paid). Since today is my cake day and I wanted to give some funny stories back to you guys, I asked him what were some of the stupidest things he saw when he worked there. This one really stands out.  


A little more background: My dad, let's call him $D, works at a small middle school, and although his job isn't tech support for the district, he still helps troubleshoot any problems at that school. This story happened around the early 2000's. That day he got a call from an older lady who worked in his building, lets call her $S, that her keyboard wasn't working.

$D walks down to $S's office.

$D: So what's the problem?

$S: My keyboard isn't working! It won't do anything!

$D: Let me have a look.

He presses a bunch of the keys, no luck. Unplugs and re-plugs it back in, no luck. Other basic trouble shooting stuff.

$D: Was this keyboard working yesterday?

$S: Yes, it was.

$D: Did you spill anything on it?

$S: No, I haven't spilled anything on it!

$D: Are you sure nothing has touched this keyboard since when you left and when you came back? It's very unusual for equipment to stop working overnight.

$S: All I did was bring it home with me and wash it! It was very dirty.

$D: You... washed it?

$S: Yes, It was getting really grimy between the keys, so I washed it in the dishwasher.

$D: ...Okay, I'll go grab you another keyboard, just... don't wash them in your dishwasher. It's not good for the keyboard.

$S: Oh really? I'm sorry, I didn't know that! Hopefully you can get this keyboard working again so I don't get charged for it ahaha *wink*.

$D: haha, yeah...

He threw it in the trash right after he gave her a new one

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR nice older lady's keyboard is gross so she puts it in the dishwasher and doesn't understand why it doesn't work.

&amp;#x200B;

t3_d52rgh,The VPN is dead! Long live the VPN!,"I work for a fortune 1000 company, at a pretty self-regulating research site in the middle of nowhere. We deal with a lot of bleeding edge tech, but also a lot of really old stuff that needs to be maintained. Our team is split about 3:1 on bleeding-edge research and old system research.

And when I say old I mean OLD. Ancient 10/100 Cisco core equipment, terminal servers, mainframes, old Linux and Windows distributions, and hundreds of other servers, services, and systems that are just not designed to be secure.

Most of the old systems can’t use modern high-security protocols, like SSH with multi-factor auth, so we have a set of VPNs that connect to each research ‘sector’ (basically area of research).

A call comes in. A user is getting an odd error message when trying to log in, but he accidentally closes it before he can read it to me. I can already feel this is going to take a while.

He’s trying to access a middle-ground sector. Basically, you connect to this, then it allows you to pivot to other sectors under the same umbrella. The initial connection is extremely locked down, with triple-factor auth and presence detection, so if you leave your PC, the connection is closed. 

(It’s what the client paid us for, so that’s what we implemented. And no, I neither know nor care who that client is.)

His logins are being rejected, but with technical errors, not failed authentication.

“Throwaway, why does this keep saying it can’t establish the session?”

“Maybe we’re at max users, Developer. Let me check the VPN server.”

He’s one of five people on, so there’s no way we’re at capacity. I check his auth attempts. All were successful, but the sessions he just tried to establish aren’t there.

He tries again, and gets a new error message. “Address not reachable”. He can get to the greater internet, but can’t resolve our VPN’s IP?

“Developer, where are you?”

“Upstairs.”

Now I’m truly baffled. He’s unable to reach a static IP from inside the building? That should not be a problem. 

I look at the firewalls, both ours and the clients. Our firewall is registering the traffic flowing, but on the client’s firewall, a TON of attempts were blocked from INSIDE the network. From the network we use for VPNs.

I start worrying that he’s accidentally pivoting through someone else’s computer, if they accidentally turned on a WiFi hotspot.

Sure enough, there it is. Traffic coming through a VPN IP. That IP can be tied to a VPN client, so I can see whose PC I need to check.

I looked at the username and decided my face and desk should be together.

“Uh, Developer? Can you do me a favor?”

“Sure.”

“Can you try to access {Client’s internal systems} directly?”

“Don’t I need the VPN for that?”

“Yep.”

Rewind: Remember these?

&gt;He’s one of five people on, so there’s no way we’re at capacity.

&gt;Our firewall is registering the traffic flowing, but on the client’s firewall, a TON of attempts were blocked from INSIDE the network. From the network we use for VPNs.

He was already VPNed in. He was trying to start his VPN while already having a VPN connection.

We now have an additional step for VPN diagnostics; make sure they aren’t already VPNed in.

TL;DR: user can’t VPN into the system because they are already VPNed into the system

The following exchange happened maybe a month after this (C is customer, M is myself), this is also after we've already been speaking for 5 minutes 

C: Well one of your guys was meant to be out here a month ago and no one showed up!

I scan his account and see no open tickets, call logs or service visits since signing up with us. 

M: Sir, I don't see an appointment booked for your account. Can you recall who you booked this with? 

C: Let me just read out your own f**king email seen as you're so incompetent...

Cue him aggressively clicking to find the email 

C: Please be aware that during the ours of 2am and 3am we will be conducting network maintenance which may cause poor performance and service outages

He pauses as if waiting for the A-HA moment. I'm pausing thinking he must be messing with me. 

C: See! So where the f**k was he?

M: Where was who? 

C: The technician! I stayed up till 4am and he never showed! I deserve compensation for that alone, my time is worth big money

M: Sir the email you just read out in no way references a technician coming by your property, it was referring to network maintenance as in us conducting maintenance on the entire network

C: IT SAYS BETWEEN 2AM AND 3AM

M: Yes that was the time frame we anticipated the work to be done 

C: I don't need you to explain it to me. I'm smart, I have a BA!

t3_d4tz8v,What’s in a name?,"Being part of a Sunday tech support team in my job with an ISP normally means things are laid back (unless someone decides we are running overflow for other departments or there is an outage).

This call involves my coworkers we will call them Monique and Jen for the purpose of this story.


Monique gets what seems like a normal call.  No internet connection.  She does the normal troubleshooting and advises the customer of her conclusion, that it is their equipment.  This the was customers answer to her:

To be fair, Brad would have been very nice about it.  He’s kind of your next door type of guy.  However given the facts even he would have said it was their equipment.

t3_d4noam,"""I'm absolutely positive it's because of your software!!""","This one was a while ago, but the persistence still astonishes me.

**The Cast:**  
$AL - Angry Lady  
$ME - Me  
$SW - Software in question  


So this lady had emailed our support box, she was having some periodic issues connecting to the internet, it'd work here and there but not all the time. Our company provides a few software products as well as general PC support based on the services your account has (aka. what you pay for). She'd been helped prior to emailing in and had been told at that time that $SW didn't cause the issue with her internet, but I think the first tech only went so far as having her do the work on the computer because we couldn't get connected. Since they only went that far, our superiors wanted do do more in-depth if we could.

I got assigned to create the ticket and reach out to her to do any additional troubleshooting we could to figure out the issue. I called her and the conversation went a little like this:

\[*insert normal pleasantries of beginning phone calls here*\]

$ME: So, we were just reaching out to see what other kinds of troubleshooting we can do to verify that $SW isn't causing the issue.

$AL: I'm certain it's $SW's fault! I didn't have this problem before I had $SW installed, and ever since then, I can't get on the internet sometimes.

$ME: Ok, well let's see if we can get connected to the computer with your permission and see what's going on.

*Her computer was being cooperative for a bit and allowing internet access so I was able to get remotely connected and take a look.*

$ME: So... from the looks of it, $SW has been installed since 6/10/19, and how long have you been having this issue?

$AL: It's been happening for the past two weeks! (*I called her sometime late July.*)

$ME: Ok, well, uhh, we can completely uninstall $SW, but I'll be honest here with you $AL, I don't think that it's causing or caused your issue. We installed $SW almost 2 months ago, and if its installation were to have caused you any problems, it would've almost certainly have provided you issues long before now. That isn't even including the fact that $SW doesn't really have anything that would cause you to have intermittent issues like this in the first place. 

\[*insert incredulity at the time gap, and questions about well if it's not you, what is it?!*\]

$ME: (*after doing a bit more looking*) I'm not exactly sure what the issue is since I can't quite see it while it's happening. I'd like for you to call back *while* the issue is present so we can do a bit more troubleshooting with multiple different methods of getting connected.

$AL: Ok, but I swear $SW is the reason this isn't working! Everything was ***just fine*** before I put this program on my computer.

$ME: ... again, $AL, you've had $SW on the computer long before your issues started. \~sigh Just give us a call at the time of the issue.

&amp;#x200B;

She called back and spoke with a different tech who, regardless trying any method, was unable to get connected. I'm thinking her Network Adapter or something was failing :shrug:  


TL;DR: Lady had an issue she was super insistent was because she installed $SW, despite her issue not being present until recently and $SW having been on the computer for months. Even after having this pointed out among other reasons this wouldn't be the case, continues to blame $SW many many times throughout a phone call.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d4g9or,"An extremely Smart, Knowledgeable, and Irritating User vs. a Compliant Linux Image","I work for a fortune 1000 company, in a middle-of-nowhere research office. We have very few employees, and very few ties to HQ. We basically do what we want, as long as we’re compliant and secure. 

Corporate has a standard Windows image, but it’s FAR to locked down for research purposes, and we have people working on tools for other platforms. In the past, we had Mac and Windows images, but I was hired to create a Linux image with the same feature parity; encrypted disks, no split-tunnels, locked down hardware, hardware tokens for network auth, locally-cached user credentials, etc. This will be important later.

Come Monday. We get a new hire, Keith. Keith is a hotshot, straight-from-college developer. He’s smart and he knows it. His ego fills whatever room he’s in. This is his first job ever, after graduating from [Very Prestigious University]. He is Very Smart.

So it comes time for him to get his new computer. He demands Linux. I shrug and grab him a Linux imaged laptop. 

He fake gags when he sees the Ubuntu startup screen. “Why not use a real OS like Arch?”

Oh boy. This ones going to be fun.

When I’ve finished walking him through setup, with him griping and complaining about everything from the window manager to user logins, I hand him back off to HR to go through orientation.

I turned to my coworker, and tell her “I give him three days to break it.”

Two days later;

I get a call from him, saying his system isn’t connecting to the Research VPN. Oddly, he doesn’t complain about his “crappy os” or how “bad it is”. I instantly guess what he’s done, but need to confirm it first.

I have him send me his error log, and immediately confirms my suspicions. “OpenVPN on Arch Linux blah”. 

He had reinstalled his OS. He was no longer on a compliant device.

“Where are you? I’ll need to do some manual intervention.”

Kieth: “Upstairs in the Developer room.”

I contact our Security Officer and we head over to Keith. Keith is then escorted to another room while his laptop is confiscated.

Oh by the way, he was working in a room full of people working on extraordinarily sensitive materiel for our company, on contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

And he had just brought a modified, unsecured device into the center of that room.

After an hour of copying his drive, then booting up the copy, then taking three seconds and one additional line of text to break in (single-user mode is a thing people), I could start looking at the damage.

And oh boy there was a lot of it.

The OpenVPN error was that a script was unable to run. However, he had removed said script, and commented it out in the config file. He couldn’t copy it because on the compliant systems, that script couldn’t be read by anyone but root. He couldn’t become root because he couldn’t sudo, he couldn’t enter single user due to boot menu protection, and he couldn’t access the disk because of a mix of hardware- and software-based encryption.

That script checked that a system was compliant, re-routed internet access through a proxy, prepped firewall rules to deny incoming connections, then connected through to the R&amp;D networks that user was allowed to access, based on what contracts they were on.

Before he reinstalled, the system was logging to our local servers. There were several minor security alerts where he had tried to sudo up to root, or somehow become root. We usually ignored them because 99% of people accidentally would type commands for their R&amp;D systems into the local console, not realizing. Any large, systematic incidents would be caught by the SIEM and reported.

Going through the hardware’s logs though, I saw that he had tried to root his Ubuntu image massively. He had wiped the BIOS, presumably to allow USB booting, then wiped the TPM. This prevented him from accessing the encrypted partition at all. After that, he had reinstalled.

However, the fact that he was even able to connect to the network on a non-compliant machine concerned us, since we had an 802.1x profile for the switch ports.

It turned out it was misconfigured, and was only checking MACs for several ports. So at least he helped us find that error.

After a very, very stern talking to, and a slap on the wrist, he was let back in, humbled and a lot more aware of not wiping his laptop. He was given a Windows machine, and we’ll see next Monday if the slap on the wrist worked, or he’ll need a boot out the door.

The funniest part is that these systems are supposed to be remote access to the R&amp;D network, where you can use whatever OS your heart desires as your remote-access workstation. If only he had known.

TL;DR: “I use Arch, btw” user complains about, then wipes his Ubuntu system. Compliance requirements then smack him in the face. User’s ego is deflated, and a tiny little security hole is found and patched. Yay.",talesfromtechsupport

I wish I could have gone further, I was trying to get Mr X to load the web page in a different browser by typing it out.

t3_d43vwo,User does not understand how time works,"This story takes place this past thursday.

As part of an annual sports event in the company I am currently interning in, me and another intern made a small website to track the run distance of our willing coworkers (aka basically everyone that is not in IT, shockingly enough). At the very top of the page,  there is a big warning that says the logging function will only be enabled during the night from thursday to friday.

9AM, I roll into work, cursing traffic jams in seven different languages simultaneously, and am immediately greeted by a dozen of messages from someone in marketing, that while not outright hostile, I can tell are seeping with anger. Before answering, I take a look at my mails and see a company-wide notice announcing the website to be live (predictably, it's not, and was never planned to be), followed by a chain of mails that is far too long to have been produced in the span of an hour (we open shop at 8). Guess who's the one who wrote the announcement in the first place.

I open up the IM client and just as I start typing my response, I get a call from the marketing guy. I shall be $Me, and he shall be $Marketing in the following conversation.

$Me: H'lo ?  
$Marketing: Why is the website not working ?  
$Me: It ain't supposed to be. Says so on the front page: ""You will only be able to log your data starting friday at midnight""  
$Marketing: It's thursday ! Why isn't it working yet ?  
$Me, *probably audibly confused*: Because friday comes after thursday ? (*Note: at this point the remainder of the open space is rolling on the floor laughing, and it takes every fiber of my being to not join them*)  
$Marketing: *You* said it would go live in the night between thursday and friday !  
$Me: I did.  
$Marketing: Why isn't it live then ?!  
$Me: It's not friday yet.  
&lt;Cue a few repeats of this with the marketing guy becoming increasingly angry&gt;  
$Me: The event starts tomorrow at midnight, there is literally no point in enabling data collection before it even starts, this'll just skew the dataset.  
$Marketing: That makes no sense ! Why would the company start an event on a saturday ?  
$Me, *internally*: `Segmentation fault (core dumped)`  
$Me, *externally*: ...You know that days start at midnight and end at 23:59:59, right ? (*cue the peanut gallery going wild again*)  
$Marketing: Forget it, I'll talk to &lt;head of IT&gt;. He'll help me, unlike some low level intern.  
$Me: Sure thing.

Rather unsurprisingly, my boss basically (and intentionally) repeated my words to $Marketing, until they apparently got through. 15 minutes after the end of their chat, a new company-wide announcement popped into our inboxes, proclaiming that due to a scheduling error, the website would only go fully live tomorrow.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_d3yr8l,"""Dialing phones for users is now IT's responsibility"" Pt. 2","Hi! I'm back!

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/d1y6cc/dialing_phones_for_users_is_now_its_responsibility/) for ease of access.

I'm providing more backstory of a ""normal"" work week so that you understand what is going on.

We're in the middle of an ongoing technology refresh among over a dozen buildings over 50+ acres (actually, I recently found out it's closer to 1900 endpoints).

Again, there's only two of us, and when someone has a helpdesk request, since we're either doing provisioning, network administration, or something else, most of the time they call for site security to sweep the halls of the buildings, and security physically escorts us to the user having the issue.

So, 10 to 20 times a day, I'll try to do a deployment, or work in a distribution frame, and I'll hear radio chatter behind me and a ""GOT 'IM!"" and sometimes be led, by the arm, to buildings a 10 minute walk away.

Such reasons for being ""escorted"" this week have been:

1. User forgot where the ""enter"" key was
2. User forgot password (written in front of them on a post-it note, I pointed it out then wagged my finger)
3. A pencil sharpener wasn't working (needed plugged in)
4. User didn't understand how to plug in a USB drive
5. User having issue with air conditioning unit. (after the 12 minute escort, Informed user I was IT, not facilities.)

In addition to this, we get scheduled to meetings both as ""standby"" and participant (sometimes double booked, as mentioned in previous posts). ""Standby"" is where we are summoned and requested to stay whenever there is technology involved (Video conferences, WebExes, Skype calls) because the managers ""need"" IT to be in the room with them in case something happens.

As such, the past 2 days, about 8 hours each day has been dedicated to being present in these meetings. This happens sometimes; it was an administratively meeting-heavy week. If we try to duck from these meetings, cue the security sweep and escort. Learned that one the hard way.

Director of our department ($D1 from previous story) has been asking for updates regarding the deployment of new units and a status report on how many old units remain across over a dozen+ building complex.

Our network itself is locked down by our governing body; I previously informed $D1 we have no access to sweep the network across this sprawling site (with my bit of infosec background, I tried things like nmap scans and nse scripts).

So here we go, into today's story.

$D1 calls me into their office and asks me to shut the door.

$D1: ""How many units were deployed the past two days?""

Me: ""We were scheduled as standby for \[Meeting1, Meeting2, Meeting3..\] both days.""

$D1: ""And where is the status report I asked for on the outstanding endpoints?""

Me: ""We have not been able to physically go around to all of the sites. We were scheduled for these meetings, and escorted for various helpdesk requests. I CC'd you on all of the tickets generated.""

$D1: ""$pukeforest, I get the feeling you are **deliberately disobeying** my requests.""

Me: ""As I mentioned, we are requested to be in multiple places at once. What you are asking for is physically impossible right now.""

$D1: *now yelling* ""I **EXPLICITLY** asked you to **COMPLETE THIS REPORT!!!**""

Me: ""How can I walk around the site, inventorying units while scheduled to standby in conference rooms AND deploying units AND being escorted around for non-IT issues?""

*$D1 stares at me with the intensity that I just insulted their family*

Me: *pleading* ""Can someone else please just be trusted to set up conferences and WebExes?""

$D1: ""**BUT. YOU. ARE. I.T.!!**""

Me: ""Could we get area managers to report back how many old units are in their locations? I'm just trying to offer solutions so that we can execute on schedule.""

$D1: *seething* ""Leave. My. Office. **NOW.**""

A few minutes later, get a call from HR, requesting I meet with them. On my way to HR, I hear another ""GOT HIM!"" and was, again, escorted by security to a user 3 buildings away.

Issue: A monitor was turned off. A simple power button press fixed it.

Finally, in HR's office, I am presented with a written warning for multiple accounts of ""insubordination"", along with a ""Day of Reflection"" (one day suspension without pay).

I refused to sign off.

I was told to see $D1 after reading my warning. So, I return to $D1's office.

$D1: ""$pukeforest, I think you understand why we had to do this. I don't like having to take disciplinary action.""

Me: ""actually, I don't understand at all.""

$D1: ""well, now you have an extra day to think about it. And I expect that report first thing on your return.""

Me: ""That's not possible. I have to be here physically to inventory the site.""

$D1: ""You are dismissed.""

I stood up, thanked $D1 for their time, and walked out.

I placed my keys, ID card, and fob on my desk, took all personal items with me.

I then left the site. I still had an hour left in the day. Didn't even clock out.

I've been really nervous posting all of this.

I just want this entire situation to go away, and to have a normal job in IT again. I just wanted to be an information security guy.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't return to homelessness.

It was such a long climb back.

I'm eyeing my assets and seeing how long I can hold it down.

&amp;#x200B;

But hey, at least I have a CISSP this time.

And several awesome members of this community have reached out to offer assistance. Friendship, guidance, job leads, you name it. That is infinitely more than I had before.

I have hope that this will all be alright in the end. That changes everything.

We'll get there.

I believe.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT/UPDATE

Oh man, this could not have been better timed.

Site-wide network outage prompts $D1 to call me the AM after.

&amp;#x200B;

$D1: ""we're experiencing a site-wide outage. I need you to come in and find the problem.""

Me: ""I'm currently suspended without pay per your orders.""

$D1: ""I understand, but you either come in or you're fired.""

Me: ""Okay..?""

$D1: ""So are you coming in?""

&amp;#x200B;

I took a long pause to think about how I worded this.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""No, I don't think I will. If you go into my office, you will notice all of my (company)-issued things are already on my desk.""

&amp;#x200B;

t3_d3xo0w,"The terrors of the IVR, or, What a nice lady!","This took place during my first week of L2 support for a major telecom, I was in mobile. For those of you who haven't had the pleasure, L2 is... not for the faint of heart. Majority of callers are pissed off, (sometimes rightly so) frustrated people who just want to get off the phone by this point. 

I had multiple people send me letters and treats as an L1 (security would let people send them in and pass them on, and no-one ever poisoned me, yay!). L2, not so much...

Step #1, do EVERYTHING L1 did over before further troubleshooting. Goes over like a turd in a punch bowl. Sadly, a lot of the time, it WAS something simple and this does do it, but it really brings on the hate.

So I'm almost halfway through my shift (1pm GMT-8) when my system populates an account that should **NOT** be on my system.

It's split into several records because of the sheer number of lines. The monthly charges are astronomical. It's a very recognizable world class corporation.

\*beep\*

me: *greeting*, *verification requests.*

In my head, red flags are flying, alarms are blaring. This kind of account should NEVER have been routed to me.

I immediately flag down someone to my desk to go figure out what the hell is going on and what to do. Meanwhile, I'm going through account verification, and I ask for a moment to read through the notes. There are a lot of notes. Reading them, it has all sorts of things on it that say ""DO NOT TOUCH THIS ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU ARE XXX"" (hint: I'm not XXX)

Word comes back to apologize for the missed transfer, and to very politely transfer her to where she belongs or offer a supervisor to assist.

She ***declines*** the transfer, says I will do just fine. (she's very polite)

Management says do what she says, she says jump this high, jump TWICE that. Handling time is irrelevant. **HANDLE WITH MAXIMUM COURTESY.**

Me: O.O'

I cannot remember this womans name, but she was a machine. A glorious machine.

4 hours. That's how long this call lasted.

We took our lunches together. I left my headset live and system still logged in, and she took hers at the same time then we continued.

New activations, deactivations, number swaps, notations for porting, feature additions and removals, plan changes, troubleshooting remote devices and devices she has in hand, testing network functionality at so many sites. EVERYTHING. Everything is also meticulously notated. 

I can't even tell you how many lines I serviced. She was a pleasure to speak to the whole time. Funny, kind and patient. I don't think I ever had to repeat myself giving directions on a single device. I think I might love her. By the end, we've chatted about just about everything under the sun while I'm performing whatever is needed on each line. And she's lovely the whole time.

So after trudging through this, we finally get down to the one thing I have no access to. The warranty systems. It's now about 4:52pm.

I connect to the warranty department and go through the whole list (notes and IMEI). I'm required to tell this guy pretty much everything he's going to be doing, so he NEVER has to ask questions of the customer. It takes a while. By about 5:02pm I've reached the end of my baton passing duties and I tell him I'm going to pass her through.

I switch back to LCL (lovely corporate lady). 

CS: Ok LCL, I've got xxx on the line with the warranty department, he's all clued in and you should be good to go. Is there anything else before I hand you over?

LCL: No CS, you've been great. Thanks for everything, I'll pass along a good note for you.

Now. As she is about halfway through that sentence, the world ended.

**THE WARRANTY LINE DISCONNECTS**

I'm staring at the system in shock, and I **KNOW** what has happened. And I, am completely screwed.

CS (in my head): HOLY SHIT! Uh.. Uh... \*frantic thinking\* I can play this off.

CS: Well LCL, I'm not quite sure what happened, but I'm afraid I've lost the line to the warranty department.

Now the **big** problem with this is there IS no direct line to warranty, you have to transfer through the IVR, and it shuts down automatically at 5pm, no bypass.

LCL: Excuse me? What happened?

CS: Well, I'm afraid I've lost connection to the warranty department and being after 5, I don't have a way to get you through until tomorrow when they reopen. I'm really sorry about this.

LCL goes **dead** silent.

LCL: ...

LCL: You don't need to make up excuses. I'm quite *intimately* familiar with those systems and I *know* what happened. 

CS: I'm sorry....

LCL: It's not your fault, you did fine. Notate the account for port out.

At this point I think my heart actually seized for a second. My eyes were probably about to pop out of my skull. I probably took a full 3 seconds to respond.

CS: I'm sorry?!

LCL: Just do it. I pay far to much to deal with this s\*\*t. I have nothing against you. Notate the account I will be porting out to XXX.

At this point I am losing my s\*\*t. You do NOT do this to this kind of account. Any kind of cancellation, port out request, MUST be handled through a different department by protocol. One where they will bend over backwards to do anything to keep you. It's ALL OVER the notations.

Don't get me wrong, I have the capability. But not the authorization.

I tell her I **need** to transfer her.

**She declines.**

LCL: Just notate the account please.

So I do so. Heart pounding like crazy, pretty sure I was shaking.

CS: It's done, again I'm really sorry.

LCL: Stop apologizing. You have a good night.

CS: You too LCL.

At this point I'm sweating, heart still pounding. Disconnected my set, logged off. It's about 5:30pm at this point. I couldn't even find anyone to tell about what was going to happen. I went home.

The next day I get to work and am immediately flagged by security at entry and pulled to the side.

A few minutes later, I'm greeted by the union rep, not a good sign. He explains to me that he will be there to back me up during the interview.

What interview? The one I had to give in front of a panel of executives and HR. I recognized a few of them from the pictures on the walls in the call center. Any guesses what it was about?

I was grilled for about half an hour about the contents of that call and what happened. Repeatedly. At the end of it all, after all the questions were done, the lead exec (LE) looks at me.

LE: So you are aware, the other party involved has already been terminated.... LCL clearly stated that there would be no chance at salvaging this if you were let go. You've got an angel on your side.

Then they sent me back to work.

A few days later, my system throws a security flag when I try to log on. I need to report to the security desk. I'm totally ready for them to take my badge and escort me out, it's over.

No. There is a delivery they just cleared, waiting for me.

t3_d3p4n4,Is there a mathematician in the building?,"Preface:

*I'm a developer, but I didn't get into it by the typical route. I had no interest in computers, other than to browse the internet on the magic box, as I was growing up. I studied maths at university, but to my surprise, in some of the courses I was introduced to the very rudiments of programming. I didn't like it much at first.*

*After graduating however, after failing a few attempts to be hired as a trainee accountant (for which I am eternally thankful) I got myself hired as a trainee software developer. I had a lot of catching up to do and still have a few gaps in my knowledge, but I believe I'm a pretty decent dev.*

*I currently work for a small digital agency where I do a mixture of new development, enhancements, supporting existing products, and really anything else. There's not much division of labour here.*

&amp;#x200B;

My desk phone rang. A somewhat unusual occurrence, and 99% of the time when it does it's our receptionist wanting to transfer a call from the front desk. I was somewhat surprised that the call was coming from one of our meeting rooms.

It was my project manager, $cheerful.

&gt;$cheerful: Hey, $cyborg\_ninja\_cat, can you pop over to $meetingRoom? We need your mathematical expertise.

Intrigued, I grabbed a pencil and the back of an envelope and toddled on over to where $cheerful and $workaholic, my lead dev, were poring over a laptop screen.

&gt;$workaholic: Hey $cyborg\_ninja\_cat! So if there's a price of £13 and we multiply it by 0.8 we get £10.40. And if we divide it by 1.2 instead we get £10.83.

These things are true. I scribble the figures down as I wait for the rest of the explanation, which is not forthcoming.

&gt;$cyborg\_ninja\_cat: ...yeah, those would give you different answers.

Light slowly dawns:

&gt;$cyborg\_ninja\_cat: ...so, you're trying to remove VAT?  
&gt;  
&gt;$cheerful: yes.

VAT, for the uninitiated, is essentially British sales tax. At the time of writing it stands at 20% for the majority of goods and services to which it is applicable. It's much more common to need to *add* VAT, and nearly everyone understands why you multiply the pre-VAT price by 1.2.

I think about it and scribble down a few more numbers, to check my intuition. Percentages can be tricky beasts.

&gt;$cyborg\_ninja\_cat: Dividing by 1.2 is correct. VAT is 20% of the pre-VAT price, and if you multiply by 0.8, you're taking off 20% of the *post-VAT* price, which is more.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently, a customer for whom we built an eCommerce website last year complained that certain VAT calculations were incorrect, and it turns out that it's our in-house platform that's getting it wrong and needs to be fixed ASAP.

I nearly died when I saw the resulting Slack conversation about it:

&gt;$cheerful: Yes, $cyborg\_ninja\_cat the mathematician really came into force there. Real team rally moment.  
&gt;  
&gt;$supporting\_cast\_1: Go team $cheerful!  
&gt;  
&gt;$supporting\_cast\_2: Thank god there's a mathematician in the building!

t3_d3of40,The wrong button,"My first tale on this sub.

I work onsite as a network admin/technical support/support for everything that has power for a rather small business with about 200 employees.

This story is in my top 5 and I wanted to share it with you.

&amp;#x200B;

A little background on this user. This user (of the female species) is the kind of user which blames browser slowness on her keyboard and mouse because they were replaced with new ones just prior to her browser issues.

&amp;#x200B;

And now the story. U = user, IT=me

&amp;#x200B;

It was early in the morning and I was remotely supervising one of our offsite PC where some other IT specialist from another firm was installing some software and I had to watch and enter the admin password whenever he needed.

U: Hello IT, my computer doesn't start.

IT: Alright, does it make any sound or are there any leds that light up when you try to start it up?

U: No, it's just dead.

IT: Does your monitor work? Does it's led light up?

U: Yes, the monitor just says ""No signal""

IT: Can you check if the power cable is connected on both ends?

U: Yes, it is.

\*\*\* I knew she didn't check because it was too fast and she is a very lazy and uncooperative person.

IT: Can you check again please?

U: Alright, \*puts the phone down and I hear some mumbled swearing as she probably ducks under the desk\*

U: It's plugged in on both ends. You should really clean your plugs, they are filthy and full of dust.

IT: \*I sigh\* That's not my job.

\*\*\*A few seconds pause as I read the IT specialists message asking for something.

U: So, what do we do now? Can't you just come here? (She was just a few minutes away on the other floor but I couldn't leave that guy alone on the computer).

IT: Sorry, I am engaged in a remote support session right now and can't come. If you can wait half an hour I can come to you then.

U: I have work to do (her voice raised a bit), can't wait that long. \*Yeah right, I say to myself as I know that she only works 1h every day and then watches videos or browses Facebook.\*

IT: Let's try something else. Try and use the power cable from your monitor to power the PC. If it's a bad cable, you can just come down and get another one.

U: \*Mumbled swearing\* Alright, hang on.

U: No, still nothing.

\*\*\*Now i just think it may be a faulty power supply or something else

IT: Ok, I need to look at your PC, I will come down in half an hour.

U: I told you I have work to do, can I bring it up to you?

IT: You can but I will not be looking at it for another half an hour, as I told you, I am engaged in another support session.

U: \*Grunts\*, Can't you just put that on hold? I really need to get \*bla bla bla some shit about a client\* done.

IT: Nope, I will come down in half an hour.

U: Ok! \*slams the phone\*.

&amp;#x200B;

Half an hour later I go down there with a power cable and a power supply.

IT: Hey, let me see what's wrong with it.

U: Finally! \*she backs of and starts talking to a colleague\*

IT: Pressing the power button. Computer starts up.

U: What? I swear I did the same thing, what have you done to it?

IT: Nothing, just pressed the power button.

IT: Here, let's just shut it down and you do it so we know everything is alright.

U: Alright. \*shuts down computer\*

&amp;#x200B;

She then reaches under the desk (the pc is rather in deep under it) and presses a button. Which button you ask? Well let me tell you.

The computer is a HP SFF 6300 and the power button is flushed (not recessed or risen) with the case and doesn't stand out as a power button.

But she wasn't pressing it, o no, her hand was higher up on the damn DVD Player button.

I was about to face palm but decided it was best not to.

U: See, it doesn't work!

IT: Do you know what button are you pressing?

U: Yes, the POWER button.

IT: No, that is the DVD burner button.

Laughter ensues in the room.

IT: Is this a new computer? I don't remember changing your station recently.

U: No, I had this for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

I said good day and left, no thanks, no nothing, she just set herself ashamed on the computer and started ""working"".

I do not understand this person. I checked and  she had the same pc for over 6 months and she just decided that day that the way to power on the PC is with the bloody DVD burner button.

Healthcare is a very interesting area of IT to work in and makes me question how some people managed to graduate from high school, let alone university. Good times. 

I was asked by HR to retrieve a color printer that was taken from another clinic location during a move. This specific printer was costing the company thousands of dollars just for toner and needed to be replaced with a basic black and white printer. Once I arrived onsite, the following transpired:

Me = Me

K = Karen (definitely a Karen)

Me: “Hi K. I was sent here to replace the large color printer and install this newer, more compact black and white printer.”

K: *gets very agitated* “WHAT!? WHY!?”

Me: “HR has requested that we swap printers out” 

K: *getting increasingly angrier* “But we need this! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS!? I’m going to talk with HR Director” *has HR Director’s phone number and starts tapping furiously*

Me: ..............

K: *lets out a shrill reeeee after texting* “I can’t believe she’s taking away our printer! How are we going to print out these decorations!? Our patients love these!”

Me: “alright new printer has been installed. Test page ca—“.

K: “WE DON’T EVEN GET AN ADULT PRINTER!? IT’s TOO SMALL!” 

Me: “This is the standard printer for our front desk staff”. 

K: “F-Fine! Whatever. I can’t believe you’re taking this away from us”. 

Me: “Have a nice day!” 

TLDR: HR asks me to get rid of a color printer a particular front desk staff member was “secretly” hoarding for arts and crafts, gets mad and texts HR director only to be told it’s gotta go. User gets pissed because now she can’t play with arts and crafts to decorate the front desk area.

t3_d3e5xu,There Is No Button,"I work for a B2B software company and occasionally I field support calls. Details have been obscured/changed to protect the innocent.

&amp;#x200B;

I had been working to troubleshoot an issue a $Client was having with our software. The issue had 2 parts:

&amp;#x200B;

It took me a couple of days of asking for examples, but eventually the $Client provided what I was asking for and I determined the first part was related to \~30 missing users. I added them to the system and alerted the $Client.

&amp;#x200B;

The second part involved the software trying to validate against the wrong set of accounts. After some investigation, I determined that the only way to change which set of accounts the software is validating against is a setting on the physical device at the client's location. This setting absolutely cannot be changed by us. I confirmed the issue against our system logs, then called the $Client to instruct them on how to correct the problem.

$Me: ""Hey $Client. So we found the issue. On your device, you'll need to hit the \[toggle\] button. From there...""

$Client: ""WHAT!?! NO! THERE IS NO \[TOGGLE\] BUTTON! Listen here $Me, we've been using this system for 2 years and this is the first time this has happened. We didn't do anything different than we have done for the last couple years. Clearly when you did this year's configuration recently you screwed something up and it's not working now.

There's no way we messed this up; this is on you.""

I can see where they originated from and which set of accounts they are attempting to validate against. I'm looking at this right now. I don't know what happened or who did what, but I do know what is in front of me. We need to get the software pointed at the right set of accounts. The \[toggle\] button should be right at the top of the main screen. If you can't find it, call \[the hardware vendor\]. Your company gets priority support so make sure to take advantage of it.""

t3_d3368b,A Computer Was Stolen!!,"This is going to be a pretty short story but one me and my co-workers died laughing over. For some background, I am a undergrad student working as a general IT guy (I do everything from help desk to setting up switches and servers). When I was hired, I mainly did support at company HQ,over the past few months I started to support some of the smaller satellite offices.

Cut to last week when I was in remote office with a to do list of general maintenance items. One of those items was to move a workstation employees would use to remote into out of the cubicle area over to a copy room to make room for a new hire. I worked closely with a department head on this to make sure they knew where this computer was going to be moved to, so on and so forth.

The NEXT day, I am back at company HQ and all of IT is getting emails that a workstation was stolen from right under our noses. Copied on these emails was of course a distribution group that included everyone in the remote office. Needless to say there was panic and crazed people trying to figure if anything else was stolen. It didn't take long for us to find out this all started when the department head started emailing people saying the remote workstation (you know the one) had been stolen. In the span of 12 hours this absolute genius of an engineer had completely forgotten that HE wanted me to move the remote workstation. Needless to say it took hours for people to finally get it in their heads that there was no robbery.",talesfromtechsupport

&gt;$tm: I'm not stupid it's definitely plugged in. I've tried a different plug and everything. 

&gt;$me: Ok well the software isn't recognising the headset and neither is the playback device area. Has the headset ever worked?

&gt;$tm: Yes it works fine it's just intermittent. It's a brand new headset.

&gt;$me: Ok well because it isn't working we'll send a tech on over to take a look.

So, I had to ask a tech to go on-site to check her headset out which I hate to do because it's normally a simple plug in. Lo and behold, the USB cable is not plugged in. The user then tells the tech that they 'most definitely had it plugged in'. 

I know this story isn't particularly interesting but why the feck are people lying? We're trying to help them fix crap and they make it harder by bullshitting.

t3_d30jyp,There's a Ghost in My Computer!,"This happened about 15 years ago when I first started working, but was reminded of the story when I went to my former manager's retirement lunch this week. 

When I first started working I was a junior on-site IT analyst at regional sales office for a medical supplies company.  We had a mix of marketing, sales, and field support in the office.  There was a guy who was in field support who looked very close to Doc from Back to the future and was always tinkering away in the lab, but he also had an office with a desk, PC, and phone in it.  

I come in one morning and check the voicemails on our tech line and he left a voicemail stating that he would like a new computer put into the lab.  I asked my manager and he asked me to find out why he needed a computer in the lab and in his office and to ask if we could replace his PC in his office with a laptop and docking station.  So I walked down to the lab and there he was tinkering away with parts for medical devices.  I approached him and told him I was here to follow up on his request for a secondary computer and asked him some questions.  

He turns around and shuts the door to the lab and invites me to sit down.  And proceeds to tell me the he believes there is a ghost in his computer in his office because it randomly shuts down while he's working on it.  I start to interject and tell him that I think it might be a bad fan because we just fixed a few of those and it was the same model he had.  

He held his hand up and said, no it's not bad fan.  He went on to explain that he believed his dead wife was haunting him through his computer because he had an indiscretion on a business trip that she found out about.  Before they could sort  through their issues she had a stroke and died.  

I was 22 and only had about 5 months of work experience at that point, so I just didn't know what to say, so I said I was sorry about his wife and left.  

I went back to our IT area and told my manager and my 2 colleagues what I was told.  They thought I was joking, or that he was playing a joke on me since I was new.  My manager and my colleague who was senior in the group went down later in the day to talk to him and he told them the exact same story.  When they went to collect his PC so they could look at it he refused to let us take it because he thought the PC needed to have some sort of exorcism or intervention.  They really didn't know how to respond.  

That weekend we had to be in the office anyway for a network upgrade so we took a look at his computer and sure enough it was a bad fan.  We replaced it and put it back and decided not to say anything to him and just see what happens.  

A few days later he sees me walking by his lab and calls me in, he then tells me over the weekend he went to see some sort of psychic or something and she helped him talk to his wife so she wouldn't haunt him anymore.  And he knows it worked because his computer no longer turned off on him when he was trying to type up his field visit reports.  

I didn't want to burst his bubble, so I told him I was glad and reported back to my manager.",talesfromtechsupport

$CL: My boss sent me here to get some stuff, and he says I need to pick up a 20 Jigabag UBS dingle . 


Now, I'm used to hearing ""I need a UBS drive/stick, but this was a new one. Never before had I heard someone refer to storage as a Jigabag, and certainly never heard it called a dingle. 

$me: do you mean like a thumb drive to store documents on? 

$CL thumb drive, dingle whatever I need one that's exactly 20 jigabags

$me: well, they only come in 16, 32 and 64 **GIGABYTES**

$CL: no, you're wrong. My friend got one from here that was 20 Jigabags

$me(internally): oh dear God, it's going to be one of those customers. Please just storm of thinking you're right

$me: well unfortunately they don't make ones like that; however, I can still help you find a relatively cheap drive that's large  enough for you, we actually have some 32 Gb ones on sale right now. 

$CL: THIS IS RIDICULOUS. YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO SELL ME SOMETHINF THAT'S MORE THAN I NEED. I have a 20 jigabag file and I need it for a presentation and I need it NOW. If you can't help me I'll just go to $GoodPurchase, at least they know customer service.

$me(internally): fine, just please get out of my sight.

$me: if that's what you think is best then please feel free to.


CL the proceeded to storm off from the tech desk, leaving in a huff making sure let her displeasure be known as her car screeched out of the parking lot. The kicker? 2 days later she came in again (without recognizing me) saying she can't transfer a large folder to her new 'UBS dingle' I told her that I'd take a Look. The USB is fat32 and her folder full of photos is almost 20Gb. Now normally if I need to reformat a blank drive for someone, I'll do it without charging because it's relatively quick and I can do it on their own device. But as I explained to her what I was going to do, I was all to eager to look at the price chart and see it would be a $25 charge. She agreed and paid and I reformatted the drive to NTFS.

t3_d2qxy9,"'Your tech broke my PC, I want to be reimbursed for a new one!""","Reading the title, it seems like a reasonable request, right? 

I work at a company that provides and supports field technicians for one of, if not the largest ISP in Belgium. My job is at the Servicedesk, or IT support. I don't assist the client directly, but instead company employees and field techs. It's usually stuff like 'You forgot to activate your VPN' or 'You cant use Chrome for \[platform\], use IE' yada yada. Pretty simple stuff.

Anyway, one of the planners (the people that plan in the techs to specific jobs) came to our 2-man desk and asked 'Can I borrow you guys your expertise?'. Thats... A odd way of putting it. 

Me: A flying fucking meatball  
P: Planner

P: 'So, one of our techs accidently unplugged the power supply to the pc/server of one of the clients, and said client claims that the PC is now completely broken and unusable. What I need to know, is that possible, and is his replacement computer a reasonable one?'  
*P hands me the invoice for the original pc.*  
Me: Hm. Looks like a  Gigabyte Brix (think Intel NUC, tiny little cube that can do office work) with a SSD in it... I dont think it can actually break, atleast not a computer this recent (2015). Data corruption, sure, Windows not working, perhaps. But full-bore hardware failure? I highly doubt it.   
P: See? Thats what I was thinking. But he claims a total hardware defect. Here, this the new PC he bought. Is this a adequate replacement?

Now, the Brix he had was a simple one. Dual Core I3, 250Gb mSATA, 8gb DDR3 (iirc). Not powerfull, but I'm sure it did its work. The invoice was...

Me: The hell? Is he serrious?  
P: Yep, no doubt. Why?  
Me: Intel i5 8600K? GTX 1050Ti? 16Gb DDR4 Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO? 1Tb Samsung 980 SSD? A fucking Sharkoon TG5 RGB case? ROG STRIX Z370-F? This PC is easily worth twice, if not three times the initial one! Hell, this thing is almost the same as my own gaming rig at home, and that thing can run Crysis!(Planner is a gamer, but doesnt know much about hardware, so he gets my joke). No, this is ridiculous.   
P: So.... He's bullshiting us?    
Me:  Let me put it this way. Our tech bumped his 10-year old Lada, he claims it no longer runs, and he bought a brand-new BMW to replace it.    
P: Deny claim?  
Me: Deny claim. I'd be happy to write a 'letter of expertise' if you want

&amp;#x200B;

So, the planner is off to tell the client to fuck off. Hopefully, that letter wont be needed, but we'll see if the client wants to combat the denial. Funny thing is, if he just went and bought a new Brix, he would've gotten reimbursed, no question. Its because that the planner noticed that the hardware is different that they took it into doubt.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d2tsr7,"""I dont need no f**king help desk ticket!!!""","*Backstory:* I work for a growing company in the mid-west. I was hired a year and half ago for some IT consulting, and have taken on a part time position as the ""IT Manager"" or ""Network Administrator"" ...or doer of all things IT - while I finish my undergrad program at school. I'm not the first person to do IT work for this company, but I am the first on-site staffed IT person to play contribute to daily operations. By and large, I have been received really well by other employees. They might not understand what I do all day long, but they understand why I am there. Because the company I work for is growing pretty quickly (and because this is a new position outright), it has been an on/off struggle to keep everyone's requests satisfied quickly. Three months into the job, I implemented a ticketing system to better organize my work, and separate help requests from other matters. I even put a little icon on everyone's desktop through a GPO so people could just click on it and submit a ticket. When everyone plays by the rules, this system works wonders. 

Remember how I said I've been well received at the company? Well, there are about 2-3 people (out of \~400) that absolutely refuse to acknowledge why I am there and what I do is... well...an actual real job. They all work in a separate department from me and I seldom have to deal with any of them (thankfully). This one particular incident involve one of them (who is a Project Manager for his department), me, and a new computer. 

*$PM= Project Manager - Me=me* 

As many of you are aware, all Win7 computers are loosing their support from Microsoft in January of next year. My boss asked me to get going on that earlier this year and so I have been assessing, updated or replacing all Win7 machines in the company since January of this year. Well, I finally made it down the list to this $PM. I had emailed him a week in advance stating that his machine was due for an upgrade to Windows10 (and why it had to happen), then we had scheduled a date to do. I told him to back up his data to the server, and to make sure nothing mission critical would be on it at this time. In my mind, I thought sweet, maybe he had finally crossed over the dark side was going to let me do my work. 

I get to his desk on the scheduled date and time, and he moves out of the way and lets me upgrade his machine to Windows 10. I even had an extra 4G stick of ram I threw in it to boost its performance. All was going smoothly until he said to me-

*$PM: I really don't know why Im being upgraded. Shouldn't I just get a new machine and we pass this one down?""*

*Me: Well, your machine isn't quite old enough to warrant replacing it just yet. You've got at least another year or two of life in this thing.* 

*$PM: Weeeelllll. Thats some bullsh\*t. I want a new machine!*

*Me: Sorry man, I'm just doing what I'm authorized to do. I can only make approved purchas-*

*$PM: I'm getting a new machine whether your authorized or not!*

Everything that happened prior to this was going so smoothly, I almost shed a tear in joy. But no, it had to derail at the last moment. The next day, I found out he went behind my back to my boss's boss and threw a temper tantrum. My boss came up to me and said to just buy him a new machine and pass his current one down (as if this has happened before in the past). I said Alright and got a new one on the way. It usually takes a couple days for it arrive at the office, and then about half a day to get the machine all set up and configured for who its going to. 

I emailed the $PM again, we set up another time to get it all set up on his desk with a new docking station and everything. Again, I get there at the scheduled time with the new machine and equipment-

*$PM: Uhh yeah. This isn't a good time actually. Just leave the machine here and I'll just wait for you next week.* 

*Me: Okay. (thinking this is going to blow up in my face again).* 

I get home a little early that day only to have 6 emails in my inbox. The first one was ""Hey I switched over my machine to the new one"" proceeded by how do I do, log in to, or what do I do with XYZ for 5 additional emails. So, taking a deep breath, I took a screenshot of all the emails he had sent me, answered all of his questions and then stated that he should use the helpdesk if he has any issues (with a pic of all of the emails he had sent me). Im alerted if there is a ticket so you will be helped either way. *No response.* 

It's now labor day weekend, so naturally I took Monday off and Tuesday marks the first day back to class. (I have my classes scheduled so that they are only on Tuesday and Thursdays, and then I work every Monday Wednesday and Friday.) The week prior I had sent a company wide email reminding people to use the help desk for their issues instead of contacting me directly for support. 

Tuesday morning-  
Text from $PM: *You updated my PDF software and It's not what im used to. Can we roll back to an older version.*

My response: *Most likely, put in a ticket to the helpdesk and we can look at it tomorrow together.* 

Phone call 3 minutes later-

Me: *Hello, this is $Me-*

$PM yelling extremely loudly: *I DONT NEED TO PUT A TICKET INTO THE F\*\*KING HELP DESK. YOU JUST NEED TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO. HOW DO I GET THE NEW VERSION OFF AND THE OLD VERSION ON. WHY DO I HAVE TO PUT IN A FREAKING TICKET, YOU ARE MAKING THINGS DIFFICULT.* 

I blew a gasket. *Me: This is ridiculous $PM. I gave you every opportunity to do this the right way. I literally handed you the tools to make sure everything went as smoothly as possible. This is my first day back to class, and here you are contacting me on my day scheduled off.* 

I then continued to tell him how to do it and he finally got quiet and listened. Soon though, he got very defensive, telling me how the UI in the new PDF software is just all wrong and how and why he can't get used to it. When this happened, I pretty much just hung up on him.

...

A few years ago I was involved in running a small conference. The team had selected a keynote speaker, a very distinguished and elderly academic.

He turned up with his presentation on an iPad, which was locked. I asked what the password was and he said ""I don't know, it's my son's iPad"". 

I asked if he had another copy he said ""No. But you shouldn't need to have the password anyway. Surely you just plug it in and it appears? Right?""

And that is how our conference ended up with an elderly academic trying to verbaly describe some slides he wrote a few days earlier to a room full of delegates.

Pro-tip: Always get your speakers to send their slides ahead of the conference.

t3_d2jqvf,Escalation without warning.,"I work for a $21B company.  Despite our size, we have a good amount of technical debt.  Unfortunately we also have people like Karen...she was a Director but is now a VP.  Karen has a reputation for being a jerk.

We use Office 365.  For those unaware there is a hard limit to the number of email addresses you can white list. (We don't like to white list an entire domain to prevent spam or phishing in case the sender domains compromised).

We reached the hard limit of 1024 email addresses in the white list.  In speaking with Microsoft, we learned you can have a user white list within Outlook and it doesn't count against the 1024 limit.

OK, so yesterday I get a ticket to the server team to help her because an email she needs was quarantined.  I had previously written documentation for users to release their own messages and to white list the sender to prevent future issues.  I emailed Karen the document and never heard back from her.  Skip to this morning and I see an email from Karen letting me know just how crappy my document was, she said neither she now the local IT people could follow it.  Rather than tell me this and ask for help or provide feedback, she went to my Director and escalated to her telling her I provided poor documentation.

I advised her that I know the instructions are good because I had my team test them out and have had some users test it too.  The only person that had complained started at step 2 instead of step 1.  I offered to walk her through it.  That was when she told me the local IT person released her message for her from quarantine.  But that doesn't white list the address and because we are at the limit if you do try to white list it you get an error.

So step 1 of the document was to login to OWA which sets up the person's credentials to O365.  Step two is to open the quarantine page which will use those same credentials.  Both steps have clearly underlined hyperlinks to follow.

After some digging I found out that she had printed the document and taken it to local IT.  Well naturally they could not follow it because there are no links to click in a printed document.  

I let her know specifically what the techs could not follow the directions, told her I provided them an electronic copy and verified they all understood it.

Shortly after this my Director sent her an email that politely thanked her for bringing this to her attention and that she would make sure the help desk people know what to do going forward.

As an FYI, I would normally Skype or call someone rather than just send an email, but this particular issue had already been documented and was supposed to be resolved on first call from the help desk and should never make it to the server team since it is handled on the client side now.  

Happy to say my Director had my back and I am grateful she had a more eloquent way of sending Karen away.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d293ri,That Which Must Not Be Said,"The following occurred many moons ago when I was a student employee working the Tier 1 Help Desk providing Tech Support to employees and faculty of a university.

&amp;#x200B;

The Cast:

$ME: your fearless narrator, relatively new to the tech-support game

$HC: hopeful co-worker, a bit naive in his observances of the unspoken rules of tech-support, but more advanced in work experience

$NE: father of $HC and Network Architect at the University

$OC: Other co-worker, working the afternoon shift. Also more advanced in the work experience than I.

The Setup:

It was summertime in the Key City and though school was out, the work of learning never stops. $ME and $HC were holding court in the fishbowl answering the occasional phone call. Most of the issues were easily managed with a password reset here or a system reboot there. All in all it was a good day with plenty of time to work on my goal of reading the internet. Mid-day was approaching and the question of food was coming up when the following interaction happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

$HC: I'm going to leave a bit early for lunch so I can meet my dad for lunch. It's slow so you'll be okay.

$ME: (pauses at the dropping of the fateful ""S"" word) Okay. Enjoy your lunch.

$HC leaves the building ~~and is never heard from again~~ 

A few minutes pass and I find that I am unable to read the internet. I reboot my machine and go through some standard troubleshooting procedures to try and address the problem but to no avail. Then my phone rings.

$ME: ""Thank you for calling the HelpDesk, this is $ME, how can I help you today?""

$NE: (skips the pleasantries and cuts straight to the chase) ""Can you get on the internet?""

$ME: No

$NE: ""That's what I thought."" &lt;Click&gt;

$ME: (Thinking to myself) That was ominous

By this time $OC had arrived and since the entire campus was on their lunch hour ~~and a half~~ the phones had not started ringing yet. At this point, I held out hope that the issue would be resolved before the end of lunch. I was to be disappointed in that hope. Word came down from Networking that there was an issue with our campus-wide connection to the internet through our ISP, a major multi-national company. Basically, our connection was broken and no traffic was going through. 

I repeated the following conversation dozens of times in the x hours it took to fix the issue.

""Thank you for calling the HelpDesk, this is $me, how can I help you?"" 

\--some version of-- ""I can't get on the internet!!!""

""We are currently experiencing problems with our network and are working to resolve them asap. No, I do not have an ETA yet on when the issue will be resolved.""

t3_d2fli7,The oblivious client and vendor,"So this happened recently.

I work at a national MSP in Pro Services, so 90% of my work is project-related. I work closely with a network engineer, whereas I'm the server/virtualization guy. 

We got wind from the NOC of a repeat client of ours with three branches, and whose mid-size branch seemingly lost external internet connectivity  overnight. My partner and I cannot help ourselves and began looking into it.

It took a little while, but eventually we noticed that the branch ASA's default gateway was an appliance we do not manage. I contact the client and tell them they need to get that other vendor involved ASAP to check that hardware.

I'm cc'd on the outgoing message, in which the client asks: ""Could this be due to blocking port 53?""

WHAT.

An email conversation ensued, and the vendor reverses the block. Boom, internet. 

The vendor replies with, ""We apologize; our engineers told us this would not be service-impacting.""

HEAD DESK.

Apparently, because they were using Google DNS forwarders, that was flagged by an auditor, and not knowing exactly what to do, they asked the vendor to just block all port 53. What's even more amazing is the vendor did it without question.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d3cbo7,The power supplies aren't plugged in,"This happened a few years ago, I worked for a company that had a business that was selling and reselling electronic equipment.

We took our business online and had a very simple setup. We had a large server with the main website running.

We would sell equipment and get calls from customers asking if their equipment was there. When we told them we would need to be connected via USB for them to be able to see what they were getting, they had none.

One day we went out to a customer and explained that everything was connected via USB.

We received a call after the sale and asked if the equipment was plugged in. ""Yes, but I've never plugged it in""

""Well, I can't just plug it in, I've checked it and everything looks good."" ""Okay, give it a minute and I'll be back.""

We took a phone call back and she plugs in the USB. The phone rang after the initial bootup and we took a look inside. The USB and power cable are plugged into the motherboard, not the power supply. She plugs it in and it boots up fine.

""And that's when I noticed something weird"". The motherboard is not plugged into the power supply.

""Okay, I'll be right back.""

After a few minutes, we get a call.

""Oh no, we could not see anything.""

""Okay, I'll be right back.""

""Well, you don't plug it in.""

""I'll be right back."" (In front of hundreds of people) ""Okay, I'll be right back."" ""Thank you, I'm off.""

t3_d1y6cc,"""Dialing phones for users is now IT's responsibility""","Happened today. I am still in disbelief. 
There might be typos, I'm still calming down.

Backstory: I am one of only two IT personnel at a dozen+ building facility with over 1,000 endpoints. Naturally, they smash every IT position into one role. 

We issue multi-factor authentication devices to management and some senior staff so they can do their work offsite. Once the handoff of the device is complete, our responsibility ends, and user has a packet with all the data to get them up and going. A separate, remote team for MFA exists exclusively for support of these devices. This has been protocol for years.

Clock in and find nasty email from Director #1 ($D1) sitting in my inbox this morning about how ""unacceptable"" and ""unbelievable"" that one of their staff could not log in from home this weekend due to $user's MFA device not ""functioning correctly for months"" (first we've heard of the issue).

Director has been in their position 10+ years.

My response (cc'd to all directors): ""All support for these devices is handled by the MFA team as stated when the devices are issued. We have neither the tools nor ability to help in this matter. In the future, please have the user contact MFA team at ### as explicitly stated in the documentation.""

30 minutes later, I am called into $D1's office. $D1 and two other directors ($D2, $D3) start arguing with me why I didn't solve the issue.

Me: ""All support for these devices is handled by the external MFA team. $user can call the number provided for support. As I said, we do not have the tools to do this.""

$D2: *voice raising* ""why won't you help $user? aren't you IT? Can't you solve simple problems?""

Me: ""... All. Support. For. These. Devices. Is. Handled. By. The --""

$D3: *screaming* ""WOULD YOU JUST DO YOUR JOB??""

$D1: ""That's exactly my point! $pukeforest isn't helping $user with this! I'm going to issue a Corrective Action Plan and I WILL report this incident to HR.""

Me: *staring* ""what.. what is it exactly you need me to do?!""

Picture three directors, cursing and pointing at me for nearly 10 minutes. I'm talking walls are vibrating with their screams. Other directors in the hall close their doors as I am getting verbally clobbered. I stare through the wall. My anxiety is through the roof.

Insult after insult about work performance, how this is typical of how shoddy we are as IT professionals.

Finally, $user in question comes to the door.

$D1: ""DO YOUR DAMN JOB and get $user set up!""

I'm visibly shaking at this point. Stunned.

Breathing heavily, I manage to walk over to $D1's desk phone. On speakerphone, I proceed to dial the off-site MFA team's number. 

A voice comes on the line.

""$MFAguy, can I help you?""
I motion to $user to introduce themselves and speak their issue.

About 90 seconds later, $user can log in. Tested. Works perfectly.
Everyone is silent and staring at me.

I shake my head disgustedly and leave.

$D1, $D2, and $D3 have avoided eye contact with me all day.

Thank you to everyone for their support and for those that read my sub-stories of hanging on to this job for dear life + credentialing up in infosec during my ""homeless adventure"" (the real reason I didn't ragequit yesterday, not eager to return to that).

t3_d24z7w,The woes of bureaucracy,"Sometimes, being a small cog in a large machine can be frustrating. Large company, lots of contractors, lots of outsourcing.

I work in our service desk. When something goes wrong, they call us. I sometimes dream of the Active Directory environment being directly managed by us, but that's not the case. Onboarding and offboarding is similarly out of our hands, it should all just work automatically.

A few days ago, we get a weird issue where old users that should be properly offboarded have not been. They're still ghosting around in our systems. We have a list of users that are affected, and now we want to find out if they're disabled or not, and what their account expiry date was. Simple, right? Whipped up a quick script to export that data from AD, run it, kick back and relax-..

It doesn't run. Server doesn't have the right settings. Easy, I just have to contact the people in charge of our server!

They can't change the setting.

Can't or won't? Who knows?! No one. No one knows. Okay fine, we'll just ask our vendor who provides our AD services to do the export. We'll even provide the script! Easy!

No results. They can't or won't help. We need this data, yet our vendor is so awful they won't help.

That's the story of how I ended up searching for 125 users, one by one, in two different AD environments, to manually write down their expiry dates and their enabled/disabled status.

In a previous post I mentioned that we are currently overstaffed at my call center. This results in long waits between calls. About half an hour before closing I was second in line for the next call. I figured that this would work nicely. I expected to get a call after about 10 minutes. Then spend about ten minutes in the call and then just wait out the last 10 minutes.

Then the clock just kept ticking without a single phone call. Eventually the guy who was in front of me got a call. But at that point it was less than 15 minutes left. There was still a chance I could get a call that I could solve without me working overtime. But with every passing minute it got riskier. We got to 10 minutes left. Then 5 minutes left. Still no phone call. I was getting nervous. 

Then it happened. The queue crashed. Causing all agents to be kicked off the queue. By the time I had logged back in to the system I was so far back there was no way I would get a call in the remaining 3 minutes.

FL: Hi, I have been trying to connect to the internet and I cant get on.  Is there some problem you guys are having?

Me:  Sorry to hear that Ma'am, I'll help you out the best that I can.  If you can please hold on while i check the system?

After reviewing the system screens, I see that there are no issues with the servers or the modem bank.  Ask CW to check and confirms there is no issues on our side.

Me: Sorry for the wait Ma'am, I just checked the systems and had the administrator check as well and we don't see any issues.  Can i please have your account number and I'll check on your account status.

FL: Its 55555555.  Can you please hurry this up?  I need to check my emails.....

Me: Ma'am dial-up service works through your phone line, you can only use one function at a time.  If you are on your phone then you cant use the internet, vise-versa you cant use the phone while on the internet.  Could you please do me a favor and hang up and try again.  

FL: NO!  YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO GET ME OFF THE PHONE SO YOU DONT HAVE TO FIX IT!!!!

Me: No Ma'am, I'll be here for the next few hours and will be taking calls.  I need you to do this so i can test your connection.  I assure you I'll answer if you try again and cant get on.

The people that use it during the summer got used to it not being THAT bad. But this being the beginning of school, every teacher is still staying on top of their attendance during advisory hours. This means that not everyone can actually sign in at once, and 20+ people attempting to sign in boots people off. I get it, it's frustrating. But this happens every year at this time.

t3_d1z2ny,"""We have a firewall""","So this is a story I've been hanging onto for a while and revolves around a previous place of employment. Sooo, here goes.

**Backstory:** So I worked at a place that once a year there was an inspection by multiple state and local agencies due to HIPPA and all that good jazz. Each year these agencies would send someone out to inspect different aspects of the operation. One of which was protection of HIPPA data stored on-prem. The head of the place would have the Director of IT show the people around and talk about what we were doing. Of course this particular Director of IT knew just enough jargon to pretend to be knowledgeable.

**Cast: $Me = Me, $ITDir = IT Director, $SA = State Auditor**

This one particular day our $ITDir shows up and lets us know in about a hour we will have visitor to check out our security we are using to secure the data and our network. Auditor shows up and it goes a little like this.

&gt;$SA - So, tell me about what you are using to secure the data on the network  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$ITDir - We have a firewall  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$SA - A firewall? Anything else you are doing to secure the data? Encryption on the server, Bitlocker on end devices, access logging?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$ITDir - Yes, we have a firewall and it encrypts data and Endpoint  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$SA - But that's only from the inbound/outbound data if you're using a VPN. What about internally?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$ITDir - Umm, I think so on the server but I would have to ask our network guy. Hey,   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me do we use encryption on the servers or endpoints  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me - No..$SA - You should be encrypting your data on the network and end devices to protect the client data.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$ITDir - Hey $Me why aren't we using it.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me - Well because since I've been here in the last several years and asked to implement it I've been told by you and the DBA we don't need it.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$ITDir - $SA we are going to look into this and see what needs to be done. But in the meantime we have a firewall to secure our network.

Long story short the auditor tried his best as we in IT had for some time to convince the IT Director of the need to secure the network. Ended up he placed us under a warning to have it fixed before the next audit date.

Well in the next six months before I ended up moving on the network was hit multiple times by security issues.

t3_d1s6ku,A Crime of Opportunity,"Let me take you back in time, to the ancient world of 2014, where Skandranonsg learns of the folly of a life of crime. The first act of this story will be told from the perspective of our local ne'er-do-wells.

----------

""Alright, ready?""

The quiet din of the industrial park is punctured by the sound of shattering glass, followed by the angry wailing of the security system, a cacophonous clock reminding the two men crawling through the barred door that their time in this place would be short.

""That one."" An arm extends towards a large TV sitting on a shelf, while the other reaches for a slim computer tower closer to the entrance. Their first haul stowed away in the back of their aging red pickup, they return for another. Not spotting anything else obviously valuable, a desk is overturned, drawers emptied, but nothing else makes it out the door except for a half-disassembled laptop from the tech's bench.

As briefly as it took you to read this section, the thieves were gone, adrenaline coursing at their act of larceny committed that night.

----------

Fortunately for the small time distributor I was working for at the time, we couldn't have asked for less intelligent thieves. It was determined immediately that this was not even remotely planned, nor was it an inside job, as the items stolen were not exactly the ideal targets.

The TV was a display model for digital signage with a proprietary controller. Without that company's software (that you get for free when you purchase a TV) and the controller, the thing is practically worthless. The desktop that was taken was just a case with a power supply and motherboard, and the laptop was pretty much a write-off already.

They just so happened to walk by 3 boxes, each containing between forty and sixty 8 GB sticks of RAM, a box with ~50 Windows 7 and 8 Pro/Business licenses. Each of those boxes weighed significantly less than what the thieves stole, but was worth orders of magnitude more.

t3_d1t4fv,"The Saga Of The Critical Server, OR, ""Quit Rebooting That Thing!""","We have a great many application servers. Most of which have been migrated to the VMWare environment, but there are still a few running on physical hosts. These systems are, for the most part, ancient and running on RHAS 4 because the app team doesn't feel like migrating those instances over.  


Since I've worked in this division, we have NEVER patched our production systems. Upon learning this, I began screaming about it to management. Of course, app support and the client engagement managers don't want to TOUCH anything in production; this division has a cowboy history and they used to make unsanctioned changes in the middle of the day and bring clients down. The blowback was, ""Don't touch production. AT ALL!"" Hence, no OS patches.  


All of this has changed since InfoSec started scanning our systems and finding security vulnerabilities caused by a lack of patching. Suddenly, management wants us to patch this crap. Except for the RedHat 4 servers, which already are at the latest patch level since, well, it's OLD.

&amp;#x200B;

So we do a patch prep. Non-prod was patched last year. Nobody wanted to touch prod at the time. We applied more non-prod patches a few months ago, and now it's time to patch prod. I tell the PM to NOT patch the physical app servers because they're running RedHat 4. Offshore is handling the patching.  


Saturday night, I get a panicked call from the Project Manager. Offshore rebooted a physical server as a pre-patch sanity check, and it *didn't come back up*. They can't access the iLO. Well, this is great. My data center admin is on vacation and won't be back until next week, and this is likely going to require a trained tech attaching a console to the server and fixing it. The only trained tech who can do this is yours truly, and I'm in another state. We get the app team on the line and ask them if they could, pretty please, deploy the application instances that this server hosts onto the VMs that I made available for just this purpose SIX FUCKING MONTHS AGO? We're essentially at half capacity and when people start using the system Monday morning that half is NOT going to cut it.  


App team says that it's a significant effort to migrate the application to the VMs. It took them a month to get DR migrated. (Funny, that, you lazy jackasses have had SIX to do prod!). My boss asks if there's ANY alternative. Well, I can open a work order to have a data center technician disconnect and reconnect the power to the server and hope that it fixes the iLO. This is a Gen 6 HP, which means ilo100 or iLO2. We've got another Gen6 that has a profoundly broken ilo100, so I'm not optimistic. Boss says to open an expedited request. $$$$  


Well, after the power cycle, I'm able to access the iLO and get in to the console. The server boots up fine, but the network is...well...*NYET*working. I dig in, and discover that bond0 has NO active aggregators. A check of all 8 physical interfaces shows that only ONE of them is active, and when I look at the interface configuration, I see that it's master is bond0...but it's NOT A SLAVE. This file was last touched in 2014. I fix the configuration and restart the network, and it comes up. I make a mental note to talk to my boss Monday morning about the lack of network redundancy on this *mission critical* app server.  


Of course, I'm pissed at offshore. They rebooted a server without first verifying console access. I assumed that this physical server was running RHAS 4...it's not. It's running RHEL 6 like the VMs are. That explains the patching, but had I examined it closer, I would have told them to defer this server until the data center admin was back, and we would perform a firmware update prior to applying OS patches.   


  
So, last night, I get a panicked call from the Incident Management team. It seems that our source code repository is down. As I'm getting ready to call in to the bridge and yell at someone for waking me up for a NON-PRODUCTION OUTAGE, my offshore guy calls me. To tell me that the code repository server is down. And of yeah, so is the *mission critical* application server from the previous night.  


I tell him to forget the damned code server, THIS outage is the priority. I login to the iLO and bring up the console and the server is up. Except, there's a syslog message on the terminal that the ethernet link has gone down.  


The **sole** network interface is no longer connected to the network. Now, I'm well aware of the default response when there's a server issue to blame the network, but in this case, ethtool reports that the interface has NO LINK. That's a goddamned network problem. I tell offshore that the server is fine, but he needs to call the network team and get them to fix the network. I stress this again: the server is FINE. The NETWORK is broken. Fix the ***NETWORK***.

&amp;#x200B;

I go back to bed, and an hour later, incident management calls again. They need the data center phone number because there appears to be a power issue. I give them the number and try to go back to sleep. They can sort out if the data center is having an issue, or if we've lost a power strip.  


An hour later, my phone rings AGAIN. It's my data center admin. He's back from Burning Man, but he's sick as a dog. The data center called him because the incident manager tried to use MY credentials to get information, and they'll be sending me a password reset link. She she works for the company and NOT our division, she has NO access to the data center. Incident management calls me as I'm telling my admin to take some NyQuil and get some sleep.  


A month ago, I had received a notification that the data center was replacing an end-of-life piece of power equipment that would take down circuit A. All of the important stuff has 2 power supplies, plugged in to power strips on circuits A and B. I had completely forgotten about this because I got the notice a month ago, and, well, we've got redundancy. Plus, I'm half asleep. The network admin tells me that they lost a FEX. He gets the data center tech to check and it's got both power supplies plugged in to the same power strip. At this point, it clicks. The last time I was at the data center, my admin was telling me that we've got several power strips that are failing, and when he asks for maintenance windows to replace them, he gets told, ""DON'T TOUCH THAT! IT'S CRITICAL PRODUCTION!"" We had lost a power strip a while back, and he had to relocate device power to keep the other one from becoming overloaded. This FEX was one of those devices.  


But it's back up now. The code repository is available and still running. But that app server? Nobody can access it. Offshore says, ""Oh, I reset the server to try and fix it.""  


*YOU DID WHAT?*  


I remember, VERY CLEARLY, telling him, ""**There's nothing wrong with the server. Fix the network.**""  
Bruh. No matter HOW MANY TIMES you reboot a server, it's NOT going to fix the dead switch that it's plugged in to.  


I check the iLO and the fucking thing is POWERED OFF. I boot the server and verify that the network is functional, and tell the app support team to bring up the application. Which takes 45-60 minutes.   


Today, I'm in meeting to discuss mitigating single points of failure. The data center is doing maintenance on circuit B tonight, so we'll see if we have any devices plugged in to ONLY that circuit. The app team is getting yelled at for not migrating their app to VMWare. I made SURE that the onshore Major Incident Manager got that in her ticket: This app needs to be migrated off of the physical server ASAP.

t3_d1tzkb,"Well, it's a P1 to me!","I work on a help desk that supports several large companies both in call centers and engineering. The team of 10 I'm part of supports one of those large companies as their level 1-4 help desk. Earlier today a user called my colleague to report her laptop missing from her office. Before she could even finish writing the ticket, the user called me, nearly freaking out and asking if I could make the ticket a P1. I said I could raise the urgency from 3 to 1 and did so, then hung up. 5 minutes passed and she called another colleague. She's lost it. Again she's asking why the issue isn't a P1, he starts to explain to her that a P1 is reserved for issues where the company is pretty much burning and mass amounts of users are unable to work. Before he can finish, she screams at him ""Well it's a p1 to me!"" He finishes explaining that we've elevated it far as we can and she can go talk to local if she wants. 20 minutes pass after the call and the ticket gets updated by local, the laptop was her loaner that local had picked back up.

t3_d1eg3u,Emergency Callout: Customer crushed without important data!,"I just saw a post making mention of a similar situation which reminded me of this, and thought you guys might get a giggle/facepalm out of it.

I do device repairs &amp; technical support for quite a few families and businesses locally, and a couple of years back received an emergency call. The owner of one of the businesses I support had purchased a new phone and needed to know how to transfer important data to it from her old phone. I order a taxi, grab my laptop and head out. It turned out the ""important data"" was her Candy Crush progress, but she didn't let me know this until I arrived.

I tried to make light of it - I wasn't particularly amused at having my evening interrupted for this - and deadly serious, she snapped back that it was important because she was trying to give up smoking and she needed it to relax during work breaks.

I looked up how to do it (via Facebook account, it turns out; she had never logged in on the old phone), transferred the data over and charged her double time for the post-5pm call out.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_d0vg69,Got your email password changed and sent the new password to your email,"Super quick one.

Customer A (a company director) emails me to get email password for customer B (employee) changed. Doesn't specify the password so gets a randomly-generated one, and gets replied back with it. 

A couple hours/days (don't remember) go by and customer B calls in that they can't get into their email. I use the new password, just to see if it wasn't reset again, or if I didn't use the wrong password after all. I log in no problem, but there is a new email called ""New password"" from A, and the contents are pretty much:

*Hi B, we had your email password reset, here's the new one: ########*

-_-

I explain we were asked to change the password, then provided it to B. Didn't say anything else and let them to form their own opinion on the matter.

**Edit:**

 so after reading some comments, it appears the impression is that this is about security, this is not the case. The people I work with are sometimes even incapable of writing the password the correct way, let alone remembering it, and sometimes they don't even have a personal address. And yes, I do have root access, which has the capability to access any mailbox without the password for it.

The point was that the Customer A sent the new password of the email account, to that same email account that had the password changed, expecting the B to be able to read the the email, because Catch-22.

t3_d0ztx1,Flash problems,"I was once on a ticket for ""Flash problems"" and I was told that someone was having trouble with their browser was not able to get them to do the site. I asked them over the phone which browser they were using and if they had tried another browser. They told me that they were using Chrome and that they were told that it works best for this site(This was before Google brought extra buttons to push for Flash to work). I was confused by why she insisted on using Flash, and not Internet Explorer. I eventually went to her desk and asked if she could show me the site that she was going to and why Chrome was such an important part to use on this site. She showed me Chrome, which was obviously in Incognito Mode, though she didn't mention it. I asked her what site she was having the problem with. She showed me Facebook, which wasn't uncommon for her department because she planned events from time to time. When I asked what part of Facebook was causing her problems, she immediately flipped to the Candy Crush game and said that the Flash game was giving her trouble and she was asking for help with the level that she was on. I told her that it wasn't a flash problem, and that she could have waited for after work to play the game. Turns out that she was told that she was told by a co-worker that she could only play it in Incognito mode at work because she ""was being tracked by IT"" I told her that we don't regularly do that without cause and that playing games might be a cause for some people. She heard me and still asked me for tips on how to beat the level. Honestly, I had no idea, because she was on a way higher level than me",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d0wos1,Why do we have to upgrade so often?!,"Much to the chagrin of the creature known as the ""Accountant"", time marches on. As is the case in the following case. The thing you should know is that there is a JAVA based program that requires no admin access to install and is platform independent, used to send in many forms to various authorities. Let us skip the menial diagnostics and go to the good stuff, shall we?

&amp;#x200B;

Customer: I can't send in my form!

Me: Could you check the program version? It is in the bottom left corner. 

Customer: \*reads out version that is over a year old\*

Me: You will need to update the program, as you are running a very outdated version, which will not be able to send your forms, and even if you manage to do it, it will get rejected due to being out of date. You can do it in the updates tab.

Customer: Okay, I will try. It is not working.

Me: \*after much diagnosing I feel dread dawn upon me...\* .... Say, in the very bottom left of your screen, do you see the start menu button?

Customer: Yes.

Me: ....What does it look like?

Customer: It says Start, obviously.

\*initialize facepalm.exe\*

Me: You are running Windows XP... Please consider upgrading to at least Windows 7 in order to be able to use services, as XP is no longer supported by anyone, including the developer.

Customer: But It works just fine! Are YOU gonna pay for my new computer?!

Me: \*it dawns on me that the PC is also comparable in technology\* ...Unfortunately literally no one supports XP anymore. I cannot say anything other than you will need to upgrade.

Customer:  You can't force me to buy a new system!

Me: Indeed, that is why it is platform independent. You may run it on anything that the latest JAVA runs on, including free systems.

Customer: Why do you have to change everything all the time?! Goodbye!

t3_d0t016,The Tale of the ClearText Externals,"So, you want to hear a tale from tech? Sure thing. Sit down, grab your C64 Bodypillow and be amazed or frightened or whatever..

***The Tale of the Cleartext Externals***

Some may know that I am now working a day (or Night-)job to earn my cookies. Some may have caught that I'm helping the owner of that place of work in IT. She's been paying some dude *60€/Month* since sept 2016 to make a website. Thats about... yeah... three years. The website never existed, and according to the logs, never even has been worked on. So, being the IT Prodigy she reveres me for, I offer to step up and get it done (for a nice one time fee), since the competition is doing mad online stuff like inviting the youth to a BBQ and getting massive karma points.

The host for both domain and webspace is a local company. Hard red flag, as their own website **404**s out on their products and descriptions, uses basic html with lots of .html files in &lt;iframe&gt; tags. It took me three weeks to get access data. But wait, there is more...

See, in the modern age, password protection of online related stuff is quite, let's say, important, with the GDPR and DSGVO and other multi-letter acronyms. So, first step is to take the user name, and request a password reset. The simplest thing for some company who charges about six hundred euros per year for ""web hosting"", right?

We keep waiting. Four hours later, the reset mail does not arrive, on neither of the adresses listed. Instead, now the password reset form **404**s as well. By now its a saturday evening and they will most likely have gone home. I still have a full night shift ahead of me.

Come past Monday I call. Note: They do not know me. I simply stated that I work for my Boss and need access data. Without verification, they tell me the username(s). But not the password. This is bad. No backcheck with the boss, no security question, over the central phone line. Queue the Gnome waving a huge red flag in the background.

Frustrated I instruct $Boss, who isn't very tech savy, what to demand from them and what I need to get it running before making the website happen. By now I have created a complete portfolio of the companies services, values, and contact info on my own webspace, I'd just need to mirror it over.

Wait until past wednesday. I get two emails from $boss. My eyes start sweating profusely because they sent over the password. In clear text. No ""Claim Password"" link. No Security verification again. The only way this Password was ""encrypted"" (as they stated in the mail), was...

It was written with ~~strikethrough~~. Because **THAT** will make it unreadable.

I login. It's not an account with any access to any features. I can simply read the logs, and see they didn't touch the account since october 2016.

Slightly horrified, I call. This time with $boss' Authorization so they know I'm allowed to take this project over. And here is, where the Nightmare actually began.

$phone: ""*Hello, this is WebhostingCompany XY, I'm the Intern $bla, how can I help you?*""

$me: ""*Hey, this is Dex speaking on behalf of $bosscompany. You just sent over a password in cleartext, but the account has no access to the Web hosting features like FTP and SQL, the two things you've been instructed to.*""

$bla: ""*Thats odd. Can you give me the username and password so I can check it out for myself?*""

I am slightly taken aback by this request. 

$me: ""*Your company just sent it over, and in line with data protection laws I am not allowed to say this password just out loud in the open space over a phone. Please either note a callback from someone in the Hosting department or a supervisor. I am sorry that it hits you but this is really not acceptable.*""

$bla: ""*I understand, Can I take notes of what is needed?*""

(Side note: Be nice to people at the phone. I've worked that job myself and you're 100% more likely to get help if you are not a douchecanoe)

$me: ""*Sure. I need FTP and SQL access and working login data for both, and this is not given in the account your company sent me, which my boss is paying an exorbitant amount for each year. Also, sending passwords in clear text with strikethrough isn't exactly secure, nor up to modern standards.""*

$bla: ""*I can send the FTW and SQL thingies over to my supervisor, but we can't do anything about the passwords.*""

$me (curious): ""*Uh... why?*""

$bla: ""*We have an external sales team of two that keeps all of them in a printed list so we have to ask them to send it to us. Then we can relay them to you or other customers.*""

At this point, I'm trying to keep composure. It is September 2019. Someone out there has a PRINTED LIST OF ROOT PASSWORDS FOR A BUNCH OF COMPANIES. Someone not even AFFILIATED WITH THE HOST.

Internal Screaming.

$me: ""*Okay. I'd like to get at least a callback to the FTP and SQL issues, so the website still can go online.*""

$bla (really cheerful): ""*I'll get right on it. Thank you for calling!*""

I haven't received a callback yet. Instead I've been spending my time to get $boss to switch the host ASAP.

Thats my most recent tale of trying to salvage the IT in a company whose sole IT worker before has been mysteriously absent but still been collecting wages for a few years.

t3_d0hpol,Remote connection doesn't work!,"Today a short tale that reminds us never to underestimate the nonchalance with which clients give you wrong and imprecise information about their problem:

Situation: Customer is a small company that operates an office and a workshop location. Employees from the workshop location sometimes RDP into a machine in the office because this is the only way they can operate some bad 30 year old software they use. In order to start the RDP connection they simply click the RDP icon on the desktop and enter their credentials.

Client: ""Hey, the remote connection doesn't work!""

Me: ""Ok, what exactly doesn't work? Is there an error message?""

Client: ""Well there used to be an error message. I don't remember what it said. Now it just doesn't work.""

Me: ""So what happens when you try to establish the connection? Just nothing?""

Client: ""The icon is gone. I can't do anything.""

Me: ""Ok, let me do a remote support session on your machine then.""

\*\* client starts our remote support software and let's me connect \*\*

Me: ""Indeed, the icon is gone. It also isn't in the recycling bin. Let me check the RDP connection software.""

\*\* I look at the software and it's completely empty. Like that client-machine never had established an RDP connection to a server-machine... \*\*

Me: ""Well that's strange... it looks like every trace of the RDP connection has disappeared. And you tell me it just did this by itself?""

Client: ""Yes, as I said... there once was some error message and then the icon just disappeared!""

Me: ""Ok, let me just get the connection information and credentials so that I can setup the connection again.""

\*\* While getting the credentials  for the RDP connection it started to dawn on me...  \*\*

Me: ""Hey, just another question... the Desktop I'm connected to right now... is this the Desktop of the PC in your workshop or did you already establish the remote connection to the office and then connect me into that?""

Client: ""Ah, yes, I already connected to the office. I thought that makes it easier for you.""

Me: ""... well ... but you said your problem was that you can't establish the remote connection... so this obviously can't be the case if we in fact right now are connected...""

Client: ""Now look, it doesn't work! I can't start BADSOFTWARETHEYUSE! The icon is missing.""

Me: ""Oh, well, that's quite a different issue then...""

\*\* I go to the location of the EXE of the bad software, make a new desktop shortcut to replace the one that he obviously deleted and he was happy again...  a case that could have been solved in about 15 seconds if the guy cared to give a halfway correct description of his actual problem ... \*\*",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d0k82u,Speakers aren't working!,"I got a call from a wedding and corporate event venue I do tech support for. They said on the phone ""The lower speaker is working for the music, but the upper speakers aren't. How can we get the upper speakers to play the music?""

I called them on FaceTime to diagnose. The ""lower"" speaker they were talking about was the subwoofer found in the cabinet with the AV equipment. The upper speakers weren't producing sound even though they could hear the rumble from the sub.

I had the staff check the connections to the sub. All fine. Then I had them point the camera at the AV receiver. The volume was set to 19. It defaults to 60 when you turn it on, so someone must have turned it down. I told the staff ""Turn the receiver volume up to 60.""

Staff: ""Won't that be super loud?""

Me: ""It'll be fine.""

Staff, talking to the client whose phone had the music on it they wanted to play: ""Ok can you get music playing? We're going to turn the volume up to 60. But turn your phone down to half volume so it's not super loud if it works.""

Me: \*headdesk\*

Staff: ""It's still not working. We can hear the lower speaker but nothing is coming from the upper speakers.""

Me: ""Turn the phone volume up to 100%.""

Staff: ""Won't that be super loud?""

Me: ""It won't. Just turn it up slowly.""

Staff: ""I'm worried that's going to be super loud.""

Me: ""*Please* turn the phone volume up to 100%. Trust me.""

Staff did what I asked. Sound *magically* started coming from the speakers.

Staff: ""Oh! We fixed it. Kthxbye."" And they hung up.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Alright, can I just close them all en-masse as an exception?

Superiors: What? No, that would mess up the statistics.

Me: So you are telling me, that dealing with 500 spams in an efficient manner will mess up your statistics... cant you just edit it to indicate this?

Superiors: Obviously not, that is madness.

Me: I can even rig you up something that will just open 500 forms and tag them as spam.

Superiors: Yeah, but they would not be linked.

Me: \*sigh\* Why don't we have a spam filter anyway?!

Superiors: We do. 

Me: Techincally yes, but it tags literally everything as spam and then lets it all through anyway. So no.

Superiors: Listen, just let them all in and close them. Easy.

Me: Listen, due to the shitty programs, computers, and orders we have, each of them will take 20 secs, so altogether, about 3 hours. That is, IF I do not get disturbed or slowed down. And both of those *will* happen.

Superiors: So you still have enough time afterwards, yes?

Me: You mean after that other task I have to do, besides being on call for emergencies, *and* the regular work I am actually here for, alone, because you have been incapable of properly staffing us for ages? On a foreign computer I will have to set up from scratch, because you decided that now is the ideal time for a grand cleaning in our room?

t3_d0nhu5,How someone paid over 200.000 NOK for four laptops.,"About 20.000 dollars.

This story takes place over a few years.

cast: BossA1 and A2, and BossB, BuildingA and B, CompanyA and B. And me from companyA.

Many years ago it was decided to sort out a mess with staff, owners and buildings.

You see the staff in buildingB was working for companyA while BossB was working for companyB in buildingB. We were going to  sort a to a and b to b.

Because of legal things BossB could not go back to the old analog way of archiving mail and letters, after companyA had gone digital. It was too expensive and completely unrealistic that companyB could house their own servers in buildingB.

So it was to be that companyB was going to pay companyA for use of dark fiber. BuildingB had dark fiber from A, it was up to me to set the price of it, included was a bit extra for those one minute jobs that is not really worth sending an extra bill for. I gave the numbers to BossA1 and forgot about/ignored it. 

BossA1 went into retirement with A2 replacing him. Company A and B where still not completely separated at this point and there was minimal tech support needed a few AP that needed resetting, a printer in a GPO. This was covered in the small extra money they paid for internet.

Then they wanted some new laptops, finally something big enough to care sending a bill. I set them up and went to BossA2 and asked to add four laptops pluss time to set them up to the usual bill we were sending them.

BossA2 could not find a trace of anything about internet or an agreement with companyB.

And that is how someone paid 200.000 NOK for a couple of laptops (and use of our fiber for a few years)",talesfromtechsupport

UserB sent me an email the UserA could not log in and needed thier password reset. So I reset it and go about my day.

2 hours later I get a call from UserA saying they can't log in anymore and they need my help ASAP. Due to me being somewhat fresh in the company I try to be very on top of things and go to people office to meet them and figure out thier issue in real time. 

When I get there I want to actually facepalm. The user was already logged into the domain and had been all logged in all day. So I ask him to show me the issue...... He typed his username in wrong to Outlook and could not log in. So I point out the proper structure of our emails. So he corrects the issue and try to log in again... His password won't work..... Of course he forgot he had asked UserB to ask for a password reset which happens at the AD lvl and syncs with 365. He never reset his password. So I had him log out and log in with his reset password which then promptly asked him to create a new password which of course he struggles with because he tries to make his new password his original password. I inform his about password rules and he corrects his error. Logs into the domain and then his email.

All that hassle just because the user didn't read his credentials and just thought it was right before asking for a reset...

At least he was really nice about it and felt silly.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_d01zqu,Earned my keep today.,"&gt;Is turbojelly there?

A quivering voice asked from outside the Workroom. Recognising the call to action, I took a final sip of my Tech Fuel (coffee to you non techs) and turned to face my latest ~~idiot~~ user in distress.

&gt;Sure, what's the problem?

I asked, not realising that I was about to test my tech knowledge to the limit!

&gt;The Thingy's Broken!

The small, unsuspecting student replied. Eyeing my victim, my many years of experience told me that the lack of computer upon their person inevitably meant that the offending device was in their classroom and the child had been sent to escort me to the location.


&gt;Lead the way.

I replied. Off we went. Stalking through the quiet halls of a school during lessons heading to the room that held my adversary.


&gt;Here it is!

The teacher presented me a laptop with symbols on the screen the class was unable to decipher. One glance and I was able to recognise the symbols formed a language that was was descended from several ancient forms and was more commonly known as ""English"".


Lucky for them I am semi-fluent so I set to work deciphering the 3 word message that had a class of educators and educatees stumped:


&gt;""Continue To Boot""


Instantly my years of IT Support came into affect. Mental Flow charts started processing incoming data. Results where compared to my vast internal database of problems and fixes until, finally, a solution presented itself.


With no flourish or fanfare I leant forward, the whole room holding it's breath to watch the wonder of a magical fix. My eyes found their target, sending commands to my finger to reach out and stab once at the keyboard in front of me. Years of experience guiding my digit as it descending to one key in particular. An arrow point to the left with a little upwards tail.



My herculean task complete, the laptop continued to boot and the log on screen soon appeared. My job done, I wandered back to my lair, safe in the knowledge that I had more than earned my pay for the day. Success.

So while sitting at a users desk, like clockwork, one of their co-workers will pass by and say: ""Wait, you're not Linda!"" or various versions of: ""Wow Linda you've certainly changed your look today, haha!""

t3_d08j6a,Watch as I flex my money muscles,"As mentioned before, tech support for the Fruit-based enterprise. Here's one from this week.

This customer calls in with a 2015 desktop computer, which at the time would've cost around $1500 new. I also notice he is a loyal customer. He's pretty much got at least one of each device (iPhones, iPads, Watches, TV).

C: Customer

M: Me

After introducing myself and asking what's up, he says this:

C - ""I've bought this computer around 2.5 years ago but Sunday was the first time I opened it and turned it on. I hear it chime and the keyboard plays sounds, but I can't see anything.""

&amp;#x200B;

After a brief pause for disbelief, I checked and the computer had actually been bought over 3 years ago and didn't have any indication that it had been used before.

After doing the usual spiel of key combinations, resets and pointing a flashlight on the screen (an image can be visible like this if the backlight is busted), we quickly determine this is a hardware failure and a repair is needed. The issue of course, is that he is out of warranty and needs to pay up.

&amp;#x200B;

C - ""But this computer is new, it's the first time I'm using it! Surely something was wrong from the factory!""

Me - ""Right, but warranties count from the day you buy it, not the day you first use it. And there's no way to tell it was not working from the day you got it, you never used it, right?""

C - ""No, it's been sat in my office since I got it. You can see I'm a loyal customer, surely there has to be some consideration for this! You just can't outright say I need to go and pay.""

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing that this is a lost cause, I made up some bullshit about inactive electronic components and how they can seize up if they are inactive for a long time, like a car, but he can just have the computer seen and then see what he wants to do.

We agree to this and he's supposed to email me when he goes to get a report. As we say goodbyes, I tried to save face and asked him for feedback.

""You were fine and I liked the way you took my call, that's why I want you to continue this case with me.""

t3_d04n0a,Hurricane Dorian Aftermath,"This story literally happened yesterday. So being the sole IT admin of a company based in Miami that produces juices for supermarkets, I was very stressed over what kind of damage Dorian could cause us. I triple checked everything and prepped the entire company. Shutdown procedures, verified backups both local and offsite, tarps, garbage bags, disconnected anything that didn't need to be connected, etc. I did not want to deal with anything unnecessarily when I came back (magic sentence right here.)

So here is the story for what I had to deal with that could've been avoided in the first 5 minutes of my day rather than going in circles for 2 hours.

IT Guy = Me

QC Lady = Important lady who inadvertently tried to save my day

As I'm walking in first thing 8am, users are already re-connecting their gear to get their day started. Almost instantly, I'm being pulled away to our plant because no one can get online.

IT Guy: Fuck. Did a switch goes out?

Right before I'm carted away, a user by the name of ""QC Lady"" stopped me and asked for help.

QC Lady: IT Guy, I reconnected my computer but I can't get online. Can you stop by and take a look?

IT Guy:  Give me a sec. The plant is apparently down. Let me take a look at that first and I'll stop by your office and see whats up.

I rush over and find all my gear in my cab online and working. What is even more interesting is that half the phones in the plant office cannot dial out or receive calls and all PCs have internet, but are having a hard time reaching resources across the LAN. I somehow manage to get the PCs behaving again, but the phones are still FUBAR. After a bit, I get a call that the president is having issues with wifi. Away I go!

I find the president with his laptop stating he cannot connect to our ERP. But he can access the internet. Strange, this is just like in the plant. I do some basic trouble shooting and decide to check what IP his laptop has so I can check the wireless controller.

Just for some background, my network is technically two physical networks. I have a Data network (192.168.1.x) with multiple VLANs to split off things like Guest Wifi, Corp LAN, MGT, etc. and a separate, flat Voice network (192.168.100.x). These networks are not connected. They never talk to each other because the VOIP vendor is finicky. Some of you will already know where this is going.

So I pull up an ipconfig /all on his laptop and see ""[192.168.100.138](https://192.168.100.138)""

IT Guy: ...what? WHAT?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

I was furious because how the fuck is this machine getting this IP?

IT Guy: ...shit. I have a bridge somewhere.

I started panicking because this bridge could be literally anywhere. I have my MDF and a couple of IDFs littered about due to this operation spanning across multiple buildings.

So I took a step back from my panicking and logged into my core switch. Sure as shit, my ARP table has about 50+ more devices than what I'm accustomed to seeing. I needed a plan to try and get this resolved quickly. Because if I take too long, everyone will have finished re-connecting themselves and I'll never get anything done once the complaints start flooding in.

IT Guy: Ok. I can now see an entire network when I shouldn't be able to. How can I use this to find this fucking bridge.

So I started thinking. I know what's SUPPOSED to be on my Data network and vice versa. And I know of two devices that live in the MDF together, but do not talk to each other ever. So I grabbed the MAC of my firewall and the MAC on our VOIPs router. I know where my uplinks are supposed to be on all my IDF switches, so lets do some probing.

I log into all of my IDF switches at once, checked my ARP tables against my firewall's MAC and get:

G49, G50, G26, G50, G25

Ok. That's correct. Let's check the router

G3, G50, G26, G50, G25.

IT Guy: G3? Who is this?

I walk over to this IDF switch, find G3, pull out my phone that is un-fucking-fortunately on the VOIP IP range, and start pinging the VOIP router. I pull G3 and...

IT Guy: It stopped. What port is this?

I check my patch panel and its D16. I check the office this IDF is in and I find D16. Guess who it belongs to?

QC Lady: Hey! Ready for me? Did you fix the issue in the plant?

She had plugged in her phone correctly, but then plugged the PC port into D16, essentially bridging the two networks. I removed the cable, connected her PC correctly, re-connected G3 and for some reason heard Gordon Ramsay saying ""Finally. Some delicious fucking networking""

I'm sure there could've been an easier and faster way to find this bridge, but honestly I'm lucky that my method to find it worked and it was just a simple fix to reverse it.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_d05kbd,Users. What are they good for?,"My job technically has nothing to do with tech support.  We do have an IT person at work, who is responsible for that sort of thing.  But my office is over the road from the main building, and as the only person in our building who even approximates to technical competence, I am often the ""we can't be bothered to phone over the road to talk to the real tech support"" person, or the ""our tech support person is on holiday"" person, and end up doing the first level of troubleshooting.

Which leads to a lot of stupid questions.

Especially on Wednesdays.

Because I work in an archive, and Wednesdays are when our most technically inept volunteers are here.  And so, every Wednesday, I brace myself for a slew of exceedingly stupid problems which turn out in fact not to be the computer misbehaving at all, but our volunteers being unable to follow the most basic of instructions.

Which brings me to yesterday.

For context, some of our volunteers are working on a digitisation project, where they scan archive items on a flatbed scanner, and add metadata to the resulting files so they can be searched for.

So yesterday, my... &lt;sarcasm&gt;favourite&lt;/sarcasm&gt;... volunteer came into my office to tell me that there was a problem with one of the photographs that had been\* scanned.  Okay, I said.  What's the problem?  The problem is that it had been saved with the wrong filename.  Okay, that's easy enough to fix.  So I change the filename.  Next step: ask $volunteer to make sure that the label for the physical photograph records the correct filename, rather than the filename that it was incorrectly originally saved as.  $volunteer: ""Well, I didn't scan it.""  Okay, but it was meant to be in the box that they were working on.  So we look through the box, and sure enough it's not there.  Okay.  Wonderful.  Brilliant.

So $volunteer leaves the box they were working on with me, and leaves as they need to go.  I double-check the box.  Photo definitely still not there.  I check $volunteer's *other* box.  Photo not there either.  Okay.  Fine.  Great.

So I check the digital version of the photo for clues.  It was scanned last week, on the day that our problem volunteer was in.  Into the folder that they work in.  And it was scanned with a filename suggesting that it was in the box that they were working on last week.  Double check that box.  Still not there.  Go back to the file metadata.  `Owner: $volunteer`.  So much for ""I didn't scan it"".

Go into the office that volunteer was working in, to see if it had been left around somewhere there.  Not on the desk.  Open up the flatbed scanner.  Turns out that I have just wasted twenty minutes searching for the photo which the volunteer had left *in the flatbed scanner*, and somehow had failed to notice in five hours working at that workstation.

God only knows what they were *doing* in that time.

t3_d04mup,Default action: shutdown,"My employer has to exchange data with other companies regularly using a special interface format and dedicated communication lines. For whatever reason, they decided to do this using IPv6 - not unusual today, but definitely unusual when your own hardware/OS combo does not support IPv6 at all and using an application protocol the server application was not able to digest.

To make this communication possible, they introduced a kind of gateway machine, translating IPv4 / IPv6 (easy) and $legacyapplicationprotocol / $newapplicationprotocol (also easy but not COTS). 

We received lots of calls that, whenever any of the local users had to do a manual server switch on that gateway (redundant components A and B, had to be switched regularly to ensure viability of standby component), chances were &gt;30% the server would shut down. Analysis soon showed that all of the users had been trained to do server switches using an application dialog window with all maintenance activities to choose from. 

During training, switchover had always been preselected as the default option and so they learned to just open the window and press &lt;ENTER&gt; (to execute the pre-selected switchover) and &lt;ENTER&gt; again to confirm the action. As you can imagine, most never even read the confirmation dialog.

The production version of the software was different in a small but crucial detail - the maintenance activities had been reordered in that selection window and so ""OS shutdown"" for whatever reason was the preselected entry - always a safe choice, right? A third of the users apparently never realised this because apparently they just did what they had been trained to do - open dialog, &lt;ENTER&gt;, &lt;ENTER&gt;. And because management had saved 20-30€ there was no IPMI / OBM access to remotely power the server on again...

Users were re-trained NOT to just use this ""fire and forget"" method, the rate of unintended shutdowns went down to maybe 20% - some users simply had apparently hard-wired the original training into their brain.

A few months later, we finally were able to convince management that this particular setup was not as brilliant as they thought. So after much deliberation, the SW vendor introduced a new activity in that selection window called ""do nothing"" and made this the default selection - far safer, although we then received calls stating ""server switchover doesn't work""...

t3_czv3wj,I flew to Ohio because someone couldn't figure out how to charge their laptop,"This happened last week, well the trip did, this situation has been going on for over 3 months.

I work for a large company and we have sales reps all over the country.  I'm the product owner/systems owner for a lot of the tools and technology that our sales people use. I'm not technically in technology, but I have a development background, so end up getting involved and protecting a lot of our IT staff from stupidity...

Anyway, one of our long term sales reps, who is based in the middle of nowhere in Ohio (a 2 hour drive from Columbus airport) called in to tech support about 3 months ago stating that her laptop wasn't working.  We had our annual sales meeting in  June so we told her to bring the laptop with her as we always bring some of the IT folks for stuff like this.  She brings the laptop and IT lead notices battery is dead so charges it up and it turns on fine.  We tell sales rep, she confirms it's working now and we thought it was a fluke or maybe a bad charger so we gave her a spare charger.

The week after the sales meeting she emails and calls us to say that the issue is back her laptop won't turn on.  And she charged it all night with the new charger.  We start thinking something could be wrong, so we order her a replacement send it out and send her a box to send her laptop back in.  She confirms replacement is working and we received her laptop charged it up and it worked fine, so we ended up testing and reissuing it to someone else who didn't have any issues.

A few days go by and sales rep calls in again and tells us the same issue with her laptop, it's not turning on. We ran through troubleshooting and our IT lead did a facetime call with her and she was completely belligerent at this point. Yelling at me our IT staff and my manager who is the CIO of our division.

We ended up sending her multiple replacements and they would consistently stop working after about 3 days.  She sent an email to all our C level executives complaining about me and the IT staff that we keep sending her broken computers and don't understand laptops and that she wants one of us to come to her home office ASAP otherwise she's entertaining offers from competitors.  Well Head of Sales told us we needed to fix this...

She refused to come into us even though part of her territory is only 2 hours from us.  And since she made a big stink so my pregnant ass (yep I'm pregnant) had to fly to her last week.  She wouldn't even meet me in Columbus at a hotel, I had to drive 2 hours to her home office.

So I get to her home office and she shows me her laptop and the charger and what's going on....

The plug for the charger has a square back instead of a round one, it's almost the same shape as where the ethernet cord goes.  Guess where she was putting the charger...  So that is why her 8 or so laptops we sent her stopped working after 2-3 days, the battery would die because she wasn't charging it properly.  I taped a sticky on the top of her laptop with an arrow pointing to the left where the charger goes so she doesn't get confused.

She barely thanked me and told me it was my fault for changing our laptops from HP to Dell that there are too many square holes so how is she supposed to know where the charger goes.  I didn't make that call BTW, our parent company did because they had a better lease agreement.

And to make matters worse when I got there she said to me ""Oh you look puffy, have you gained weight?""  NO I'M PREGNANT, BUT NOT PREGNANT ENOUGH TO REALLY TELL ANYONE YET AND THAT IS WHY I'M PUFFY YOU A\*HOLE. I obviously didn't say that, but I told her it was from the flight and the 2 hour drive from the airport.

She's a jerk.

&amp;#x200B;

Update:  Wow I don't think I ever had this many upvotes on a post before!  I realized I left out a few things that I wanted to mention:

* We did ask her several times and sent her pictures of where the charging cord goes. She is the squeaky wheel in the top 5 sales people at the company so when she complains she gets heard.  After her initial facetime with us she refused to send pictures or get on a facetime with us so to satisfy the squeaky wheel we kept sending her new laptops.  
* IT Support made a betting pool before I left for Ohio then on vacation as to what he problem was.  I bet on the fact that she didn't have the charger plugged into the wall, not that she couldn't figure out where to plug into the laptop.  However, my favorite IT support person bet on this exact thing and won $285.  
* There isn't anyone else in IT local to her.  Our HQ is in NYC (where I'm from) and we only have IT staff in HQ where I""m based out of as well as in NJ.  We tossed around the idea of hiring a sub-contractor to work with us for this incident local to Ohio but in case something was really wrong with equipment we really needed someone from our team to handle. 
* While I was at the Columbus airport on Wednesday last week waiting for my flight back to LaGuardia I did write an email, which I saved in drafts, but sent today after reading some of your responses thanking her for hosting me in her quaint home town and that I was glad that it was just confusion on her part as to where the latptop charging cord gets plugged into and that we didn't have a more major equipment issue that needed to be addressed with Dell.  
* The money for the trip technically comes out of the IT budget, however, we are a shared service, so we will bill back to sales.  Because it was labor day week my flights were very expensive in and out of LGA as well as my lyft to and from the airport.  The whole trip was nearly $2000.  
* Before I left for vacation (today was my first day back in the office after the trip) I sent out a meeting invite to our head of sales and to my manager the CIO to review what happened and how we need to put proper process in place so we don't waste time or money.  
* Going to HR will be a lost cause, HR in this company only cares about the company not the employees.  It will be a he said/she said situation and not worth the drama. Plus I know I came out on top here.",talesfromtechsupport

me:""Ok. I wish this had worked out better. Alan can finish soon and he'll leave the cleanup for your IT crew""    
  
I text Alan that he's getting paid and to leave the remaining work to the MSP. Oliver gets a longer email explaining the remaining work. 
  
Two weeks later, I get an email from Oliver. Turns out that the same lawyer tried to open the same (infected) document and, well,  they needed another referral, but someone cheaper this time as they were still sore about Alan.

t3_czxgnn,The mouse is not the problem,"First time posting. I don't have any groundbreaking stories as of right now, -I've been verry fortunate with where I work- but this one happened yesterday and to me it was quite funny.

So for this to make sense, I work in a municipality over in Norway. Normally most IT here is outsourced to an external company but I was hired as an IT apprentice here last year and even that company has begun to rely on me if there is any on hand support needed at the town hall.

Everyone I work with are quite nice and appreciative, but despite this I do still have a few dificult ones. One co-worker in particular has this, I suppose, ironic attitude with technology. As long as it works she's not too bothered. Cue her getting a new vertical mouse and asking me to have a look at er setup as the mouse ""is unable to cross over to the next monitor.""

I decide to chek it out after lunch and after a few pointers I already see the problem. See how the setup is layed out there is the laptop on the left with the screen on, and two monitors running through a docking station. After rooting around I immediately see what the problem is. I open the screen settings to see what the adjustment of the screens are. As I may had suspected. The setup worked like so: 1(laptop), 3(monitor to the left), 2(monitor to the right). I had noticed that by some mysterious force... Screen number 3 was moved way up to high-heaven and the points of connection with the other sceens were not much more than a few centimeters at the bottom one.

I quickly took a photo of the screen, corrected the screen alignment and went back to show her the issue and got some laughs out of her other colleagues.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_czkbj9,Who would have thought a button could actually be used...,"This takes place in an ATC ACC (air traffic control  area control centre), so not exactly a low tech environment. 

A few years ago, at the simple TFT displays for a weather information display were due to be replaced at every single air traffic controller working position, approx. 800 in the whole company, 100 at our site. As working in ATC is as close to real paranoia regarding system failures can get, there is even a secondary system ready to provide weather updates on that display, using a different input port, in case the primary system fails, and users can manually switch between those systems e.g. in case of a hung system, by simply pressing a button on the display's bezel, thereby toggling the input source. 

The new displays arrived, were tested intensely for any faults and generally seemed to be much better than the old ones - after 10 years of 24/7 operations those were definitely not in their prime any more.

Soon after installation, we noticed that the new displays were prone to disastrous (as in ""dead"") failures whenever a user pressed the gleaming, stylish input selector button.

Who in their right mind would ever design a button with a decorative metal fitting around the metal button that, when short-circuited by the user's finger, would fry the display's electronics? The only way to switch sources without endangering anything was with a non-conductive pen or wearing gloves. WTF? 

The manufacturer had to modify all those displays, they certainly earned no money on that sale.",talesfromtechsupport

Me: Lowly but mighty tech support specialist

Also Me: My mind, where everything goes according to plan

Janet: Concerned and slightly pissed off woman

Coworker: Co-worker who has more experience installing and troubleshooting this kind of panel


Me: Illeterate tech support, this is u/Maldor96

Janet: My panel is making noise and and a ruckus at 11:30 at night and at an ungodly hour the next day. I want a tech to come out and replace it!

Me: Slow down there, we will consider a tech if we exhaust all options over the phone.

Also Me: Oh joy another one of these.

-Verification ensues-

Me: alright, let me take a look at the history and see what is going on, you said that this is happening at 11:30 or so?

J: Yes.

M: alright look me take a look at that time, is this happening regularly or randomly

J: randomly (calming down now that I'm looking)

AM: Nothing unusual happening here, odd requests for panel programming, but thats it.

M: Any other days this has been happening?

J: its been happening since last weekend

AM: More panel programming... things

M: Ok, let me run some tests and diagnostics on the panel

J: uhmmmhmm

-All tests good-

M: The tests didnt reveal anything...

AM: Shot in the dark, but what if we replicate those messages somehow, say changing the master code?

M: Ok, so this is a bit of a long shot but let me try something. 

J: Ok.

M: Did that set the panel off?

J: ... Nope

M: Ok... Well....

J: Wait it just said it

AM: Said it?

M: Said what?

J: It just said ""System disarmed, Ready to arm"" thats what it says every time.

AM: that is speech, not noise.

M: ooooooKkayy.... Let me do it again...

J: ...

M: ...

J: There! it said it again!

M: Huh, let me confer with a colleage of mine to get an extra set of eyes on this, because that is certainly odd. Is it alright if I put you on a brief hold?

J: Sure

-customer now on hold-

Coworker: whats going on?

Me: Customer is complaining about the panel saying the system disarmed message with no interaction on her side.

CW: Yeah, it does that. Its for letting the technician know that any changes he made have been applied.

M: Oh...

AM: I'll facepalm us later.

-speaking with the customer-

M: Hi, Janet

J: Yes

M: Turns out the the panel saying that is normal for when we are progamming the panel that tells us that the programming has been applied. In terms of the time, it looks like someone is accessing the panel information and that is what is causing the panel to say that. What I'm doing is forcing all devices signed into your account to log out. Once I do that, go ahead and log in yourself

J: So someone has been getting into my panel?

M: Yes, but it doesnt have a name attached to it, so its not us who is accessing it, but the log out command I sent will kick everyone off. If it continues to speak like that, give us a call and we can reset your password.

J: Ok, i'm logged in, so if it happens I'll call?

M: yep, and we will reset the password.

J: ok Thanks!

t3_czmund,Health insurance? Which health insurance?,"It’s only tech support in the beginning, but it made me privy to this…

A few years ago, I volunteered for non-profit tech support helpline, mainly aimed at immigrants and recent arrivals in Germany – once a week we offered “bring your device, we’ll fix your problem” free of charge to anybody. 

One day Tony walked in. He was highly trained and specialized expert in his non-technical field, U.S. American by birth, who had been living and working in Germany for a few years. He wanted his computer set up so to anybody else it appeared to be in the continental U.S. My first impression was he maybe wanted to access some local/regional web site with geo blocking (making it impossible to access from IP addresses located outside the U.S.), which would have just meant to use a proxy server, but it was more serious – he wanted to “fake” living in the U.S. for the agency he bought health insurance from.

As his computer had several other issues, over the course of two or three hours his story came out piece by piece. Apparently, when he first came to Germany, it was under an American contract with his American employer who then had a separate contract with a German company. For this contracted, he applied for (and received) a working visa, and among the many papers he got was a leaflet about social security and healthcare in Germany, which stated (correctly) that with a foreign working contract you are not subject to German laws about national working contracts, and that e.g. health insurance had to be covered by his American employer, if at all. Obviously, his contract contained no health insurance, so he started buying “travel health insurance” for a few months at a time from different companies in the U.S. (to cover any medically induced costs while travelling abroad). After a year or two, his contract with the U.S. employer ran out and he was hired directly by the German firm he had been working for all the time. Again, he applied for (and received) a permanent residence visa, and again he got a lot of paperwork, which he didn’t read because to him it appeared to be duplicates of the ones he had when first moving to Germany.

The crucial difference was one particular leaflet – about health insurance and social security. As he didn’t read it, he did not know (and nobody thought to talk to him about it, as he seemed to be pretty much integrated into the community at the time) that comprehensive health insurance is mandatory in Germany, is deducted automatically from any salaries with a cost share of 50% paid by the employer and 50% by the employee. Not knowing this, he had thought he had no health insurance and continued to buy the (expensive) American health insurance contracts, always only for a few months at a time, and these contracts only covered emergencies.

The mystery how all the letters, e.g. the one welcoming him to the “default” health insurance agency (you can choose from 200+ different ones, but if you don’t choose explicitly, you just get assigned) and delivering his insurance card (which is accepted with any medical facility instead of payment) were not read either was easy to solve as well – apparently Tony thought them to be advertising for health insurance and just threw them away… but why he did not read his salary statement which had to include information about deductions for health insurance and social security... I have no idea.

So Tony came for tech support and left as a man with comprehensive health insurance.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_czo03i,"""I don't know my own stuff....""","Preface: This \[GPS Company\] has its own GPS devices and software for updating and managing the devices \[Dock\].  


I get this lady in through chat who she says she spoke with \[GPS Company\] and was told she had something on her computer that was conflicting with the update. Of course, the moment they start spouting nonsense about the big, dangerous V, the customer takes it to heart and starts regurgitating that to me.   


I do my due diligence in getting connected to her computer, but being unfamiliar with \[GPS Company\] and it being outside my scope of support anyway, I focus on the software we provide and making sure her computer doesn't have anything on it to interfere with things. The computer is running just fine, no issues, I don't see anything she's talking about the guy from \[GPS Company\] saying, and advise she shouldn't be having any issue, but if she is, that it is likely an issue with the software itself.  


She insists on running a diagnostic scan on the computer, these scans generally take 1-2 hours, and of course I oblige with that fair warning. Scans come back with nothing really to remove and, again, the computer is pretty clean and good to go. After, to me, wasting my bloody time, I (out of irritation) asked her to start the software so I could see what's going on.  


She starts \[Dock\] and plugs in \[GPS Device\] and I notice right away that the software doesn't seem to be recognizing that \[GPS Device\] is plugged in. After telling her this, I see under File Explorer that the model the computer shows doesn't match what \[Dock\] was showing. As such, I try to verify with her what model she thinks she has.   


... she thought she had the model that is listed inside \[Dock\], but after a bit of prompting, she remembered that she has a different model (the one listed in File Explorer). . . And here's the kicker - the model that was listed in File Explorer is a Tablet model... and \[GPS Company\]'s website explicitly states that the Tablet models do not use \[Dock\] to update, but rather update going through the Tablet's settings menus.  


So TL;DR - Wasted time troubleshooting the computer when the manufacturer of the device/software having issues could've told the customer that the device she was using was incompatible with the software and she has different steps to follow to update it.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_czowy9,Occam's Razor and the Network Controller -- A Parable,"I felt like I needed to poke fun at myself for something that happened yesterday.

I was replacing a UniFi Cloud Key at our secondary site with an Ubuntu Server machine with the UniFi network controller software set up on it. The Cloud Key was a little bit underpowered to be handling captive portal, etc. Luckily, this will be an easy install. I have a fresh backup of the Cloud Key's configuration, all I have to do is put the new controller on the network and refresh from backup, change a few settings, and we'll be good to go.

Minor problem arises when I realize that the new network controller does not have the correct networking information in it. It's supposed to be set up for DHCP so I can see what free IP address it grabs, and then assign that IP address to it statically. It still has the static IP configuration from the main site where I was working on getting it set up -- forgot to change that bit. Oh well, not a huge issue. I pull out my crossover cable I keep in my bag and hook my laptop up to the server so I can SSH into it. All goes well, in a few minutes the server is all set up for DHCP.

So why isn't it pulling an address?

I spend about 30 minutes Googling. I've always dealt with the config files in /etc/network/interfaces, but Ubuntu uses netplan now, so I figured I botched that somehow. I look up from my laptop to think and my gaze rests upon the server, and on the way, my vision follows the crossover cable leading from my laptop to the server. But if the crossover cable is plugged in -- oh. So then I actually plugged the server into its switch and everything worked fine.

Yesterday I finally received the Student Account Changes Information (incoming and outgoing pupils with all new passwords and setting changes)


Part of this is a complete email password overhaul. Requesting I change almost 200 passwords for student emails in Office 365. The reason I mention Office is that it doesn't allow password Imports. Well at my level. Higher permissions can possibly use PowerShell to import.



So I created a beautiful .csv file with all the required account information as well as fields to change and sent it, with a lengthy description, (including telling them I would manually input if they couldn't import but please, please try) to the Email Masters.



They sent it back to me with no notes. I have a feeling this is going to become a ticket war.

t3_czo4xn,Email with a negative utility value,"Utility: the state of being useful, profitable, or beneficial.
In this context, anything positive, any outcome that brings you closer to something, **any** kind of gain on a universal or quantum scale.

Going straight to the story, will explain the title at the end, you'll get it better. The time of this occurance is end of August, begging of September (will be important later).

A couple days ago a colleague (Account manager - AC) replies to an email from a customer and copies my department in, as the customer is complaining about ""spam"". Too clarify if unaware, there is a difference between spam that you'd get from someone/something (spam contents and spam ""container"") and your website's contact form that is not protected against robots submitting it with spam content (spam content, legit ""container"").
And this is into a mailbox that technically doesn't even exist.

Anyway, as I was writing... AC replied, not only referring the customer to my department, but actually asking the customer if (in essence) it looks like either one or the other, and requesting to send over a couple of examples over; i.e. actually being helpful, unlike 80% of other colleagues.

A few days go by and AC forwards email from the customer (not from the customer directly to us, or as a Cc) that the customer sent ""as an example"". It goes as follows:

*Please se an example screenshot...*

What follows is a partial screenshot from webmail interface with a list of unread emails from **January to March of this year**, from page 101 out of 150. The lower three fifths of the page numbers and total number of emails are cut off, it doesn't show what the actual email address of the mailbox it is (and the closest email address that could match it has nowhere near so many emails); it shows only subjects, senders (not necessarily address) and dates.

This gives us literally nothing to go on, it's not even remotely helpful.

So here's the explanation on the title:

Customer's minuscule time spent on creating that email, the minuscule energy resources used to write the email (both the electricity to keep the computer running and biological energy the human put into writing it), the minuscule energy to transmit the message to our mailserver, the minuscule time and energy AC spent on the reply and forward and finally, the time I spent reading the email inspecting that quintessentially asinine screenshot.
All that for abso-freaking-lutely no use whatsoever, causing this entire chain of events, even with its minuscule use of general resources, it ends with a negative utility.

And of course this occurance doesn't have an ending, because it's about stupidity and spam, which are both infinite.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cz7u1x,"It's Active Directory synced, you're gonna get smacked if you do this","Was working on an issue for a user; they called in using this program called ResWare.  We're going to call this user ""Rani"".

In ResWare, they export documents and such to MS office.  This is pretty standard with pretty much any LOB programs that do reports/finances en masse.  Okay, cool, traditional problem.  Here we go, boys.

So she calls in telling me that she's having issues with opening documents in office.  It was hard enough to understand with a combination of accent and the phone being muffled, but I like a challenge so let's see.  I remote in to the machine and see the issue, office is asking for creds when logging in.  Okay, so the product is unlicensed.  Simple enough.

At this point, I had Rani log in.  No good.  Wouldn't take creds.  Well, there could be a number of reasons for this but I don't feel like digging into them so I just had her try a few more times, same result.  Okay, fine.  I see how it is.  Site uses O365 though, so let's see if they can even log into that.

So I had Rani log into this and it didn't work.  Pass or username is no good.  Ha.  So it's a password problem.  But it's never that simple.  Here it comes.  You can feel it.  I felt it as soon as I saw those dreaded red letters.

Okay, we all know passwords don't just ""stop working"", but most users don't inquire after that.  I wish it would've been that simple.

Victory, so they're using SSO.\* ""All right!  So it seems your password is synced with AD, meaning they should all be the same.  Try your computer login please.""

Rani:  i shouldn't have to do that.  The passwords have always been different.

Inner Me:  ""I'm gonna have to do it to her.  I'm REALLY gonna have to do it to her.""

Me:  ""I understand that, but as of right now your account is synced with the server.  This means that every password that is like that will be the same.  Almost like one, big, easy to use system.  Makes life much more streamlined for you.""

Rani:  ""but I never had to do this before.""

Me:  ""Let's try something..."" \*locks computer\*  ""Login for me, please.""

Rani logs in, after saying something about it.  I noticed she typed in a stupid long password.

Me:  ""What password was that?  The one you said your email pass was wasn't anywhere nearly as long as that.""

Rani:  ""Yes, because the passwords are different.""

The inner me at this point is furious like that character from Inside Out.

Me:  ""They're linked together, so let's try that.""  After she logged in, this verified her AD account wasn't locked

Pass didn't work in O365, I'm guaranteeing she half-assed it but whatever.  I'm going to beat this issue to death if it kills me.  Tried it several more times, no good.

Rani:  ""I don't know why this is taking so long.  A previous tech from last week was able to do it in 2 seconds and it worked.  I don't know why this is so difficult.""

Inner Me:  ""Okay, so you're flipping telling me a tech did this LAST WEEK and did it completely wrong, which is why we're in this boat.  I wonder who that was.""

At this point she was getting that ""you don't know what you're doing attitude"" and I wasn't about to put up with that because it wouldn't have been good for either of us.

Me:  ""Okay, you know what...""  \*goes into O365 admin\* ""I'm going to reset your password in O365 here... and it'll work.  Watch.""  \*reset pass to what she wanted, had her log in and it worked fine\* ""Now look, here's what's going to happen.  This account is going to work for an hour or two, maybe even a couple of days, BUT this system WILL sync back up to AD and your password WILL NOT WORK.  All right?""

I suspected at this point she didn't want to talk to me anymore because she wouldn't hang around to test her original issue; not being able to send files from Resware to office because her products were unlicensed.

Rani:  ""I'll call you back if there are any other issues.""

Me:  ""Mkay, here's your ticket number for if the issue reoccurs.""

I was one month into my new job, supporting Post Offices up and down the UK at Fujitsu, and yet to experience any down right stupidity when an old girl from the west country we will call Doris called through complaining that her only till wasn't working. After trying to diagnose what ""it isn't working"" means for was around 10/15 minutes, I gather that the PC unit wasn't powered on. I was frustrated that such a trivial problem took so long to diagnose, but it oughta be plain sailing from here...

90 minutes of trying to describe what the 'base' unit looked like, where it was positioned and so on began to suggest that the fucking thing wasn't there. Doris was absolutely insistent that nothing that was, ""about 6 inches wide, 18 inches tall and made of black metal/plastic with several small LED lights next to a gold power button"" existed under her counter, and more so, that she'd never had one and that her till was just ""the monitor and the keyboard"" were all she'd ever had.

Just as I was about to give up on life, this exchanged happened:

**Doris**: ""You know, I think I can see the small black thingy you're talking about my love"",  
*Vurbetan: ""fantastic, can you just see if there are any lights on, or if not, see what happens when you press the power button please?""*  
**D:** ""Oh I'm sorry, there are definitely no lights on this box. Just a silver button in the middle.""

I wasn't aware of any units with silver power buttons, but perhaps this was an older unit...

*V: ""It could be difficult to see the lights under the counter if the unit is off, are you able to press the button?""*  
**D**: ""No dear, it doesn't press in.""  
*V: ""It doesn't press in? Is it stuck? Does it look like it should press in?""*  
**D**: ""It doesn't press in. It's sticking out"".  
*V: ""It's sticking out? Does it look physically damaged?""*  
**D**: ""No no no, it looks like it's supposed to be like that.""

At this point I'm completely stumped, there's no tech there matching Doris' description of this box.

**D**: ""There are numbers.  
*V: ""Sorry, numbers? Where are they?""*  
**D**: ""On the silver thing.""

Then the computer software was upgraded. The clerk called my friend over to ask how to log out. A while later she asked if he was willing to look at the printer. The computer didn’t recognize the printer at all and needed to be reinstalled. 

A while later he went up and looked at the computer. There were a list of options. He decided to look at the manual installation list. The list was of every printer that could be installed on the current OS. The printer wasn’t on that list. 

He told the clerk that, it doesn’t look like the computer has drivers for the printer and so the printer can’t be connected to it.

The postmaster asked what is wrong. It’s so old that the current set up doesn’t have the drivers for it to work. The only way is to replace it. He shrugged saying,oh well. I was trying to replace it anyway. Now we have a good reason too.",talesfromtechsupport

Access to the room was via swipe card. Everyone who wanted a swipe card was heavily vetted. Techies had to do the cleaning as the cleaners weren't allowed in. Separate shredders. You get the picture.

One fine summer's day, HMG rock up on site to do a random inspection of the secure facilities. Afterwards, the inspector was leaning against the door casually whilst talking to the account manager when the regular fire alarm test went off, the lock clicked, and the inspector fell into the room.

Breaking something further while trying to fix it. 



This is a story about me, trying to fix something and nearly fuck up.

Disclaimer: non nativ english, on mobile, only the management approved go to in-house tech-savvy unofficial it guy


Everything started with a coworker complaining that she isn't able to send anything to the plotter. Of course this, story has to involve a printer, hasn't it?
After she left for the day, I sat down at her Desk and tried to fix, this printer issue. After some tries to get it running by fiddling around in its settings, I decide to remove the printer and it's driver to reinstall it.

Error: ""Can't do this. Resource is being used by printspooler.""

Okay, simple. Restart PC into safe mode and try it from there.

Win + r

msconfig

Entering admin credentials

Check ""Boot to safe mode minimal"" 

Reboot


PC rebooted and I tried to get to the system configuration.
As it wouldn't accept the admin credentials, it dawned to me that it wasn't the best idea, to cut the connection to the network, where the admin user was located.
I had no idea, if there was a local admin user. And as it only would reboot into safe mode, I had manage to brick this pc, 'cause without the local admin credentials I could not get back into the msconfig window. 

I was, considering my options. Declaring defeat and call our ""actuall IT guy"" to fix it, which could take from a few, hours, up to a, week or two before he would show up, or I could try to fix it my self.

I opened up Google on my pc and started searching.

I found something about registry editing via cmd which it wouldn't let me do.

And after some time and trying I read that you could change the safe mode  by getting into the system, recovery screen.

Boot - forced shutdown
Boot - forced shutdown
Wiping the sweat of my forehead
Boot - please wait - system recovery

There I clicked ""safe mode with network"", rebooted and was able to get out of safe mode eventually.


While doing this all, I remembered that the print spooler is a service, which should be listed in the task manager.

After logging in, I stopped the spooler, went to the print drivers, clicked remove and

Error: ""can't remove driver - print spooler not running""

VENDOR: ""I see the line is up and the modem uptime is 5 days, so the customer did not restart it. Since the troubleshooting was not performed, we will close this ticket.""

IFIX: ""Hold on, actually yes they did restart it, 5 days ago. the problem started a week ago. It did not solve the problem. I told you that 3 minutes ago.""

t3_cytaeg,Clone wars,"I must admit - the following happened to me and it took me ages to find the trivial solution.

At a teaching hospital, everybody had just gotten used to that newfangled computer stuff when the grown-ups decided to upgrade to a networked structure, which before the turn of the century was not really common. The network was installed, and on Day X the supplier dropped approx. 200 preconfigured PCs at the loading Dock to distribute to their designated locations. 
Being just a lowly IT support engineer, I got to do most of the physical job, whereas my more senior colleagues gathered around the PDC (primary domain controller, like a login authentication server) to greet each new machine appearing on the network with cheers.
After all the hardware was accounted for and every single PC seemed to work just fine, we even got thanked by the clinic manager.

A few days later, calls started coming in about people not being able to log into their user accounts, but there was no systematic behaviour we could pinpoint - on some days, a user at position A had a problem but his login credentials worked just fine on position B, whereas the opposite was true a few hours later. Users kept moving through the building to find computers where they could log in, quite often ending up in neighbouring departments. 

Management was not concerned, as they expected teething problems for the new systems anyway, so no systematic approach to fault isolation was requested. 

Careful plotting of the problem reports showed a pattern after some time - there were always the same clusters of computers involved. If A worked, B and C would always have the problem and vice versa. Same with D, E and F respectively. Finally it dawned on me - the supplier had preconfigured three batches of 60 odd computers each, changing the hostname between batches but not the IP (network) addresses - so whichever PC from a group of identically configured started first ""won"" as the switch would reject the others as being duplicated IP addresses.

As those were smart clients, no fancy network boot etc., the only indication was the inability to log in as the PDC was unreachable to the ""clones"". The actual fix was easy, less than a day of manually deconflicting the IP addresses  and everything was done. Supplier was sooo embarrassed...

t3_cxo17y,Customer brings backup. Backup backs the F up.,"Context: I work for a computer sales/repair store in my local area. As of the last couple of years we have also been offering repairs on most major phones like iPhones, Samsungs and more recently Huawei.

Characters:

M: Manager

C: Customer

CF: Customers Friend

(I am not a character in this story as i merely observed from the back of the store)

&amp;#x200B;

When we book in a phone for repair we ask the customer to provide us with their password so that once the repair is complete we can ensure things like the camera and spearkers are in working order. If they dont want to provide the password thats fine, we just have them sign in upon collection to let us test. This particular customer was happy to give us the password when he left his phone with us. There starts the tale.

&amp;#x200B;

So, earlier on an average Tuesday shift we had repaired a customers iPhone screen (7 iirc) and they had since collected and paid for it.  A few hours later, the customer, a lad of about 17 i would guess, comes back in to the shop, this time accompanied by a female friend.

&amp;#x200B;

My manager recognises the customer.

M: ""Hi, is everything OK with the phone?""

C: ""Actually, i am having an issue with unlocking my phone, i am entering my password but its keeps saying its incorrect, now its locked for 15 minutes""

As soon as the customer finishes his sentence, it happens. The female friend (Also about 17) slams her palms onto the counter and snarls at my manager.

CF: ""It's because you've changed the f---ing password!""

Total silence while my manager takes in what she has just said, then he addresses the boy.

M: ""It is likely that you are just entering the password wrong, but if you have all of the details we can help you reset your phone if you are certain you are entering the password correctly. Also, we would never change your password, we have no reason to, we only use it to ensure the work is completed correctly and it is not worth our reputation as a business to misuse your information""

&amp;#x200B;

My manager then turns to the girl.

M: ""As for you......YOU CAN GET THE F OUT OF MY SHOP RIGHT NOW!""

The girl looks so stunned i think she might be about to break into tears.

CF: ""You cant speak to me like that i'm only 17!""

M: ""Just did....BYE!""

The girl, clearly out of her depth actually just turns around and leaves. The boy scoops up his phone and quickly follows, apparently forgetting about his problem. We then hear the girl talking about how my manger is ""Lucky i dont spark his lights out right now"". All of the staff burst out laughing.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day the boy returns, this time with his grandfather. We then learnt that the boy HAD infact been entering his passcode wrong and that the phone was fully functional. However the grandfather was here to complain about how we had spoken to his grandson and his friend. Young lad looked pretty smug until my manager explained the situation from the previous day.

&amp;#x200B;

Immediate 180 from the old guy, apologised for his grandsons behaviour and assured us the girls parents would be notified of her actions as well. My manager assures him its no problem and he bears no ill will.

Grandfather and Grandson leave the shop together, Grandfather wearing the face of a man about to explode and the Grandson wearing the face of a boy who knows that explosion is going to be directed at him.

t3_cxr4qw,Calls forward to voicemail after three rings,"Your intrepid contract field service tech goes out for another service call today. Issue: “restore primary internet connection”. It’s 100 miles from home at a restaurant in a major US city. 

That turns out to be simple. The broadband provider Ethernet cable is unplugged from the modem. But it’s complicated by the fact that our MSP (my customer) hasn’t recorded that we updated the solution on site a few months from a brand “C” router and VoIP provider #1 to a brand “F” UTM device and switch and VoIP provider #2’s service/equipment. That eventually gets sorted out (I sent the support line a photo to prove that the new equipment was there). 

The manager mentioned that since the phones were replaced, they don’t have time to pick up before it stops ringing. The phones are a VoIP DECT system. One base station, up to four handsets. 

Site is configured with a main number that has an auto-attendant that is supposed to transfer to a busy message or some such if they’re too busy to answer after nine rings, but it isn’t going anywhere near that long. 

It turns out that the base station has its own internal logic for call handling. The base station was provisioned with a “call forward no answer” rule and timeout of 18 seconds, which was just about enough to emit three rings before forwarding to VM using its internal rule. 

We adjusted that to the max of 120 seconds, so the auto-attendant’s rule prevails. I would argue that 40 or so seconds still isn’t long enough, but it’s twice what they were getting.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_cxpb3v,It's not network-related.,"So my company deals with web software, you can install it on a VM or HyperV or Azure or whatever. 

Customer calls in, ""Hey, we can't get to the server. The website is down.""

I check. Website is up, but a bit slow. 

Me: ""Huh, looks like it's still up for me. Maybe this is a local problem. Can you get to other websites?""

Them: ""No it's the server, it's down. No one else in the office can get there"". 

I was working from home, so I use my work laptop to VPN into the office and check through that. Sure enough, no website comes up. 

Me: ""Huh, this seems like a weird network problem. You should talk to your network guys and see if they can resolve this. I'll keep the ticket open.."" blah blah blah

30 minutes later, the call in, they have an Azure dude (they're hosted in Azure), a network dude, and the administrator. 

Them: ""It's not network related. I get a login prompt when I SSH to the server. That means it's not network related""

I check some things out, and so do they. We determine that it's a 50/50 shot of the website being able to load, but if it doesn't load on a specific machine, it's consistent. Unless they change the network the machine is on, it will consistently either not load, or consistently load. 

So, obviously, this is pretty weird, but I can't imagine any universe where it is the server. 

Eventually, they find a server within the network, and I ask them to load the admin interface to see resource usage. 

Surprisingly, they can. Everything is running. All the services are go. The CPU usage is nominal. Ram is fine. Storage is running low, so they add half a terabyte in Azure. Other than that, it's fine. 

Me: ""So this is really looking like a network issue""

Them: ""This is 100 percent NOT a network issue! Yell scream scream!""

I try to ask probing questions to figure out how they think it could be a server issue (I don't fix networks, I fix servers, the customers network is none of my business). They're evasive. They mention F5 load balancers but assure me ""It's not that"". They think it could be NTP, and try to debug the NTP server in their domain until I point out that the server uses pool.ntp.org and that the time is correct. They troubleshoot everything except the network. I try to zone out of the situation and work on something else while still on the phone with them, but they keep trying to wrap me back in even after it's pretty much 10,000 percent confirmed it was the network. They demand I get into the backend and poke around. 

Services are fine. Everything is fine. Server is fine. 

I hand it over to the later crew, even though this is definitely not our problem, but keep an eye on chat just because I'm curious how this goes. 

At the end of it all:

1: They are using the company's static IP as the a-record for the domain

2: Requests made to the static IP are NAT'd to Azure 

3: They get there through a VPN

No TLDR because I think this story is worth the read.

This took place in the early 90s, and I was the head of a two-person computer department. The company was a boutique management consulting firm with many of our clients being the middle management and C-suite executives for a considerable number of the Fortune 500 firms.

We had a decent computer system setup in those days. A bevy of Macs for the graphics department making the presentation slides for the consultants, and 8-10 PCs in a dedicated room for number crunching. This was a few years before a Cat-5 run to each desk was commonplace, so a central computer room was pretty much the norm for a professional services firm.

While my primary responsibilities were for the PCs and my #2 (hereafter MacDude) was responsible for the Macs, there was one system that was largely left to its own devices with minimal intervention; the AT&amp;T Unix-based PBX in the phone closet. We had about 75-100 people in that location and had acquired the system when moving into that space. I'm pretty sure it was leased, as that's how AT&amp;T worked back then, but billing was never my strong suit, so I didn't pay much attention to such details. Whenever I got an email telling me an AT&amp;T tech was coming in to perform an upgrade or some such, I'd meet them in reception and walk them over to the phone closet and let them do their thing. Once or twice we'd had some urgent issues, and I had called AT&amp;T tech support and they'd walked me through logging in at the console and checking some stuff, so at least I knew the customer admin password and could login if needed.

So one day I'm sitting at my desk, probably programming HyperCard to update the phone directory, when our Comptroller Guy (Compie) walks in holding that month's phone bill.

""Hey Jack, do you know anything about the phone system?""

""I know how to make a call and answer a call. What would *you* need beyond that?""

""Funny. Can you tell me who made a specific phone call?""

""Maybe. The PBX has a console and I can probably figure something out. Let's go take a look.""

So, we wander over to the phone closet and I log in. I spend a few minutes exploring menus and eventually find the reporting system. It's actually pretty straight-forward, and I take the number from Compie and enter it into the search field.

""Yeah, it looks like it was called about 12 times from these three extensions.""

""Whose extensions are those?""

""Let's see... looks like Conference Rooms 6, 8 and 11.""

""So there's no way to to tell who called that number?""

""Not unless there are video cameras that I don't know about.""

""Okay... thanks.""

""Why are you asking?""

""I can't tell you.""

Even as early as that in my career, I knew when not to pry. ""Okay, let me know if you need anything else.""

I think two or three months went by before Compie was back at my desk.

""Hey, Jack; can we go look at the call log again?""

""Sure, which number this time?""

""Same one and two others.""

He gave them to me and back we went.

""Looks like a total of 43 times in the past three months.""

""Damn it. What the hell?!""

I looked at Compie. Normally a pretty laid back guy, he was genuinely upset.

""What's going on?""

""Let me go ask Dave if I can tell you. I'll be right back.""

Dave was the president (and one of four founders) of the firm and my boss. If he was involved and making Compie keep it quiet, there was something serious going on. Five minutes later, Compie comes back, closes us into the phone closet and tells me to dial one of the numbers on speakerphone.

""&lt;Hey there, are you making plans for the weekend?  Well, I can't wait to tell you just how hot the weather is going to be.&gt;"" As the intro spiel goes on, I look up at Compie with my jaw gaping open.

""Someone's calling a &lt;Weather Service&gt;? We have a block on &lt;WS&gt; numbers.""

""But it's not a &lt;WS&gt; number in the US; it's somewhere in the Caribbean."" Compie shows me the phone bill. Sure enough, the call detail listed the various call destinations as being in Costa Rica, Honduras and, if I recall correctly, the Dominican Republic.

""Huh.""

""He's been doing it for three months now.""

""And charging it to the firm?""

""No, the calls are only for a minute, and that's how long their introduction is. It's the long distance charges that are starting to pile up.""

Sure enough, the call detail log showed that all calls to a specific number were all the same duration, roughly a minute.

""Dave wants this person tracked down. Can you do it?""

""Yeah, sure. Give me a bit to look up all the source extensions.""

But every single one was from a conference room (except for a few from Compie's line obviously). This guy knew to cover his tracks. Reluctantly I told Compie no luck.

This went on for months. Every month Compie would bring me the new phone bill log so that I could note the new numbers being used. The guy started out fairly modestly (compared to later), but as time went on, he seemed to get emboldened by his getting away with it. The calls became more frequent, and he got to the point where he would hang up and call the same &lt;Weather Service&gt; multiple times in a row. I think his record was one number 15 times in a row. And there was no pattern to it, other than always being from a conference room phone. Not once did he slip up and call one of the numbers from his desk phone. Another thing that puzzled us was that there would be days where dozens of calls were made, but none on the next day or the day before. It seemed totally random.

It took so long to find out who he was that we discovered that the PBX only stored a month or two of log data (hard drives were expensive back then), so I had to figure out how to export the records to a floppy disk and save them on my computer. I used FileMaker Pro to store the data and later used it to analyze the records.*

After nine months of this, Dave was not happy. One of the few times we discussed it he told me his biggest concern. ""Jack, if I knew this was absolutely confined to calls made from this office, I'd be less concerned. But I am going to be pissed if this is a consultant and he's making these calls at the client. The last thing I need is a CEO asking me why my consultants are calling &lt;Weather Services&gt; from his office.""

""The days when there aren't any calls made here; I hadn't thought of that.""

""That was the first thing that occured to me when I saw those gaps."" There was a reason he was the boss.

""Okay Boss, we'll figure it out.""

And we did. Once the light bulb went off for how we would catch him.

If he never called a &lt;Weather Service&gt; from his desk, maybe we could tie him to calling a different number that no one else in the firm ever called.

And that *was* how we caught him.

One thing we knew about conference rooms is that they were in short supply and it was not uncommon for calls to run over and the next person/team to be knocking on the glass wall pointing at their watch(es) to indicate to the occupants that their time slot was up and they needed to vacate the room for the next team to use it. We actually watched and timed multiples times how long it took for a call to end and the people inside to pack up and leave and the next call to start.

We settled on a maximum gap between calls of 8 seconds. Any longer than that, we couldn't assume the call was made by the same person.

While this methodology certainly cast our net wider, all the numbers that we could positively tie to having been dialed by the same guy were either client main numbers or local businesses, etc., that were also called from many personal desk phones throughout the firm. We were beginning to think he would never slip up.

But, like all bad guys, he eventually did. I think it was a year after Compie first came to me that we hit paydirt. Two calls to a local &lt;meteorologist's clothing store&gt; with a &lt;humid&gt; message on the answering machine in the same month, one from a conference room tied to a &lt;Weather Service&gt; call, and one from a personal desk line. Once we had a suspect, we knew what we had to do, as we had spent a good amount of time over the months brainstorming how to verify who the culprit was.

I would try to visually verify that this guy was in a conference room while a &lt;Weather Service&gt; call was being made. If I recall correctly, I could flag a number and have the system send a notification to me once a call to a specific number had ended. But I think I was limited to a set number of numbers to monitor, so I was guessing if he would stick to the current crop of numbers or being trying out new ones this month. I would get a notification, run to the phone closet, run the search to figure out the conference room, run to the conference room to see who was in there, and then run back to verify another &lt;Weather Service&gt; was called during my running around. It took me a week to visually verify that it was the guy we thought it was.

MacDude, a *really* laid back guy and very non-confrontational decided that he would try to prove innocence, because he didn't want it to become a witch hunt. He went to Compie and requested all the guy's timesheets, trying to see if any call was ever made while when the guy had in his timesheets that he was at a client. Ironically, this was the nail in the coffin for the guy. The timesheets and the call logs lined up perfectly. Not once was a &lt;Weather Service&gt; line called when the guy was at the client.

It turned out we both finished on the same day. We compared notes, agreed we were right, and went to Dave's office.

""Hi Dave, thanks for seeing us on such short notice. We know who it is; it's GQ**. We can walk you through the proof if you want.""

""Are you absolutely sure?""

""No question. It's GQ.""

""Okay, I'll handle it from here. Tell no one about this.""

And that was it.

About three or four weeks later, that standard exit email went out from GQ: ""Thanks for the memories and good luck in your future"". It seemed that GQ had decided it was time to move on to greener pastures and was taking a position with a different company in one of Boston's suburbs.

But, man, I wish I had been able to be a fly on the wall when Dave confronted GQ. As Dave was ex-military, it would have been an epic dressing down.

-=-=-

\* God I miss FileMaker Pro; what a great little personal database app.

\*\* Why did i use GQ? This was also one of the big puzzlers to us. GQ was just that; a guy who could very well have been on the cover of GQ. Very attractive, one of the sharpest dressers I've ever known (French cuffs/cuff links and matching collar pin every day, the primary shirt color matching tie and pin-striping, the whole ensemble clearly from a high-end men's fashion shop), hair and beard meticulously maintained, a genuinely good guy who never treated the support staff badly. And he was literally married to a &lt;meterologist&gt;. A smoking-hot, regionally-known &lt;meterologist&gt;.

Yet he was compelled, obsessively so, to call these &lt;Weather Service&gt; lines.

I haven't checked on him in years. I hope he found help and ended up in a good place.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cxngui,Psychic software,"I work in a financial services company, where we write custom software for vehicle loan/lease origination. There are in-house customer support reps, who deal directly with the end users (auto dealers). When they find a problem in the software they enter a ticket and here is where I come in.

\-------------------------------------

TS == Ticket from user in customer support.

TS : (paraphrased) Dealer called to say that the sales tax was incorrect, and it wasn't letting them enter a different amount (it was zero).

Me: I open the application, and look at the customer address, and they are in Oregon. I google ""sales tax in Oregon"" to get a clue as to why it might be zero, and it says there is zero sales tax (go Oregon!). I reply to the ticket saying that they are in a state where it's zero, and it's not supposed to be editable.

TS: But the customer lives in New Mexico! It's not zero in New Mexico, I looked it up.

Me: .... The address entered is in Oregon. If they enter an address in New Mexico, it'll calculate the tax for New Mexico.

TS: Well, their address is in Oregon, but they LIVE (they capitalized it) in New Mexico!

Me: ... There are two options, change the address to one in New Mexico, or move forward with the Oregon address with the appropriate sales tax.

I get that the customer support reps get frazzled if they get in irate dealer on the line, but  as hard as I try, I have yet to make my software psychic.

I  apologized for the communication issues and just let her know if it happens again, to keep an eye on the status bar on the bottom of the outlook app, and to try toggling off the Work Offline button again.  Also, recommended she calls or comes directly to the help desk if more problems occur.

t3_cxebit,The Short Tale of the Disappearing Emails,"Another day as a tech support. We have had some newbies coming in for level 1 for a few weeks now. One ticket came in as stated below.

&gt;Issue : Random emails keep missing from $User's mailbox.   
&gt;  
&gt;T/s done : New ost created, new profile created, run as safe mode, crosschecked on OWA, repaired and reinstalled Outlook  
&gt;  
&gt;Issue stated : Unknown. $User just realized that she has been missing the emails when a colleague ask her why didn't she replied. Since then $user has been noticing even newer emails gets missing.

Upon checking the ticket, ticket has been touched by numerous agents from different teams before landing in my bin. 

Complaint ticket has been made since it has breached our SLA. User was really unhappy. (sigh, here we go again)

$Me : Hi $User, I'm calling in regards of your ticket Tix123456. For the missing emails issue, if you have a moment right now, may I remote in and take a look and find the emails.

$User : Hi there, finally. Hopefully you can try better than the rest before you. Look, I don't want my profile to be recreated anymore. Last time the guy did it, it took me hours just to get my whole mailbox back. And just so you know, they already reinstalled my Outlook a few times. All of that didn't work. All of that just wasted hours of my time.

$Me : I understand and I will try my best not to repeat the same steps as before. Please save and close down all important documents before I remote in.

$User : Yeah yeah, go on. Just to be clear, the missing emails are not only from a specific sender. It's like it has a mind of it's own. I can confirm that the emails missing, one of them is regarding a party we're about to throw for our mate's birthday. The other one, its about working forms.

&gt;After getting connected, I opened up Outlook and the first thing I noticed is that $user had hundreds of sub, sub-folders etc. Pretty sure it must've gone in one of those. 

$Me : Can you show me some examples of an email that you are sure it's missing. You can ask your colleague to forward it to you but you will need to rename the subject. 

&gt;$User proceed to talk to the colleagues that's sitting next to $user and asking to forward some emails while trash talking about IT. It went something like this; ""*Hey, I'm on the phone with one of the IT people again. I don't think she knows what shes doing. She had been clicking here and there and now she wants one of you to forward the email that was missing from my mailbox.""*  I couldn't hear the rest of the conversation, but I heard the tone on how the all laughed. 

$User : Hey, how many emails do you want? My colleague already sent one, and I don't see it still in the inbox.

$Me : 3 should be sufficient. Please change the subject of the email.

$User : But she did. Don't you think we already tried this multiple times? The same missing emails will never show up.

$Me : Okay. Please ask your colleague to put ""Test"" as the subject.

&gt;""*What is this girl trying to do? We've done it a dozens time. Babe, can you send it again with the subject  ""test""?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Ding! The email came in. I scrolled down the see the previous subject : ""Forms to resubmit""

$Me : Great, now do the same with 2 more different emails.

&gt;Ding! 2nd email previous subject : ""Outfit Reminder for $colleague's Party""  
&gt;  
&gt;Ding! 3rd email previous subject : ""Fwd : $Company Pvt Limited : $InvoiceTitle""  
&gt;  
&gt;Took me 2 minutes to realized the similarity in those emails. 

$User : You know those are private. You shouldn't be reading those.

$Me : Im just trying to understand the situation. 

&gt;Queue laughing and whispering with snarky tones.  
&gt;  
&gt;As much as I would love to end the call without solving the issue and leave the user to suffer longer, but I'm one of those people who hates having a ticket staring at me in my bin.  
&gt;  
&gt;Proceeded to open Rules, lo and behold;  
&gt;  
&gt;""If the messages includes specific word in the subject ""IT"", move the message to folder ""IT Stuff""  
&gt;  
&gt;Located the folder, it was in sub-sub-sub folder way out of site

&gt;Silence commerce. 

$Me : All the missing emails you can find it in the IT Stuff folder. I will remove this rule for now. I will also be closing this ticket. Have a nice day.

t3_cxguxo,I don't want to do that.....,"TL;DR

Developer with a little knowledge of sysadmin wanted me to clone another machine to fix a problem instead of adding code that would give me the information needed to fix the problem.

Back story: I was a Windows programmer in the days of ""n-tier"" and ""R.A.D."" I did Java/DB and VB/DB work. I hated it so I became a Linux sysadmin instead. I've been a Linux sysadmin now for about 20 years.

Now I'm a Senior Linux sysadmin for an unnamed contracting company in an unnamed city. One of my jobs is to help developers diagnose problems with their applications.

On one of the teams the lead is a very quiet, very polite lady that does Java/Tomcat development. One day she comes to me after an application stops accepting uploads.

Me: Ok, I'll tail the logs, you try the upload.

Dev: \[does so\]

Me: Ok, I see the error, but it is really vague. (It's just a generic java error about a particular module)

Dev: Well, you can see it doing the same thing on my local. (English is not her first language.)

Me: I understand, but that is the same error. I need more information before I can troubleshoot the error. Not to mention that your laptop is a Windows 10 machine and the QA server is a Linux box. (I wish the company would get the developers to do their development work on a Linux machine, but I suppose that would mean training them and having to support it, but on the other hand....)

Dev: But its the same error on my local.

Me: I know, but before I can diagnose, I need more information. Try adding a statement to do this. \[I describe the idea\]

Dev: \[makes some minor changes that are not what I suggested and runs it on her laptop\] See, there is the problem!

Me: Again, this is a Windows laptop and the server is a Linux box. I \*need\* more specific information from the Linux box itself, not your Windows laptop. Please, add the appropriate logging code.

Dev: Um.... I don't want to do that because it will generate a Jira ticket.

Me: (Internal Facepalm) Um... Ok, but I can't diagnose it without more detailed information. ( She doesn't want to do the work to fix the problem because it will generate a ticket in the ticketing system that tracks bug fixes and new feature development.... huh? )

Dev: Can you check the permissions? (Often, the problem is just a simple permissions issue. The developers know this, and it's their first line of questioning when something breaks. However, I have already done this.)

Me: I checked the permissions before you came over. They are what they are supposed to be.

Dev: Could you check again?

Me: Sure. (Internal eyeroll. I do the appropriate commands to set the permissions in full view of the developer, and kindly and patiently show her the results. I check SELinux just to be sure. It's in permissive mode.)

Dev: Ok, Let me try...... No... still broken.

Me: As a test, I'll run the application as root. (This is a bad idea, but it will prove the permissions aren't the problem)

Dev: I'll try.... no... still broken.

Me: Well, it's not a permissions issue. The application is running as root.

Dev: But it's not working.

Me: I understand, but root has access to \*everything.\* It's not a permissions issue.

Dev: Can you check the permissions again?

Me: The permissions aren't the issue. They were correct before we started and now the application is running as root.

Dev: Well, can you clone the staging machine, which is working?

Me: (Internal Facepalm!!! At one point we had a problem with a server and after checking everything to the smallest detail, like settings for each application, permissions, boot settings, a partridge in a pear tree and also checking the settings between the broken machine and the working staging machine. we solved it by cloning the working staging machine. I wish the developers didn't know we could do this! )

Me: Um, no. The SAN that holds the VM Image is nearly full. There isn't enough space.

Dev: Well, it's this on my local.

Me: I understand, but that is a Windows box, and I need to see more detailed information...........

After going round and round like this for a couple more minutes, she leaves, defeated. I haven't heard back from her. I don't know what the resolution was. Since the problem affected one of the core functions of their application, it would be a major problem for them to not be able to test it. I would be very surprised if they left it broken. I can only assume that they found that it was a code problem and fixed it and didn't tell me. Also, if they had gone to my boss and he fixed it, I would have heard about it.

What frustrates me most is that I don't come to their desks and dictate code to them. I \*barely ever\* suggest anything like logging code. Ugh....",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cxc30k,The higher-ups backed me when I told this User off...,"Sorry for the length and formatting; been a really long day.-------------------------------Ever had a user get unreasonably angry and start screaming at you? Well, here's one of mine:

My job at the time was still using Office 2011 on Windows 7 and it was already outdated. There was a bug where local pst files would get too large and Outlook would just... die; the whole machine would lock up until you killed outlook. The issue was, it would kill the program, but the process would remain 'running' and be locked up completely. Reopening outlook without rebooting the machine would only lead to the machine locking up and nothing responding at all. Solution at that point was only to reboot.

We'll call the user ""Bob""

Bob calls down to my desk-

Me: ""Hey Bob, what can I do for you?""Bob: ""You need to fix this computer. It's acting up and won't let me do anything.""Me: Sure; I take it you're not able to put in a ticket. Let me head on up and I'll take a look.""

I head up and step inside Bob's cubicle, immediately seeing the issue described above.

Me: ""Hey, Bob... I know you hate hearing this but I can see what's going on right now; your Outlook is acting up again and you're going to need to restart.""

Bob goes nuts: ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN I HAVE TO RESTART!? RESTART! RESTART! THAT'S ALL YOU EVER SAY! WHY CAN'T YOU JUST FIX THIS ISSUE THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE TO RESTART ALL THE D&amp;$N TIME!?"" (caps because he's actually screaming this right outside the executive director's office)

Me: ""Look, I know you hate it but unfortunately until I can convince \[my boss\] to let me purchase new licenses to upgrade everyone or let me change everyone to server-side storage, there isn't another fix to this particular issue.""

Bob: ""THAT'S JUST GREAT. WHAT THE F\*$( DO YOU EVEN DO HERE, HUH!?""

I cut him off: ""Look, my job is to make sure that our infrastructure and user machines are working and to fix what I can when they aren't. My job is *NOT* to be screamed at and treated this way. Either you calm down and we can get you back up and running or I can leave now and come back when you're done acting like a child.""

Bob: ""WHATEVER! JUST GO; YOU'RE USELESS ANYWAY! GET OUT OF HERE I'LL DO IT MYSELF!""

So I left; the executive director had been standing in her doorway around the corner and heard the whole thing. She just looked at me in disbelief that Bob lost it at me like that but later pulled me into her office to make sure I was alright and apologize.

I made it back to IT's section, told my boss exactly what happened (with the DBA listening in). Bob called down to my boss and she cut him off saying she backed my decision and agreed with me. Bob hung up angrily and then called the DBA to complain about me. DBA told him he was a moron and ripped into him about how he was handling everything. I was outside the DBA's office at my desk and heard Bob slam his phone from DBA's receiver. Bob ""took a year off"" after that and then quit before the year was up.

Edit: right, so a number of you have pointed out that I've been working in a Mac-only environment for way too long (last 3 years). Y'all are right that 2011 was Mac's version and I misremembered the version (we've all had those moments or will haha). Must have been 2010 because my boss didn't anything later.

Also, some people have said support was subpar because task manager and powershell should have been used to close the process: i thought (late at night) that I'd explained the issue; the problem was that the pst file size would, for some reason, cause the process to lock and neither task manager not powershell would actually kill the process itself (these were first checks when the users would try to reopen Outlook only to get an endless ""loading"" or whatever the big Outlook-Yellow box said)

t3_cxebdr,My first 'in memory' database,"In 1998 I was seconded from my job as Oracle DBA to be BASIS (system) administrator for the SAP system that my company was implementing.  To prepare me for my new Role I was sent on all of the relevant SAP courses and a Unix system administrator course.

The company had a Unix 'guru' who had supported some of the systems that had been superseded by SAP.  He helped me while I was bringing myself up to speed with my new responsibilities.

One day the guru sent me a shell script to perform some housekeeping.  It was meant to start in a directory and delete anything in that directory or the subdirectories which was over 30 days old.  Simples.

**The  bad news**


The problem was that the start directory, which existed in the DEV and QA systems, did not exist in the PRD system, which had multiple application servers and used shared filesystems.

The script was unable to find its start point so started from **root** and searched for 'old' files in the whole tree.  The script was being run by the **root** user so had sufficient privilege to delete anything it found.  Perfect storm.

The Unix kernel and the Oracle/SAP executables were all date stamped with their installation dates.  Gone !!

**The good news**

This was when I found out how awesome Unix, Oracle and SAP were.  The kernel and the Oracle/SAP executables were all loaded into RAM on startup and, under normal operating conditions, did not need to be reloaded from disk.  Everything was running in memory, with data being read from and written to datafiles and logs which were in constant use and, consequentially, hadn't been touched by the script.
The other good news was that we had several layers of redundancy in the system.  The application had two central instance nodes.  Both nodes contained the same kernel and full sets of executables.
It took almost a week of long days but we were able to copy all of the deleted files from the standby node to the active node.  Verifying that nothing had been missed was a real nightmare but Oracle/SAP never even blinked and no endusers were aware of how close we had been to disaster.

**Aftermath**

The Unix 'guru' was never allowed to touch our SAP servers again and I learned a valuable lesson for writing future scripts - check which directory you are in before issuing a command !!",talesfromtechsupport

t3_cxa9bf,"Can't call when the phones are down, and that's my fault, is it?","About 8 years ago, I was doing IT Support for a Japanese car manufacturer in the UK.  One day, the computerised phone system broke; it was an external issue, so there was nothing we could do. So we updated the companies intranet page to say don't bother calling, it'll just ring and not connect.  For three glorious hours, not one single call; I cleared out my backlog, dealt with a few emails, and generally had a chilled afternoon.  

Sadly, all good things must come to an end. 

The first call I took went like this. 

Caller *huffing and puffing*: What's going on, I've been trying to get through for the last two hours!  

*Trying to get ahead of his anger and diffuse it*

Me: Our phone system has been down, did you not see the alert on the intranet page?

C: Er, yes, but I didn't think you were part of &lt;company&gt;!

M: You didn't think that the &lt;company&gt; IT Service Desk was part of &lt;company&gt;?

C: Yes!

M: OK, well for future reference, the &lt;company&gt; IT Service Desk is part of &lt;company&gt;. We're located in the &lt;company&gt; head office building.

C paused for a bit, then took on a combative tone.

C: You know! Update the phones to say they're not working!

t3_cx195d,When someone blatantly lies to you,"In my previous posts I talked about working as Tech support for an ISP. But a couple of months ago I got a job at a service desk for government works. Overall much better job. Like waaaay better. But every now and then I still get some interesting calls. 

I talked to a user and informed her that since we had tried everything we could try over the phone, I needed to send an on site technician.   
She asked for her case to be prioritized.   
I informed her that I can't promise that.   
She declared that it *needs* to be prioritized. Because she had called us ""several times"" about this (she had called twice). And here is the kicker. According to her *every time* she calls us, there is always such a long queue. ""It's always have to wait like half an hour just to talk to a human and not some computer"".

Now this sounded all kinds of weird to me. First of all, the only computer message we use is ""Welcome to \[company\] service desk. If you errand is about \[stuff\] Press 1... etc.""  
The second thing that was weird was the waiting time. Let me tell you. One of the reasons I love my new job is that most days we get a 5 - 10 minute wait between calls. We very rarely have even a 2 minute wait for users. In our contract it says that we need to answer all calls within 30 seconds, that is known as an SLA (Service Level Agreement). If the SLA falls below 90% the company pays a hefty fine. If it goes below 80%, the fine gets worse. 

Our SLA for the month of August, is 97,3%. The only queue we had was one day when all the schools started again and every single teacher needed a new password. But that was one day. And the queues were at most 5 minutes. Before that day, since all schools were out (and schools are most of our business), we easily had 20 - 30 minute waits between calls. We had waits so long my coworkers and I brought Switches to play smash against each other between calls. So to claim that ""every time she calls she has to wait"" is just impossible.

I asked the user if she had to wait in a queue for this call.   
She said yes.  
I asked for how long.   
She said easily 5 minutes.  
So I, with a smug smile, informed her when she called I had been next in line for a call for 4 minutes. Out of 16 available agents, 9 were free (I was number 10 until the call came in). So if she had to wait in a queue for this call, she should probably look in to if her phone is broken and has issues connecting calls.  
She started to backpedal and said ""Well maybe not this time. But several other times.""  
Trying not to laugh about the very obvious backpedal and I asked her when she last had an half an hour wait.   
Guess what? She gave me a date that came before the schools started. I pointed that out as well, and informed her of the long wait times between calls. And again I pointed to her phone as the likely culprit.  
She got flustered, pretty clearly annoyed about her lie not working, and just told me to ""send the damn technician"".   
I obliged.

I mean honestly. Why would anyone think a lie like that would work? Doesn't she realize that we, if anyone, are aware of the queue status? We get briefed each week about our SLA. And the numbers are clearly displayed on a white board when we get to the office. I have enough time between two calls to write everything above this paragraph. 

I heard a bunch obvious lies and excuses when I worked for an ISP. But this was the first time someone tried to lie to me about something I don't even need to lookup to see if it was false. I just knew it was complete bull right away. This was just stupid.",talesfromtechsupport

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of background information beforehand:

Back in the 1990s - the dinosaurs here will remember the days, when everything was so much simpler... - I had a nice job with a branch of a big banking / real estate company in Hamburg (Germany), 70km from where I studied at university. Basically, I was required to come in one afternoon a week to take care of any problems the users (all 20 of them) might have encountered in the meantime, check the backup tapes etc. - and most of the time there was really nothing difficult to do. As they didn't do any cash transactions or the ""usual"" banking stuff but only long term investment and real estate deals, transactions were usually not time critical but involved huge numbers (want to guess what successfully marketing 12 whole office floors within the then-new Sony Center at Berlin Potsdamer Platz, real prime location in the German capital, netted the company and the managers involved?)

What made this job special were three advantages I never encountered again anywhere else.

1. The clock started when I left my apartment to travel to work and stopped when I returned there, unless I decided not to go directly and was allowed to put in a hypothetical amount of travel time on the time sheet. They even covered the cost of public transport to and from work... apparently my predecessor had had that deal with them and they never changed it. So, without lifting a single finger doing anything productive, I always earned at least 4hrs wages + travel expenses (again, not for ""business travel"" but just commuting) just by deciding to show up. Nice. But then again, to them it was ""peanuts"". Usually, this worked out to my advantage - I tailored my working days to fit my university lecture schedule, so it was more or less a paid trip to town, work as long as I wanted (or the wallet / bank account needed) and leave in time to enjoy the evening.
2. I got paid a ridiculous amount of money for stupid tasks. Although I did study computer sciences at university at the time and had even gone the extra mile to get my MCSE (Windows NT 4.0 and SQL Server 5.?, long since expired), this didn't have much to do with the day to day work in  a Novell Netware 3.12 / Windows NT 4.0 environment, dealing with everything from printer stoppages, missing paper, stuck tapes and Windows profile setup to scanner issues... I got paid 40 Deutsche Mark / hour, which translated (exchange rate from 1997) to US$27 / hour and, taking 20+ years of inflation into account, maybe double that in today's value. No degree (yet), no formal training, some self-taught skills and plenty of trust in my abilities and honesty...
3. I was, although nerdy / shy, the most popular guy in the local branch. For the secretaries (btw, back then they were picked more for looks than for ability, which made my work both fun and frustrating), I was the only male who was not openly ""superior"" in the company hierarchy and rubbing their noses in it, and I didn't expect them to go to bed with me to ""celebrate"" especially successful business deals. For the sales department, I was the guy who could, with a bit of ""witchcraft"", create fantastic presentation folders and slide shows for their real estate projects. For the legal department, their outlook and mine were closely aligned vis-a-vis data confidentiality and the importance of reliable backups. And the branch manager somehow had the impression they were exploiting me and so he got me to tag along when they went out to celebrate... (blowing just 1% of a RE deal bonus payment on food and liquor can take surprisingly long). During all my time there, I never had to go get my own cup of tea (it always appeared mysteriously at my elbow, white, one sugar, usually accompanied by the secretary with subjectively the most urgent problems) - something the girls flat out refused to do for anybody else - never had trouble accessing any computer even if the really important people in charge were usually reluctant to let anybody interrupt their work, and once even got the branch manager's beamer (a really nice BMW 840 or 850) to take home over the weekend because I had missed the last direct train and he didn't want me to have to wait for a connection...

All in all, people there were strange, friendly, earned ridiculous amounts of money, and usually we got along splendidly. But there are some tales that are too good not to tell...

&amp;#x200B;

The Cast:

* me - obviously me, the part-time IT guy...
* SR - one of our hot shot sales reps, in his 40s - one of the guys who can sell water to a fish and make them feel they got the better end of the deal, unless you got to know him (think used car salesman, but on a huge scale with business deals in the millions), and usually a good guy unless under pressure
* BM - branch manager, with a keen sense of self preservation

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, it's the 90s, so internet, e-mail etc. were rather basic compared to today and vaguely frightening to the older colleagues. It was a Saturday, which is not considered to be a normal working day in Germany, so nearly all shops were closed (back then, retail shops were usually open only before noon on Saturdays, not at all on Sundays).

Enter SR, calling me at home from his mobile phone (btw, hugely expensive back then, like $1,50/minute) to tell me he needed support, pronto, because obviously I had not fixed his problem the week before and he needed to prepare a slideshow for an investors' meeting that very evening. I racked my brain about any unfinished business, but couldn't remember any critical issues or any issues at all related to SR's computer... As I presumed it was more of a layer 8 issue - he was good at selling, but not at dealing with technology - I tried to get more information than just ""my computer won't start"", until finally he admitted he had moved the computer around in his office and as the cable wasn't long enough from the new location he had exchanged the network port for the similar looking telephone port (both RJ45, but one ways hooked up to the data switch and the other one to the telephone system) and vice versa, which nicely explained the conversation we had using his mobile phone, running up a decent bill... and when asked to undo his changes, he flat out refused to do it because he was not (in his words) ""a janitor"", and no, he needed his normal computer to do the work, using another one was absolutely impossible. He had had that situation since the previous Monday but hat worked externally for a few days without telling anybody about his problem - and a problem we don't know about, we can't fix, which would have been really easy.

So he wanted me to come in extra, which was not covered in my contract, and told me he would square it with BM. Knowing SR, his promises are only worth anything as long as he needs you, I insisted on getting authorization from BM who was not amused at all to be called away from whatever he was doing that day to authorize overtime. A short description of the  situation was needed, BM was seething and muttered something about deducting the additional expense from SR's bonus (so it wouldn't cost him or the company a penny) - and since we didn't have anything in the contract, he went full hog and authorized me coming into work by taxi ($200 each way), quadruple overtime (yay!) and, if I needed more than 3 hours to fix the problem, a full meal in the really excellent restaurant next door and, if more than six hours, overnight hotel accommodation nearby. I didn't feel particularly  exploited that day...

Arriving at the office was a bit anti-climactic at first - I expected SR to be frantic because of the approaching deadline, but this genius had finally understood what a ""network"" means, so he had been working on another person's computer all the time, and was nearly done preparing his slides, even apologized for being rude on the phone in the first place. ""Repairing"" his computer took me only a short trip  to the server room to grab a slightly longer cable... but then the problems really began.

Back then, slides were slides, as in physical slides, not powerpoint etc. - and for a presentation, we were able to transfer data directly from the computer to 35mm film using a special (and really expensive) film recorder with a breathtaking resolution of IIRC 640x480. First off, he hadn't announced his intention to create slides to anybody, so the stocks of film were basically empty and (Saturday afternoon in Germany...) he wasn't able to get any from the photo store he usually went to. Being more open-minded, I suggested getting some from one of the kiosks catering to tourists nearby, as they sold film as well... it never occurred to him that you could get it there as well. But... even with film, where would he get that film developed without any businesses being open? The normal ""1 hour rush job photo"" labs were closed...

SR started to get nervous to the point of screaming incoherently at the wall... until it occurred to him that in the red light district (Hamburg's famous Reeperbahn and St. Pauli), there are photo artists who will not trust their photographs to be handled by a commercial lab, so they certainly will develop their own films and might be persuaded somehow to do it for us as well. How he came across that particular bit of knowledge...? We'll never know.

Imagine 20y/o me, the prototypical nerd, a big wad of cash in hand, first of all going to the red light district, which I only knew by reputation and some of those ""look but don't touch"" trips teenagers do with their friends to prove their masculinity (ha ha), asking around for ""photographers"" (apparently the ladies of the night thought I wanted to be photographed in the act and started quoting prices for their services)... finally finding one guy agreeing to develop the film and create the slides... and coming back with receipts stating e.g. ""taxi from &lt;branch location&gt; to &lt;most notorious strip club at the time&gt;"") and ""sex pictures - express service"" - this being Germany, you have to have proper receipts to be reimbursed, and I presume even prostitutes wouldn't bat an eyelid being asked to give a receipt for services rendered. We got ripped off, paying more than 100DM (US$70) for developing that film... but in an emergency...

In the end, we did it, finished everything in time for the presentation and even had a good laugh about it before SR went to do his presentation - no idea whether he sold anything that day. On that one day, I earned more money than in a whole month otherwise, and got to learn a lot about life and the economy as such. A few weeks later, for some reason or other :) , SR and I had some explaining to do to some guy from headquarters about the ""funny"" receipts... took some months, but BM got it cleared up in the end.

t3_cwzuxl,I need my email!,"A few years back I was working as a field technician for a company that used to mainly advertise on late night tv. Was expensive as hell but most of the people did not want to lug their PC to a shop and were happy to pay what we charged. This one was unforgettable.

I got a ticket where the guy wanted same day support. Ticket said PC not responsive.

Attended site. Suspected critical windows files and folders must have been deleted. Nothing could be done, startup repair, system restore nothing worked. Only option was to do a fresh install. The guy agreed to it but asked if I could get his apps back. Replied yeah shouldn't be a problem.

While installing windows the guy (who's in his 40's) tells me his library has recently started giving free computer lessons. He always wanted to learn how to use a computer. Bought a second hand laptop and started taking the classes. Tells me of all the various things he's learnt. Pretty basic stuff, e.g. ""we learned how to add a photo on a word document"". 

Windows finished installing. Started asking him all the apps he needed. Had to do a lot of detective work in finding the invoices/serial numbers/activation codes for his Antivirus software and MS Office.

I ask if there's anything else? He says I should install his email as well. Ask if he was using outlook? He points to Google Chrome as what he was using. Ask his email address which is a Gmail account. Tell him he can just log in normally and there is no need to install anything. He wants me to show him.

Open Gmail. Entered his email and ask him to enter the password. He says he can't remember it. I try resetting his password and google wants to sent the password recovery email to his phone as a text or as a link to his recovery email (iirc, not sure what it wanted to text to the linked number. Only remember a phone was linked to it).

Problem is he does not have another email. The phone linked is not his. Ask him what he wants me to do. Tells me he really needs his email. Advise him we are charging by the hour and he says that is fine and he's happy to pay. But I need to get his emails.

I then tried impersonating him to speak with google as he said he wouldn't know what to say. Didn't go anywhere.

He then gives me a password book. Couldn't find anything useful.

Found an option on google where if you give it the exact day the account was made it would potentially give you access to the account. He had no idea when the account was created. 

Ask him who made the account? Tells me does not remember. Some bloke who fixed his computer a few years back. Ask if he still has his number. He gets his diary and gives me a few numbers. I call them 1 by 1 explaining the situation and asking if the email address starting with as**** was theirs as it is set up as a recovery email for the guy I am working for. Finally get a hit on the 3rd guy. He forwards me the password reset email.

I am ecstatic. Finally got somewhere. I reset his password and log on to his email account and my smile turns into a frown. All his emails are missing. I start thinking wtf am I gonna tell him now. Wasted 1 hour for this. The only email I can see is the Welcome to Gmail from 3 years ago.

Ask him if he knows how many emails he had and if he would know why they are missing.

t3_cx1jx0,"That can't be the solution, it doesn't involve *you* just fixing it magically","Today I had a disgruntled customer call in regarding a ticket we had escalated up to our level 2 department. Within the day the level 2 technician responded with a well-thought-out response filled with edited screenshots with highlighted points of interest, explanations on several likely causes of the problem, and finally information on who would most likely be able to help them with this issue.

The customer emailed them back with an email two sentences long that more or less said, ""No, that can't be it."" and then waited for all of 18 minutes to call into me and get in touch with the agent in question.

Of course, the agent in question responded at something like 6pm the previous night, so of course, he's a second shifter and is unlikely to be in at 8am.

Granted my understanding wasn't 100%. Especially when it came to explaining why a secondary, third party system might be the cause—sure the input and error are on our system, but the other system is the messenger that carries the input to its destination. In the end, the customer got frustrated with me literally just re-reading the email and trying to walk him through the information he had already dismissed out of hand and demanded I reach out to the level 2 agent so he could speak to him.

&gt;**Me, in Slack:** Hello Lenny. John Smith called in and wanted to speak to you directly regarding case XXXXXX. He feels like the information provided was unrelated to his issue. The well-thought-out points he raised backed with technical expertise were varied, such as, ""it can't be our settings, this is how it's always been done"" and ""I don't see what the secondary software company has to do with your system errors.""

&gt;I wasn't really able to provide a satisfactory answer aside from trying to re-explain the information you sent because my knowledge on all of this is limited, but at John's request, I agreed to reach out and see if I could get ahold of you. This is that effort so that I can say I did. I apologize. Have a great day.

&gt;**Me, on the phone:** Alright, I've reached out to Lenny and provided him all of the information you provided to me. He'll be in touch with you as soon as he is able. Is there anything else I can help you with?

&gt;**John:** Actually, yes. About this other ticket number XXXXXX. You guys responded but I don't agree with the answer. Why should I have to pay for training in how to use this system? I just have a few basic questions on how to operate it and set it up!

I sighed internally once more and finished off the last of my coffee realizing I was going to be spending another half-hour sitting here re-reading a ticket off to him and convincing him it was the solution before I set in motion the inevitable re-escalation, de-escalation, ticket/phone call cycle I was about to perpetuate that had been going on with this second ticket for two weeks.

Some people just want you to tell them what they want to hear; to hell with due process and technical expertise. It's not the solution *they* want; God forbid they have to lift a god damn finger themselves to correct it.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cwylsy,A dirty screen,"Serving as a humble tier 2 helpdesk monkey is my fate,  
With fun jobs like “upon your website, how do I this resource locate”,  
The ubiquitous “Can you help me, my account to activate”  
And of course the ol’ perennial  “I forgot my password, mate”

The query of this tale is, of that list, the latter  
And begins as all my stories do “Kangaroo here, what’s the matter?”  
“Hi Kangaroo, Joanna here, this is my third helpdesk natter  
My password will not work and my phone I want to batter”

“Worry not, good Joanna”, I start into my spiel  
Let us verify your identity and the answer, good lady we’ll  
be able, working together, eventually to reveal”  
A simple set and forget, an easy case, I feel.

We confirm all of her details just as normal standard and stock,  
Enabling me, while on the phone, her account to unlock,  
I see that her last call to us was around about 4 o’clock,  
And being quarter to five, her speed is quite a shock,

I mean, really lady, it’s not been an hour yet,  
Don’t you think ‘tis a little quick, your password to forget,  
“I’m hope that you can help me tonight Kangaroo, I bet  
I’ve done something dumb, I’ve not met tech that likes me yet”

I straighten up upon my chair and gently adjust my arse  
“Alright, let’s get this straightened out, I’ll now reset your pass  
I see [johannav@chotchkes.com](mailto:johannav@chotchkes.com) is that your email address?”  
“J O H A N N A V at chotchkes? Indeed the answer’s yes.

“Alright I’ve sent an email now” I say and I do see  
Upon my screen her username displayed, johanńav  
“The email has arrived” “Great, then click on our linky,  
to transport yourself to our password reset facility”

“Done” she says “”so my password I type in?”  
“Yes”, say I, that sounds right, that’s where we begin”  
“Then, where it says ‘confirm the pass’ I type it in again?”  
Good idea, do try that, yes indeed that’s quite a plan”

“Done” says she, “and now I hit the register button there?”  
“No, no,” say I, “please hit the one saying ‘Log on’, if you’d care”  
“Nothing seems to happen when I try clicking there”  
“Then could you try...” “I think it’s... oh, it’s loaded now, oh yeah”

“If you could type in, now, your pass and username”  
“my username? johannav?” “yes, one and the same”  
“and password, \*mumbly mumble\* now it’s in” she doth exclaim  
“Invalid ID and pass combo” the site complains.

“Hmm, that’s odd, could you try again” to Johanna, say, I do,  
Says Johanna “try again I have” can this be true?  
“Invalid ID and pass combo” the message doth come through,  
“Oh bother” now what’s the next step we’re meant to move on to?

Right-ho thunk I has this darned lady somehow got it wrong  
“Okay, type in the address bar – initech.com  
and in the top right corner click the button marked log on  
then try again and tell me this  time just how you have gone”

“Invalid ID and pass combo” oh bother, not once more,  
Is this dang person doing just the same thing as before?  
And the username upon my screen again I saw  
johanńav it said, “johannav” I read, “are you sure?”

To keep it brief, I ask you, reader, reread verses 6 to 10  
That’s right, we went back through the whole damn thing again  
And I must tell you, readers, dear ladies and gentlemen,  
I was not entirely surprised what happened then

The same. So miss fat fingers cannot type?  
We’ll have to try a third time with the same old load of tripe,  
But how to make it look different enough without her going in strike  
Aha, thunk I, let’s just make sure we’ve set the password right.

“Dear Lady” did I say “can you once more click that logon?”  
“And this time, hit forgot password, when on that page you’ve gone”  
“My username and email” “yes, dear lady, that’s the one”  
“No matching combination” oh heck, now things just got fun.

So on my own computer to initech.com I go,  
Can I match her stupidity or figure how she wrong did go?  
Logon, forgot password, copy pass and mail, oh no!  
“No matching combination” my tension begins to show.

And then I spot something I before had not seen,  
A strange little dot I try to wipe off of my screen,  
I resist the urge to shout something obscene  
Upon a letter in her username interposed a tilde has been.

How she did that on her phone, I do not rightly know,  
But somehow when she registered, our lovely lady Jo  
Had managed to mistype, upon her phone, her name, oho!  
johanńav I changed that second n and all was go.

TLDR a woman called and she could not log in  
A tilde there in her username in the end gave me a win.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cwvoji,HDMI - the killer of Internet,"A temporary (read as permanent) solution placed months ago, was finally fixed today. (I apologize for formatting, on mobile)

A few months ago a wireless access point was moved to a different location in the office and a computer with a wireless NIC started having intermittent connection issues. It was assumed that the connection was too terrible for the fancy (expensive) software this computer was running. 

There is only one network drop in the room so hardline was not an option. The temporary fix was a small 8 port switch and everything continued clicking along. Fast forward a few months, some anomaly caused the switch to deadline.

Today was the day for a permanent solution. While troubleshooting the internet a constant ping to google showed underwhelming results, but while checking all the connections and picking up the mini form factor computer the ping showed a solid connection. Once the computer was placed back on the desk the destination became unresponsive.

Touch the computer, connection is good....stop touching it, no connection.  What could it have been? As many of you can already guess, every external device was then unplugged, remote into the computer, and solid connection. Start plugging everything back in and still solid. Plug in the display, connection lost. Next step, unplug the cable and throw it on the the user’s desk, they are baffled.  None of the specialty cables are available, but a mini display port was also available. One adapter and a new HDMI cable and they are back in business with an actual solution.

TL;DR A bad HDMI cable that still showed a display cause the wireless NIC to have intermittent network issues. Replaced cable, problem solved.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cwowmu,Dell owes me a beer or 12...,"Edit: Wow! so i went out for a few beverages last night after work n woke up today n this blew up!! This was my first post here on TFTS, so just wanted to drop a thank you to all of you for the upvotes and for my first 3 silvers ever! You guys are awesome!

&amp;#x200B;

So this is actually happening right now.Prologue: I'm a SysAdmin for a small web development company. Bought an employee a refurbished XPS 8930 desktop back in June, and ever since have been fighting memory errors and display issues. My boss finally fed up with listening to me complain says ""it's 2 months old, just warranty the damn thing"". (having done this before) I begrudgingly chat thru dell, explaining the issues to someone who keeps insisting we're troubleshooting a laptop (red flag #1). After convincing her that it is 100% a desktop PC, she determines that the motherboard needs replaced. Naturally this is beyond the skillset of any regular old SysAdmin and needs to be performed by a ""Dell certified technician"". She schedules me an appointment for last Friday, nobody shows (red flag #2). Tuesday a rather grumpy older gentleman in his late 50's shows up to my office with a single stick of RAM (red flag #3). After 2 hours he determines that the motherboard does indeed need to be replaced. So he schedules me another service call for today. And here we are...

Characters - $me and $dct (dell certified techician)

I get a call at 10am from a gentleman who is not the tech that was at my office yesterday to confirm my address. i explain where i am at and he says he's very familiar with the area. Also he wants to troubleshoot the PC over the phone as he has no idea what the initial issue was or what actions were performed the day before (red flag #4) At 1pm I get a call, he's 2 towns over and lost (red flag #5). At 1:45 the gentleman is not only knocking on my office door but also appears to be knocking on heaven's gate if you catch my drift... So i lead him to the computer in question

$dct - what model is this, i've never seen a dell like this before (red flag #6)  
$me - uh... says dell right on the front, it's an XPS  
$dct - well lemme take a look under the hood..... how do i open it? (red flag #7)  
$me - ... um.... (pops panel off)  
$dct - so what did they do yesterday?  
$me - replaced the RAM  
$dct - did that fix the problem?  
$me - (screaming internally) ...i don't think it did...  
$dct - (does some kind of elementary school diagnostics) well looks like i'll have to replace the motherboard.

The extremely elderly mans hands are shaking so bad he can barely hold a screw driver. But i play dumb and kindly get out of his way so he can do the super difficult ""dell certified"" stuff....

So he finishes replacing the motherboard, turns the computer on, runs the dell diagnostics n gets the green check marks on all components. Feeling quite satisfied with himself, boots the PC.

$dct - hmmm... says PXE boot failed, press any button to reboot and try again. I don't know what that means.  
$me - you need to change the boot order (i know he prob will have to reinstall or repair windows, but we havent gotten that far yet)  
$dct - the boot order? i don't know how to do that (red flag #8)  
$me - (my soul hurts) F12  
$dct - (after about 10 attempts and still cant get the boot options menu to show) i don't think it's recognizing the harddrive... I better try to reseat it. (he never touches the cables attached to the HD, instead grabs the 2 lock tabs on the drive tray, pulls the tray out about half an inch and pushes it back in) There, that oughtta do it. (reboots PC, gets PXE error again. lets call that red flags #9 thru infinity). O boy. We might just have to get you a new computer.  
$me - (I'm dying on the inside) How do we just make that happen???  
$dct - well i should call my boss first and see if he has any ideas what to do. I'm not real familiar with this model of PC. Seems really new, like it just came off the line or somethin...  
$me - (my soul is officially dead)

For about an hour, I sat and listened to this very nice older gentleman yelling to his boss on speaker phone, who was trying his absolutely best to get this guy to change the boot order. At one point, they collectively thought maybe the F12 and F2 buttons on the keyboard are both broken, lets swap that out. Surprisingly, this did nothing.

People at work have begun to email and im me asking ""what the hell is going on over in your office?!"" to which i replied ""i actually have no fking idea...""

I've actually been typing this as he's been working... Also googling how to become a dell certified technician, so that i too can someday be better at computer repair. so sorry for the crappy formatting, i'll probably have to go back and fix this.

Finally (after i had blacked out and regained consciousness) we get to booting from the harddrive and windows jumps into automatic repair mode. $dct's boss, who sounds as frustrated as i am at this point, says well it got to windows so now it's my problem which i happily agree too (even tho i know that's crap since the last time i had to have dell come out to service a PC in my office), thus concluding the saga of why dell owes me a case of beer.

TL;DR - Dell Certified Technicians are better at computer repair than SysAdmins... Even tho they don't seem to know very VERY basic computery things....",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cwvy1d,Carbon Copy,"This is more of a quirky solution story than anything else - brought to you by [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8spn15/please_sign_here/) same guy. Enjoy:

**$ttt-** me **$MD-** managing director

**$MD-** approaches my desk: ""ttt my email isn't working - they're not coming from the one I want them to. I can't check if they're sending correctly or not. Can you have a look at it?""

&gt;MD has multiple emails of his set up on his Outlook client, and operating multiple inboxes has previously shown to be a challenge for him. I just thought I'd need to show him how to specify which account he's sending an email from. No big deal.

**$ttt-** ""Yeah no worries. Run me through how you'd usually create and send an email.""

&gt;MD does this all correctly. It turns out he was just relying on the autofill to choose the right recipient every time by starting to type the name and pressing enter. But on top of that:

**$ttt-** ""MD, everything looks fine. You just need to take a second to check when autofilling these recipients. But can I ask one thing... why do you want to CC *yourself* into all your outgoing emails?""

**$MD-** ""Well I want to make sure the emails send ok? That way I get the email myself and file it away after I've checked it sent.""

**$ttt-** ""You do know you can review all your sent emails in the 'Sent Items' folder, right?""

**$MD-** ""But I can never find it so I just need to send myself a copy.""

&gt;Turns out MD was trying to CC himself into the same email he was sending out - each time making the sender a recipient, too. The autofill was filling in his *other* email address (with an identical name) and so he was never getting his 'copy' in the inbox he wanted. After finding, saving to favourites and explaining his 'Sent Items' folder made this checking process redundant, he proceeded to start dragging his sent items in to other random folders.

**$ttt-** ""Uhhh wait MD - instead of stuffing up the history of your 'Sent Items', how about I set up a rule instead? That way you can automatically have a copy sent to your inbox, then either file or delete that copy.""

**$MD-** ""...But how will that work?""

&gt;*Rule applied: send a copy to Inbox of all outgoing mail... categorised in yellow.*

**$MD-** half an hour later: ""ttt those carbon copies are working great. They're yellow and everything!""

Gotta love an easy but ultimately pointless solution that makes your boss happy.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_cwmrlp,That’s not the monitor I requested for!,"Cast:

Me: obviously me
CS: customer 
FG: facilities guy
CW: co-worker

Background: I work at a major social media company as a hardware support technician. We usually handle any hardware tickets that come our way, and don’t always interact with users. Some of the tickets we get are monitor tickets, and we have a selection of monitors that we deploy to users. Sometimes, they request for 2 monitors and the most they can have is 1 30” monitor or 2 27” monitors.

One day at work, I received a monitor ticket. The tickets was to swap a 30 inch monitor for 2 27 inch monitors. The 27 inch monitors are newer and less of a hassle to setup, so I get to work on the ticket. Once I complete the setup, I return to my desk and close the ticket. Afterwards, I had to use the restroom, and when I got back, this is what happened.

I saw CS who submitted the ticket speak to one of FG. CS was trying to explain that the ticket he submitted was done incorrectly. FG was trying to explain how the tickets work. FG then saw me and asked me to help him out. I asked what was going on and here’s how the conversation went:

CS: About my ticket, I wanted to keep my 30 inch monitor that I had before and had some other reconfigurations. I never asked to have my monitors swapped.

Me: Are you [CS name]?

CS: Yes. I was wondering why my monitors were swapped?

Me: The ticket stated that you wanted to swap your old monitor to the 27 inch models.

CS: Yes, but I actually wanted to keep my previous setup the way I had it, especially since I’ll be moving desks next week.

Me: I just saw that on the ticket, you wanted the monitors swapped.

CS: Well do you have any other 30 inch monitor that are the same brand as the 27” monitors? I want 2 30 inch monitors.

Me: I’m sorry. Company policy states that a person can either have 1 30 inch monitor or 2 27 inch monitors at most. Also, the 27 inch and 30 inch monitors are both different models.

CS: well, what am I supposed to do? I wanted 2 30 inch monitors swapped for my previous monitor.

At this point, I’m just trying to understand what this guy wants. He kept changing the request from 2 27 inch monitors to 2 30 inch monitors to 1 of each and each time I had to explain the company policy to him. Then, CW arrives and notices what’s going on. He decided to listen on the conversation. At this point, CS gives up and just tells us.

CS: OK fine. I’ll keep the 2 27 inch monitors that were setup and see how I like them. If I don’t, then I’m submitting another ticket.

Me: Alright, sounds good.

CS leaves and we were all relieved. CW explains that it’s not the first time he’s reached out to IT for requests like that one, and that I should be aware for people like that. Apparently, before I joined, CS has been known in our company to submit requests and make the requests really confusing. IT was getting tired of dealing with CS a lot, so I was told if this happens again, then I should report it to CS’s manager.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cwkqv6,Client network problem with an suprising Cause,"*Disclaimer - Sorry for any bad spelling or mistakes. English isn't my native language and I really didn't write anything in english for a long time.*

So I work for the IT in a local authority. Together with 2 dozen other IT-admins we manage about 2500 clients in 2nd-Level-Support (desktops, notebooks, convertibles and so on). 

Yesterday I had an until then unknown Cause of network problem with one of our PCs I wanted to share with you (tl;dr at the end).

We rolled out this new type of machines in late 2017 and one of this PCs isn't probably working since the very beginning. We set it up just like every other client with our client-management software. It boots up with PXE, installs the windows image and looks to be working fine. We deliver it to our client and the story would be done.

About 1-2 months later we got the information that the network is recurring failing. Since we've got a 5-year-warranty with on-site service we made a ticket, the service replaced the mainboard, tested it and closed the ticket.

Since the mainboard is switched, we have to reinstall the client for a couple of reasons. PXE boots up, installing the image, everything works like a charm, we deliver it to the client again.

A few days later the problem is occurring again. So same procedure, a colleague made a 2nd ticket, but this time the client is working fine when checked by on-site service. 

The PC is sent back to us, we check it and its failing again. So a 3rd ticket is made, the mainboard is switched again  and we get the pc back. Because of internal delays this lasts for months. This time someone stored the PC in our stock, so everyone forgot about it (the affected user got a replacement PC, so everyone is happy).

Now 1 year later i need a PC for an another demand, so I take one from our stock and guess which PC i accidentally took... 

Again, a reinstall works just perfect, everything is fine until i want to do some final configuration by RDP, which isn't working probably because of the again failing NIC. 

I begin to write the ticket, look up the history of this client and see that the mb was switched two times because of this error. I looked up the events entries in Windows, which stated that the NIC isn't reacting to any commands and is about to restart. This occurs 1-9 times everytime the client is booted up and someone logs in. This explains the long times the client doesnt participate in the network. After that it works until the next restart.

So I begin to investigate the real cause, the (**3rd**) mainboard isn't obviosly the reason for this. It doesn't seem to be the software, since its the only client that ever showed with this behavior. 

So I begin to use spare parts to look up which failing hardware causes the NIC to fail. After checking the ""easy-swaps"" without the error going disappearing - like PSU, hard drive and RAM theres only one piece thats about to get tested - the CPU.

After swapping the CPU everything works fine, by installing back the old one the error occurs immediatly again. So we've got a CPU, which causes unknown NIC failures but works perfectly fine until finishing the windows install. I've never heard of this and didn't find anything in the internet. 

I bet if I wrote another ticket without investigation I would now get the 4th mainboard replacement.

**tl;dr** \- Got a client with a failing NIC, the on-site service replaced the mainboard two times and everything worked fine until the complete reinstall. After investigation I note that the CPU is causing the NIC to crash, but operates flawless apart from the NIC.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cw9j4z,Subject: EMAIL ISN'T WORKING!!!!!!,"&gt; As the only system administrator for a small programming firm, I usually have to deal with rather stupid requests and issues. We also still use Exchange 2010, and are in the process of migrating since I took over. However, everyone has been a bit hesitant to move, since they don't like the look of Outlook 2016.     

&gt;One morning I walk in and everything is business as usual, but I receive a Gmail notification with the subject line in all caps ""EMAIL ISN'T WORKING!!!!!!"" As I begin walking to my office the VP of sales frantically signals for my attention, and knowing her habits as a user, I grimace and brace myself for her usual ineptitude. She immediately starts yelling at me.   

&gt;VP: ""The email server is down! I just sent you an email to let you know about it. I can't do any of my work without email. This is so frustrating that you guys don't react immediately to this. At my last company, those IT guys knew when the servers went down before anyone else noticed.""     

&gt;Me: ""You sent me an email telling me the email server is down from your company mail account?""    

&gt; VP: ""Yes of course I did, how else could I tell you guys it isn't working? Why don't you take these things seriously?"" she states while rolling her eyes and throwing her hands in the air for added effect. At this point I can feel my frustration in my face and try to compose myself.     

&gt;Me: ""You sent the email to my personal account. I received your email. Are you seeing any errors when sending emails?""   

&gt;  VP: ""JUST FIX THE DAMN EMAIL SERVER!"" At this point I was speaking through clenched teeth, and typed out a quick test email on my company account to send to her.     

&gt;  Me: "" VP, I understand your frustration. But I can't fix a problem that doesn't exist. I just sent you an email on my company account. Did you receive it?""   

&gt;  VP: ""OF COURSE IT WORKS IF YOU SEND IT, YOU'RE THE IT GUY! I'M GOING TO CALL THE CIO ABOUT THIS!""   

&gt;I decided to just saunter over to my office and await the confused and frantic call of my CIO. Instead I receive an email from him stating, ""Don't worry. I know it's working. Just ignore her, she blew a huge deal because she forgot to send an email and wanted to blame it on IT. I checked the mail server and didn't see anything stuck in the outbox. We're all clear.""  As I slowly chuckle to myself, she bursts into my office, which also happens to be the server room.    

&gt; VP: "" You need to set me up with webmail.""     

&gt;Me: ""You're already set up with webmail. Everyone is. I've already sent out several email with instructions on how to access it. You literally replied back to me telling me you refused to use it because you didn't like how it looked.""     

&gt;VP: ""Well I want access again in case the server goes down again and email doesn't work.""     

&gt;Me: ""If the mail server goes down and email doesn't work, webmail won't work. It's the same thing. We're in the process of moving to a hybrid solution to prepare for situations like that, but for right now there's nothing we can do other than troubleshoot the issues that arise.""   

&gt; VP: ""Then why does my Gmail and Yahoo mail work?! You don't know what you're talking about!""     

&gt;  Me: ""We don't have a Gmail or Yahoo mail server. We don't even manage those. That's completely different from our email.""     

&gt;VP: ""I'M GOING TO TELL CIO THAT IT IS UNABLE TO HELP ME!""     

&gt;  After she storms out, I go about my day, letting the soothing white noise of server fans and constant AC relax me. At the end of the day I receive a text from the CIO. It turns out she had sent too many emails to a potential client and had gotten blocked, but chose to delete the error messages she was receiving because she thought it was spam.   

&gt; Unfortunately this was normal behavior, and since she is close to the CEO, I still have to deal with her on occasion.

t3_cweqcc,My printer isn't working!!!,"A shout out to u/unhappy_computer for sharing earlier, it got me thinking about my issue today.

Background: Only IT guy at my dealership, among other job titles. 

Our finance department still uses dot matrix printers to print the contract and other forms. The system uses an emulator provided by a 3rd party, (cox automotive) to print to them. 

Finance Mgr: ""I am in the middle of a deal and the printer will not work!!

ME: (it had been a long day)"" Have you tried turning it off and on again?""

Finance Mgr: ""I don't know where the power button is, it isn't my job to know, I have customers come fix it!!!""

So I go down there, a husband and wife are sitting in the office and the Finance manager is no where to be found.
Customers said he went to go smoke. 

Awesome customer service right there.

t3_cwbi3g,Just do your job properly and fix it like you're meant to.,"This story takes place in a mobile phone repair centre in the   time shortly after the client in question was leaving us and taking their business elsewhere. As you'd expect there was a lot of upheaval. Friends and colleagues were being made redundant, temps were being let go of and generally it was not a fun time because of this. 

At the time, I worked in a senior role in 'no fault found' team. We'd deal with the customers where there was a simple enough troubleshooting fix for the complaint, but the clients retail store hadn't been able to fix the issue.

And so it begins... 

**reported fault**
STORE MANAGER ESCALATION!!! CUSTOMERS PHONE STILL HAS POOR BATTERY LIFE EVEN AFTER THE LAST ""REPAIR"". PLEASE JUST DO YOUR JOBS PROPELY THIS TIME AND FIX THE ISSUE LIKE YOU'RE MEANT TO! CUSTOMER VERY UNHAPPY.

I took a look at the notes on the previous job. 

_reported fault of poor battery life verified. Cause of issue is [specific 3rd party app]. Removing app has resolved the issue. Attempted to contact customer, no answer so. Left voicemail advising to not reinstall this app as it will reintroduce the problem._

My blood was boiling. Not only has the store manager accused my team of not doing their job when we did everything correctly, but in fact it was him and his team not doing _their_ job correctly. 

This brings me onto phase one... 

**me:** hi, I'm calling about the phone you've sent for repair. 

**customer:** oh yeah! The one you didn't fix last time! 

**me:** about that... Its this specific app you've installed causing the issue. When you get it back, don't reinstall that and it'll be fine. 

**customer:** Well why didn't you tell me this last time instead of wasting my time? 

**me:** we tried to call but didn't get through so left a message, however the store have all the relevant troubleshooting guides to have fixed this within a few minutes of you walking into the shop, so really they could've sorted this in 5 minutes without you needing to send it off to us at all. We also left them some notes on the last job explaining what I've just told you. Did they go through any of that with you? 

**customer:** no, they just booked it in straight away both times. 

The customer did a complete 180 from being mad at my team to being furious at the store, and I'd made it clear that the store had all the resources there to sort this issue out, but for whatever reason, hadn't. The customer was very keen to discuss this in person with the store manager... 

Phase one complete, onto phase two. 

**me:** hi, I'm calling from your repair centre. Can I please speak to the store manager in relation to this job? 

**store manager:** ahh yeah, you guys didn't fix this customers problem the first time round so its back with you again. The customer is NOT happy. Have you got it working again now? 

**me:** I'm actually calling with regard to your notes claiming that we need to do our jobs properly. 

**store manager:** Well, yeah... It was still faulty after you sent it back. 

**me:** No. The customer reinstalled an app that we identified first time round to be causing the problem. _You_ didn't follow the troubleshooting guide on this, and the previous repair. You could've fixed this issue yourselves. You also didn't read my teams notes from the last repair which again could've resolved this customers issue. 

**store manager:** ahh right OK. Well hopefully the customer will be alrig-

**me:** and I'd just like to point out, as you're aware, you're repair work is going else where, however despite this we're still providing you with fantastic service. What you're accusing us of in you're notes is incorrect and offensive to the technicians who've worked on your repairs with the same effort as always despite the threat of redundancies hanging over them. Everyone here has done their jobs correctly and the phone is on its way back. When it's returned, please do your job properly this time, OK?

**store manager:** Well, er... Yeah ok, sorry about that. Just this customer was really mad. Hopefully he'll be OK when he comes to collect the phone and I'll tell him what he needs to do. 

**me:** don't worry, I've already told him what to do. He mentioned he has a few questions for you when he comes to collect the phone...",talesfromtechsupport

Building my own computers, having a job at a helpdesk next to my studie. You get the point, the family-nerd.

In those days, my father called me because he had to install a program and wasn't sure how to do it. So on the phone (I was living about 600 kilometers away from home in the city of my university), guiding him through the process. Get the plastic off, insert disk 1, ""yes the disk with 1 at it and the written side up. Type cd a:, type install, now wait. Yes it is supposed to do the noise"". System asks for disk 2? Insert disk 2 and press enter. Going pretty wel so far. System ask for disk 3? Well, insert disk 3 and 4.

What do you mean, you can't insert disk 4? It won't fit??? The my father told, the second and third disk were already very hard to get in. Excuse me??? Then I got an idea. Asked him ""did you take out disk one before you you entered disk 2?"". The famous answer was ""No, you didn't say I should, you only said to put in disk 2 (and 3 and 4).""

Yes, it was in the time of the 5,25""-single-side disks. He managed to get 3 floppies in it. He was so nice to put the pc in his car and drove to my place (instead of letting me on a 2x all-day-train-trip on a weekend to fix it). Took me a few hours to get the disks out unharmed. I also installed the program for him as he was in my place.

I was starting to get a bit short with the user because it was a simple task and he just wasn't getting it. I said fine, I'm going to send ""Bob"" up (not real name). ""Bob"" was busy so I ended up going up there instead. I went to the users computer and said ""Hi, I'm from IT"" and he explained the problem.

Background:  
There was a specific phone line called the ""Need Line"" or the Red Phone which was our classroom emergency line. Professors called it when there were students in the seats and ~~whatever technological wonder they had planned~~ their PowerPoint wasn't working. Calling it would ensure an immediate escalation to tier 2 techs to ~~ride to the rescue~~ respond to solve the issue.

What Went Down:  
The Red Phone rings and $SE answers the phone. I listen to her interacting w/ $AP (a professor who has a reputation for being a jackass to IT already). She gathers the pertinent details and repeats them back to $AP to make sure we are correct. $AP finds this clarification needless and says ""DID I STUTTER?"" in such a way that is clearly audible to those of us in the room. $SE looks like she has just been physically slapped in the face, but explains the clarification is necessary to make sure our techs respond to the right situation. $AP hangs up and the situation is escalated properly. $AP's reputation with the HelpDesk degrades to the point where any future tickets at normal priority are assigned the max 48 hour appointment even if there is something earlier.

t3_cw1zzf,It helps if you can see color,"This is from about five years ago, so forgive me if some of the events are a little out of order. I used to work as a tv/ appliance repair man for a furniture/ electronics/ appliances chain of stores, my day would start with me working on the computers and sound systems at the store then I would drive out to people’s houses to work on their televisions and appliances, I had a work truck and a portable printer, so I was able to do my own thing. 

One day, while I was checking on parts that I ordered, the store manager (who is not my boss, but sometimes you have to go along to get along) came up to me and asked if I could add one more stop to my drive, he sold someone a tv and the screen would only display black and white, so I asked him for the address and went ahead, I was going to make that my last stop for the day since it was on my way home.

I get to the house and who I guess was the owner let me inside, upon walking in, there were four people just staring at me like at any moment, I would yell “POLICE!!” I shrugged this off and asked where the tv is. The owner never turned a single light on in the house, just took me to the tv that was sitting in the dark, the only light was the black and white screen displaying a scooby doo cartoon.

I’m not going to include why all of the lights were off but I’m sure you can use your imaginations, I learned this when I pulled my mini lantern out of my work bag and that’s when I see the problem, within five seconds, their tv is in color again.

The owner thanked me and asked what I did, I told him that it was technical, trying to help him save face, but I’m stared at by everyone yet again, so I had to tell the truth, I PUT THE YELLOW CORD IN THE YELLOW HOLE!!!
I expected some embarrassment but no one there was ashamed at all, so I packed up and made a call to the store manager and I let him know what happened, he made a deep sigh and thanked me.

t3_cvb7ww,"""My camera system doesn't work during the night""","I work as tech support for a company that sells access control, alarm and video surveillance products. I'm on the phone all day, helping installers with any technical issue they could have with our products.




I get a call from a technician that is his own boss, he's kind of a one man show. He has no employee and mostly does small business or residential camera system installations, so when he calls, it's never a real, unsolvable issue. He installs lower end cameras and DVRs that are pretty much plug and play.



So he calls me, and he's at his customer's location, which is a small family owned business. His customer is right next to him. The problem is that ""His camera system is not recording at night"".



Okay, I get calls like this every day. I'm 99% sure the problem is that he didn't set the schedule correctly.



So I walk him through the menus, and he slowly makes his way to the Storage Schedule section. After having him tell me what he sees on the screen, we determined that the recording schedule for his storage is not the problem. There is another section in the menu where you can enable motion detection to work only at certain time, so I help him navigate to that section, but it was set for 24/7. 




So the issue wasn't in the DVR menu. At this point I'm thinking that he went into each individual camera's setting, and it's the camera themselves that doesn't have the right schedule. We can't browse the web interface of the camera when it's on the DVR, unless you have a laptop and some ipv4 knowledge.



So I have the technician grab his laptop in his truck and I walk him through setting up his network card to the right IP. After about 30 minutes of back and forth, he finally gets to one of the camera's web interface, only to realize that the schedule was left by default, with the right settings. So that wasn't the issue either.




At this point all my ideas were shot down. The technician kept on saying that the issue was with the product, but I knew it was almost impossible.



I had a look at the time the videos would stop and start recording. It was never at the same time. Sometimes it would start at 6:30 am and stop at 9:20PM, sometimes it was 7 AM to 8PM. 




So the technician puts his customer on the phone. I ask him about what he does when he gets in the morning, what times does he leaves at night, and what he does before leaving.



It turns out, the first thing the guy does when he gets to work in the morning is flick the light switch on and turn on his PC. Then when he goes home at night, he turns off the light before walking out of the building. I ask him to turn off the light right now. He does, and the DVR immediately shuts down. His DVR was plugged in on the same outlet as the lights, so it's only working when the lights are on.




Needless to say, the technician was super embarassed. We were on the phone for about 50 minutes before we realize what's going on.

I guess the moral of this story is that you can't assume that anything is properly installed, you and should start the troubleshooting process to the very basics, even if it seems stupid obvious.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cv3464,"Not a flaw anymore, it's now a FEATURE!","I worked as a project manager for an engineering company for about 10 years or so. This is about one project where we built 10 custom control panels for a customer a month of basically 2 very similar design. The difference was whether it had a single or dual gauge pressure controls installed. One month they order the 10 of the single design and our shop accidentally laid out and built the dual design by mistake.  They refuse the order and we shelve all the cases and back panels that were drilled for the extra gauge and regulators. This was not a good thing, but not the end of the world either. 

They haunted my shop foreman as he could see them on the shelf every day while he worked. Many months later we get a rush order for 10 of the single units. Unfortunately, these units were spec'd for Allen Bradley enclosures and at that time there were none to be had anywhere in the country. Customer is screaming they need these units ASAP!! I tell my shop guy to get the cases down and to put hole covers in the extra holes for the pressure regulator, layout and use the dual design on the back panels for the gauges. 

Now I call the customer and explain that I have made an engineering change for our finished product. It now comes in a dual control ready enclosure only. This will reduce the number of variants, inventory, and UL certification issues that we have to deal with. Now if they need to upgrade a panel from single to dual in the field it is a breeze. Add the gauge, the pressure controls a couple of terminal blocks and there you go! ""Bob's your uncle!"", as some say. I showed my boss the plan I had hatched and he laughed at me. Brilliant! So, you are telling me we can fill the order right away with parts on hand that they refused months ago? That is correct, sir. Just wanted to run it by you before I hit the customer with our new ""Streamlined manufacturing process"". The customer was all for it, thought it would be great for simplifying production and inventory management, also realized this was a real selling point for their salespeople as well!

t3_cuzevo,I set fire to the shredder,"This is a self burn, these are rare, but I'll caveat this that I was IT, and I was the apprentice, they paid me pittance, and I had to accept that some days I was free labour.

Anyway, working at a local council I was at we had a metric shitload of old dot matrix ribbon fed printers, these constantly chugged out reports from legacy systems. Gotta love government hey.

Anyway, the law said this stuff needed to be archived for 7 years, and half of it (actually 99% of it) was garbage reports you read once (at the printer) and let fall into the box.

So, here I am, 7 years later working there when heaps of this stuff comes up for ""Permanent Archiving"" (which was great, as a lot of it was in our IT Backroom)

So the boss graciously volunteers me as tribute to get it done on the basis of it helping the IT Department get some room back.

So here I am, doing what I'm shown, feeding a pile of papers into the shredder, tearing off about a dozen at a time and letting them run through.

For the young ones, [here's a picture of the printer paper setup](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTCRNzlsXb8LSaDKJV-p35FwPtSRXKJRd_skhDbs8lV8yorIjkM) so that you understand what I'm about to say.

Now, me being bright thought ""fuck it, I'll get more done by running the whole sheets through"" thinking the office lady that told me to do it manually was an idiot (I was 17, anyone I didn't agree with was an idiot)

Anyway, I read the shredder ""up to 8 sheets at a time"" it says on the front.

So I line up 8 boxes.

I take the top sheet off every one and make it into a neatly stacked ribbon.

I feed it into the shredder and admire my work.

I'm getting 8 boxes done in the time it used to take me to do 1, half that.

I'm going across the road for a coffee.

Yeah, on my way back, coffee and ham, cheese, tomato croissant in hand, I see the fire alarm going off, people evacuating, and the fire brigade screaming up and running inside.

I locate the IT Department and we all have a chuckle, and go down to get coffees, we'll, me to drink mine and them to get some.

Midway through coffee my boss gets a call, I hear the ""Really?"" and ""You sure?"" and ""That doesn't sound right"" and ""OK, I'll tell him""

So he puts down the phone and explains to me that while yes, my idea was great, and he sees exactly where I was coming from, the shredder was never designed for continuous operation eating ribbons of paper.

The duty cycle on the shredder was a whopping 45 seconds we found out when the Gilbarco guy came out, we estimated the shredder actually lasted 15 minutes.

Props though, I was off the hook as when they pulled the shredder apart they found that it had a thermal overload to prevent this and that had failed. So really, the printer should have turned off before catching fire.

t3_cusicj,"""We just thought we'd some new phones...""","A client of my company had sent in a ticket complaining about one of their DECT phones shutting down when taken off the charging station for only a few minutes. This is usually a result of old chargeable batteries that just won't charge properly after a couple of months/years depending on the quality.

We let them know that we suspected this was the problem and that we would order some of those batteries for them. The order would arrive next day and we had time to drive it out to them the day after that. The receptionist thanked us for this trivial service as she had no idea what kind of batteries the phone needed (chargeable AAA).

The manager didn't agree though. But didn't let us know any of it.

2 days took way too long apparently. If he had decided to get some batteries himself that would fit and be chargeable there wouldn't even be any harm done. We needed new stock anyway.
But instead of listening to us and checking the batteries, he'd decided he'd just buy a new set of phones with base station and everything. Keep in mind that this was for one out of three phones not working properly.

Here's the kicker. They used VoIP, he bought a landline compatible DECT set (with only an rj11 socket).

Meanwhile we hadn't heard anything after we'd spoken to the receptionist. So when the manager called us why his new phones wouldn't work we didn't really know how to respond. When we got there with the new batteries we saw what he'd done and for the life of him he couldn't understand how these new phones wouldn't work. He managed to get power to the base station without any other cable plugged in so the handsets got a signal from it but the line was dead of course. 

After putting in the replacement batteries the problematic handset worked fine and we switched everything back to how it used to be.
I dont think you can get a refund on entirely unpacked hardware so that was tough for the manager.

Communication wasn't his strong suit. I'll post another story later about him and his printer.

Edit: [Here's the link to the other story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/cuw6yy/the_fuser_that_fused/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cuw6yy,The fuser that fused,"This is the story of the printer in a small dental practise that I described in my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/cusicj/we_just_thought_wed_some_new_phones/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) with a manager who doesn't really listen.
I'm part of a small tech support company which supports all types of businesses.

This practice naturally had a waiting area with a receptionist desk. Behind it were two PC's which had the dental software and a printer. The area behind the counter was rather small as in you had to scoot behind whoever was manning the desk by pressing yourself against the wall behind it. The printer itself was placed ontop of a small stool past the two receptionist against the far wall from where you entered.

One fateful day the receptionist calls us because of a paper jam. They explained they tried to get it out, but only managed to rip off a few pieces. They are afraid to do anything else to prevent further damage which I give them credit for. Not that it mattered but you'll know why later.

I make an appointment to come check it out asap as they need to be able to print and dont have another option. On my way I go with some basic tools and cleaning stuffs to prevent any further jams.

When I get there and set up my tools in the cramped area I can see little bits of torn paper sticking out from where the paper usually comes out when printed. Usually you can solve such a jam by opening up some side panels, but there appears to be nothing there. Where is the paper stuck then?

I soon come to the conclusion that I can't service this printer any further from that cramped location with the tools I had and ask if I can take the printer with me to the office for further inspection and maybe additional help. Receptionist is ok with it but in walks the manager.

""You can't take that printer with you, I need to be able to print my forms.""

But... You can't print anyway...

Going back and forth a bit and he finally agrees if I set up an old canon printer he had in storage or somewhere.
I do the needful.

When I take the printer back and pry it open I finally found how it was jammed. The fuser apparently got dirty due to cheap refilled ink/toner cartridges that leaked too much ink/toner to handle. (The fuser fuses the ink or toner to the paper using heat)

We warned the practice the last time we had to clean it and we advised to get better quality so we don't have to come back for it another month as using refills is pretty much playing Russian roulette. Get a cartridge that's only refilled once you're in luck, get one refilled 6 times you're going to have trouble. Also your warranty is void when using these cartridges.

Anyways, due to too much ink the paper sheets got stuck to the fuser roller one after another and after sheet 3 the printer ate the paper. Explains why I couldn't get to it through the side panels.

We contact a hardware partner to see what we can do and they advise we just get a new printer because the fuser costs more than the printer (I know, doesn't make sense but it's true).
We contact the manager and explain how and why and why there's no warranty. He isn't happy of course but knows we can't help it any further. We let him know we can order a new one for him and it will be there in 2 days. Sound familiar? (Reference previous post)

That's the last time we heard anything from him untill about a week later. We need to setup his new printer because he can't...

Why do you have a contract with us if you don't use it? We could've gotten it done in 2 days including setup...",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cuxp8c,"""My emails seem to be coming in, thank you....""","A customer had came into chat/IM-style connection and was confused where all her emails were hiding. Confused by her unclear typing, I did my due diligence and got connected to her computer with her permission to do so. Looking into it revealed she just had one email from July, and I decided to send her a test one as well from my email. After verifying the email worked, she was still confused where the rest of her emails were at.

As one would expect, I verified whether she has multiple emails to choose from (\[*c-email1**...*\], \[*c-email2**...*\]) which it turns out she does, and has two gmail accounts! So, of course, I advised that she would need to log into \[*c-email2*\] to see the emails she's expecting to see since she's currently logged into \[*c-email1*\]*.*

Notes from a previous case indicated that she didn't know the password for \[*c-email2*\] and trying to reset the password was unsuccessful (or as unsuccessful as ""We'll review and reach back out in 3-5 days."" can be). Regardless of that though, we did the same thing again today, to the same end result. She decides she doesn't need further support, ends the session, and I go about my merry way.

An hour later I get an email from her, as a response to my original test message. It says:

To: \[*myEmail*\]  
From: \[*c-email1*\]  
""MY E-MAILS SEEM TO BE COMING IN, THANK YOU  FROM: \[*c-email2\]""*

I somewhat feel bad that she doesn't recognize she didn't send that from the email she thought she was sending it from.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cufdh7,Why sliding computers is a bad idea,"Way back in the day, when Compaq 286s and Mac SE 30s were top-of-the-line machines, I was the sole IT person in the company.  Man, that's almost 30 years now.  Time flies.  Dialog is obviously paraphrased from what was actually said.

We had two computer rooms, one for PCs and one for Macs.  The consultants in the company would generally use the PCs to crunch their numbers (Lotus 1-2-3 for DOS if you can believe it) and the Macs to do word processing (good old MS Word 5.1 for Mac) and business slides (MacDraw) for presentations.

Most of the Macs were 512K Macs with dual floppy drives, but we had just acquired an SE30 with a whopping 20 MB hard drive.  This baby was smoking fast, and was the preferred machine to work on for most.

One day, I get paged to the Mac room.  I walk in and Bob is sitting there, looking fairly worried.

""This error message is telling me that my file is corrupted.  You need to recover it; it's vital for a presentation tomorrow!""

""Okay, I'll try my best.  Let me sit there and take a look.""

Now, Bob was known for being a bit of a contrarian.  If you told him to do something, he'd find a way to not comply.  So instead of getting up and letting me sit in the chair in front of the SE 30, he reached over, put his hand on the side of the SE 30 and slid it over to where I was standing next to him.

If you aren't familiar with SE 30s (or any of the original all-in-one Mac bodies), they are fairly light and top heavy machines.  While he didn't tip the SE 30 over, its narrow footprint and rubber ""feet"" made it very prone to ""chattering"" when being slid.

And that's exactly what it did while I was shouting, ""No, don't!"", lunging forward to stop him.

Too late.  Instant sad Mac icon on the screen.

""Well, you may have to postpone tomorrow's presentation.""

""Why?  What happened?""

""You toasted the hard drive.""

""What?""

""That chattering or bumping when you slid it caused the read/write heads to literally crash into the hard drive platters and physically destroyed the hard drive.""

""No way.  Well, you have to fix it and recover the data.""

""Not happening here.  You'd need a clean-room and lots of time and money.""

""Find out how much and let me know how much.  The client will pay for it.""

So, I went and spent about 2 hours investigating if there were any firms in the Boston area that would do this kind of HD recovery.  There was one (still in business today!) and they were not cheap.  If I recall, they quoted me a low 5-figure number and even then couldn't guarantee success.  They said that it was usually government agencies that needed such measures taken.

I relayed the price figure to Bob and he flipped out.  He couldn't believe it would be that expensive, and started making noise about me making up the price, and generally hinting that he would try to get me in trouble for not just doing what he was demanding.  I think he even offered to negotiate the price with the data recovery firm.

""Okay, Bob.  Let's go ask Dave.""

Luckily for me, Dave, the president of the company (my boss) was quite tech savvy, and he shut down Bob's harangue pretty quickly.

He finally asked Bob what had been lost.

""About 15 pages of a presentation.""

""Had you ever printed it out?""

""...""

""Bob?""

""Yes, I have a printout from yesterday, but I had made a lot of edits.""

""Well, do them again.  I'm not paying $10,000 for you to not have to redo edits you just made yesterday.""",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cup7i6,"The Ballad of Sam, Part 2... ""It doesn't work, it won't turn on""","I’m gonna go ahead and write this one while it’s fresh….

&amp;#x200B;

CB = Me, Codebooker, Private Tech Guy Who Does IT Work

RE = Sam (not her real name), the Restaurant Employee, a 30-something-year-old woman who has worked at this restaurant for many years

RO = Bill (not his real name), the Restaurant’s Owner, a 40-something-year-old dude who has been running this place for many years

Backstory: Earlier this week I upgraded this client from one POS terminal to two POS terminals so that the restaurant will be ready for the inevitable influx of customers that’ll come Labor day weekend. The upgrade went fine, I only had to take their POS system out of service for one business hour while the software was upgraded, then they were able to use the main terminal again while I finalized the config on the second POS terminal. I managed to get everything rolling and both terminals fully functional, and everyone was happy with it. Picking up this evening, about an hour ago, which is months after the timeframe in which my last tales from tech support post referring to this client took place. Same restaurant employee as last time, except this time, she’s been drinking (however I didn’t know this until I arrived on-site)… So she's even less tech-savvy than her normal level of tech-savviness which is rather low. This wonderful situation started with a text message from the RO…

&amp;#x200B;

RO: “U up?”

CB: (stupidly answering my phone this late at night) “Yeah, what’s wrong?”

RO: “Computers locked up”

CB: “Both?”

RO: “Yes, and they won’t reboot”

RO: “Main register locked up good and now the bartender said she can’t access tabs on the second register”

(The main register feeds the secondary register via an SMB share on a secure network, so if the main one screws up, the second one won’t work either)

RO: “She said it won’t let her do anything so I told her to pull the plug from the wall, then wait five minutes and plug it back in”

(At this point I’m internally thinking, “Shit!… That’s not good… That could cause other issues...”)

CB: “Unplugging a running computer is never a good idea, ever. To force a computer off safely you’re supposed to hold the power button for 5 – 10 seconds, but you should have called me before telling the bartender to do anything”

(I think he was trying to avoid paying an after-hours charge for me coming out)

CB: “I’m on my way”

&amp;#x200B;

So I get there and it was RE again, except this time she’s a bit on the drunk side, I found out from a dude at the bar that she’d been drinking lemon drop shots with one of her friends when that friend came in earlier. So, she was useless as a witness to the problem, other than to tell me that “it doesn’t work, it won't turn on”.

I plugged everything in and hit the power button and what do you know, the power button turned the thing on… It came up just like it was supposed to. I logged in to the POS software, then went and restarted the software on the second terminal and then logged in there too. The restaurant was back up and running. I checked the error log on the software and on Windows Event Viewer and found nothing irregular, so I suspect it was operator error rather than a software problem. I told her to get up with me if the ‘problem’ happens again. I also informed RO that his bartender was inebriated on the job and this was a potential cause of the 'problem', but if there is an issue again ""please call me before telling the bartender to force off a running computer"".

tl;dr Drunk Bartender + POS Terminals = “It doesn’t work! It won't turn on!”",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cujl0z,*Please read THE ENTIRE INSTRUCTION LIST before attempting to follow it*,"This is a disclaimer at the top of my VPN setup instruction page. In bold. In full, it reads:

&gt;**Please read and understand THE ENTIRE INSTRUCTION LIST at least once before attempting to follow it. It will save you a lot of headache instead of following it blindly!**

We run Mac and Linux, so I have instructions for both, but there are shared instructions for the core parts - namely, generating a certificate pair on the intended machine and sending the CSR to me.

A remote user who lives in another country visited for our summer party. He'd previously asked for VPN access to share screens with his colleagues. No problem, management approved, here's the link to the instructions. This person has a Ph. D. in computer science and is an extremely intelligent AI researcher. So naturally, they have no clue how to do simple tasks.

Via Slack:

&gt;$user: hey $me, I followed the instructions and OpenVPN is telling me the config is invalid.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: er, which instructions are you following? There are several steps preceding that which involve you talking to me first.  
&gt;  
&gt;$user: I renamed the OpenSSL config file to .ovpn

Head, meet desk. Have a conversation.

Respecting SSL best practises, I ask the users to generate the certificate pair because then the private key never leaves their machine. The instructions are (essentially):

1. Download this barebones OpenSSL config file (pre-filling most of the required values).
2. Using the config file, copy and paste this OpenSSL command, replacing $HOSTNAME with your computer's asset tag.
3. Find the .csr file and send it to me to sign.
4. I'll send you back a zip containing the config and all the necessary files (except your private key).
5. You add the private key and import the config file.

&gt;$me: so you didn't read the instructions?  
&gt;  
&gt;$user: I did nothing but read the instructions.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: and yet you still did it wrong. &lt;copy and paste the big bold disclaimer&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$user: Having read the instructions, I remember that line!  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: apparently it's the only line you did. read Steps 2 &amp; 3 again.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: i also notice that you didn't ping me about the prerequisite step?

The prerequisite step involves setting up an LDAP account; $user has been with the company longer than I have, before I built the domain. Ergo, his laptop has a local account, while my VPN has LDAP auth. The prerequisite instructions, which detail how to change his password from the default (asking me for the default) are highlighted multiple times.

&gt;$user: I didn't even get there yet. I thought using the OpenSSL with the GUI that asked for an OpenSSL config was part of 'getting' OpenVPN.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: ...  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: &lt;copy and paste the big bold disclaimer a second time&gt;

Fortunately after the second prompting, he did go back and read the instruction list in full, and sent me the correct .csr. Everything went smoothly after that.

I'm going to change the disclaimer slightly. **It will save $me a lot of headache!**

And perhaps add a second disclaimer:

&gt;If you do not read these instructions and do it wrong, I reserve the right to quote your chat transcripts at length on social media to highlight your mistakes.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_ctxej9,“I’m so sick of the entire IT department! She’s too dumb to figure it out herself!”,"I’m a college student and have been working at my university library’s tech support for a few years. We service all of the staff members in the whole library, most of which are very sweet librarians and the rest are awful human beings. 

In comes Staff Member (SM), a middle aged woman whom I haven’t dealt with too often. SM’s printer keeps jamming so I bring it to the IT bench to inspect, searching for scraps of paper or any damage. I then get on Dell support for 1.5 hours and they determine it needs replacement rollers, so I tell SM that it will take 24 hours for them to send the rollers and for me to reinstall her printer. The next day (Friday) the replacement rollers don’t fix the issue, so Dell sends a brand new printer that will arrive on Monday. I tell SM that I will setup her new printer once we receive it. 

On Monday, I plug in the new printer and test it and there’s some new issues. My coworker and I spent over an hour trying to work on it, failed to realize that I needed to move over the imaging drums from the previous printer. So at the end of my shift I apologize to SM and tell her we needed to work on it more tomorrow and I’ll bring it down first thing. 

So on Tuesday, I bring down her new printer. It’s not networked so it connects directly to her PC. Well, when I connect it guess what happens? PC doesn’t recognize it, so I tell her I need to play around with some settings. After 10 mins nothing is working so I tell her I’m going to consult my supervisor about what to do and I’ll come down as soon as I have a solution. 

It’s worth noting that SM wasn’t supposed to have a personal printer to begin with. She recently moved offices and the new one happened to have a printer in it so she’s been using this only for the past couple of months, meanwhile there is a shared network printer literally 5 feet from her office that everyone else in the area uses and she has access to. 

Anyway, I go back upstairs and google what to do (like all good IT techs) and my coworker comes in, he says “uhh, I was just downstairs helping [person] and I overhear SM going ballistic. She says ‘I am so sick of this IT department. They hire the most incompetent students possible. I don’t understand why it’s taken her 3 days to fix this f*cking printer. How hard can it possibly be?! I don’t even think she got me an actual new printer. And of course she had to ask [supervisor] for help because SHE DOESNT KNOW SHIT ABOUT PRINTERS!!! She’s too dumb to figure it out herself!’”

At this point I’m speechless. Not only did I get her a brand new printer when I didn’t have to, but I have been nothing but kind and apologetic to her. Yes, it wasn’t a quick fix. But guess what?! NOT MY FAULT. We all know tech has a mind of its own and sometimes things just don’t work out. 

So I’m incredibly pissed off but I found a solution to the issue (thank god for IT forums) and I go downstairs and install the printer correctly, test print, everything is fine. I say “I’m so sorry this has taken so long, everything that could’ve gone wrong did but it’s all working now!” She says “oh my, no apologies necessary at all. I know none of this is your fault. I really appreciate it.” Fake b*tch but anyway, I’m about to leave and her internet shuts off. Just completely stops working. I run the troubleshooter, try everything under my belt. I apologize again, tell her I’ll grab her a new network cable and see if that helps. She says “I know you’ll figure it out sooner or later” ugh. 

Luckily my coworker dealt with this exact issue before and knew what to do, so I fix it and again apologize cause it’s taken time away from her work. She says “seriously don’t worry about it, the world isn’t ending because my f*cking internet shut off. You’re fine.” 

So that was the end to my painful encounter with this woman. I cannot possibly believe why someone would have so much hatred towards a student worker making $13/hour, and I literally catered to her by myself, spent over 2 hours on Dell support chat, was incredibly nice to her the entire process. Some people are just incredibly entitled and think IT requires no critical thinking. F*ck you, SM.",talesfromtechsupport

We got a call one morning that one of the tables had mysteriously lost power, and they couldn't get any of the workstations running.  So, I head over with another tech to investigate, and when we arrive, there is a smell of burnt plastic in the air.  We both look at each other, and instantly dive under the table to see what was on fire.He was checking the PSUs on the workstations, while I focused on the surge protectors.

t3_cu2evm,Hammers and Nails,"So I work for a company that offers GPS/Logging solutions for commercial trucks. I work for the lowest, frontline tier of technical support, so we're basically the frontline. The technology we use is almost exclusively built and programmed in-house so we're constantly running into all sorts of weird issues that we only see once and we have nothing but hearsay and Slack to figure out what the hell arcane ritual the only other guy to get this issue used to fix it last time.

This was not one of those issues. It was one of the most basic goddamn issues that any computer trying to securely exchange data could have.

So I get an email from an administrator within a company wondering why the hell their Driver has working logs on their end but none of the logs are coming through and displaying on the admin's end. I see this and I know, ""Thank god, an easy one. It's probably a certificate issue. So either we need to fix the time on his display or have him log in and log out to have the driver's login re-authenticate back up with the main system.""

So I tell them, in more professional terms, that the driver's display probably has the wrong time on it. Have the driver call in and we can probably walk them through sorting out the issue pretty quick.

Apparently, this was not enough for the administrator on the other end. They took one look at my email, sent a long, ranting email over my head to their assigned customer manager about how incompetent I was and how this was clearly a communications issue with our servers and we needed to fix it.

The CM forwarded me the scathing email and tacked on their own message, ""Hello, please work as needed to provide a better explanation of this and how we can fix it.  Back office needs to be able to see logs on their end.""

So I put on my biggest rage-induced smile and started typing up a second email to the admin. I'm not exactly versed in the exact terminology and technology in how certificates work, but I assume, basically, they're just there as a way for two distant systems to securely handshake, verify they are who they say they are, and trade information.

So I typed up the most saccharine-sweet, detailed, and condescending email that opened with ""per my previous email"" on the workings of certificates(as much as I know), why they were important to information security, and slowly broke it down to why something as small as the time on the display might throw this off(as far as I could guess). I also included the three or four other less likely causes for the issue and broke down the why behind that and how those issues also would need to be fixed directly on the display.

I wrapped it up with, ""So per my previous email, it is most likely an issue with the time on the driver's display. Please have someone such as the driver or a technician with the display in front of them call in to troubleshoot the issue with us."" More or less ending with what I said last time.

It was satisfying to write from beginning to end, was dripping with condescension, and the best part is that it could also easily be interpreted as me just trying to be as helpful as possible as requested. I don't know about you guys, but about the only thing that makes my calm demeanor crack is when someone who knows absolutely nothing about how the technology works decides that I, who work with it for a living every day, somehow am incompetent and have no idea what I'm talking about.

I mean, yeah, okay, I'm not a goddamn software or network engineer here. But at the basest level, I know which hammer works best when slammed against the various nails jutting out.

**tl;dr:** Just me blowing off some steam about a customer who didn't think I knew what I was talking about, so they went over my head, the people over my head asked me to explain better, and I sent a ~~condescending~~ helpful email explaining in excruciating detail basically what I said last time.",talesfromtechsupport

One of the tools they support (let's call it H) is used by several thousand financial advisors across the country. (Fair warning: I don't work with H at all, so some details here might be slightly off)

There's been an issue for the past few weeks where advisors have been unable to log into H. This is a pretty big deal, and a ton of email has been flying around between the support department, the IT department that runs the servers, management on both ends, and probably a bunch of others trying to figure this all out. My boss gets cc'd on some of these, and about three weeks in he thinks to ask about the authorized users list. Apparently, there's a script that needs to be run occasionally to keep the authorized users up to date (something to do with annual training requirements), and that script had failed. So as users hit their yearly roll-over, they were considered out of date and were blocked from logging in. An IT department and a support department didn't know this, but my boss, the MBA, managed to pinpoint it pretty quickly when he started asking questions. So they fixed the script, and the big outage was over immediately.

Me: Ok Jane that isn't normal I'll be right down, what floor are you on?

After getting the details I went to her floor, I took the elevator down, when I came out of the lifts I didn't need to ask where she sat as the floppy drive was doing its best rendition of the drum solo from the song 'In the air tonight' she worked in a small office by herself but the noise was filling most of the floor.

As I arrived to Jane's desk I see two stacks of floppy disks one still in boxes and the other stacked on her desk, the stack on her desk was a pile of broken or warped floppy disks, I assumed they were damaged during storage and didn't ask about them (rookie mistake).

After 10 minutes of me going through my checklist (remember first day on the job) as well as trying to eject the floppy disk or get it t read, Jane starts getting frantic about the drives she tell me ""I've been doing this for hours now, some disks work but some don't I'm worried this drive is breaking these floppies and we don't have any other copies of this data""

Me: ""ok why would you say the drive is breaking them, how many floppies haven't worked?"" I pointed over to the pile of broken disks ""did the drive do this to all of the disks?""

Jane: Those are the ones that didn't work they were getting stuck but once I got them in the drive they came out fine, this is the first one I couldn't eject.

She was right the eject button was really stuck, I decided the safest method was to turn off the PC pull out the floppy drive and manually retrieve the disk.

Upon opening the drive (which took 25 minutes because I was new and really not confident on what I was doing) I finally figured out the issue, the floppy disk was not only back to front but also upside down.

Me: Jane can I ask how did you get this in the drive, its upside down and facing the wrong way?

Jane looks at me like I was exercising a demon from her body after the longest most awkward pauses ever she replies in a soft voice.

Jane: Floppy disks have a right and a wrong way to go into drives?

Me: .........Yes, I really don't understand how you got this in there like this can you show me.

Jane proceeds to pull out a small hammer from under her desk.

Jane: The disks that didn't go in correctly I used this to get them in the drive, why is IT equipment so complicated?

Me: I'm going to have to talk to my manager I'll be back soon.

I'm not exactly sure what happened to poor Jane, she was moved to a different section soon after, I still wonder sometimes if she is now chiselling in USB keys into PC's

t3_ctxq90,YOUR! Copier (email) is broken.,"TLDR: At the bottom.

I'm a tech for a copier company.  This is one of the first calls I went out on alone.

Doing the morning routines when i overhear my boss on the phone:  

""Alright, it went through.  I'll send a tech over now.""
""HEY!, MT (me).  I gotta call for you.  They cant scan.  Head over there.  Oh and take a drum and maybe a fuser too.  Their getting black lines.""

I do the needful things and head off.

The customer is a seed company.  Lots of dust in the air (which drives my nose and eyes bonkers).  I think to myself, ""the office should be better than outside.""  It's not.   The office is covered in dirt, and so is the copier.  I'm met by the ""IT Guy."":

""Hey MT I'm IT.  Your copier is really messed up.  It cant print.  Its copy is horrible.  And it won't scan.  You guys haven't taken care of it.  I mean, why do we even have a service contract.""

""Well sir I'm sorry to hear that.  I'll get it fixed up for you.""

The details:  the filthy copier is 10 years old and no longer supported by canon.  I spent about an hour cleaning/repairing.   And replaced every consumable (all were bad).

Moved onto the chargeable portion of the call next.  (Our contracts only cover the copier.  Networking is chargeable).  Decided to fix the printing problem next. But IT requests that I fix the scanning first.  

They scan via smtp using google.  After about 45 minutes of troubleshooting with IT breathing down my neck.  (On old canons to test the smtp you had to actually run a scan.  There was no test button on the rui as there is now).  I determined the cause of the problem.  The new SSL/TLS industry standards had just been implemented.  All major providers switched to the new standards.  And Canon didnt issue a firmware update to reflect the change on this dinosaur. 

I calmly explain this understandable truth to my fellow it professional.   To which IT responds:  ""But it worked just fine yesterday!""

It was at that point when I realized IT wasn't an IT Professional. 

I explain how smtp works.  What and how SSL communication is and works.  Why google won't change their settings to match his standards for his free gmail account.  I explain that Yahoo and Microsoft won't work either.  He responds by asking me to try Outlook.com.  I explain why that won't work.  He asks, ""what about live.com.""  I try that just to appease/crush his hubris.  

I then explained that we could simply use SMB scanning, but that it would need to be on a centralized computer for ease of use.  

""OH, We have a server!  Will that work!""

""F*ck YA IT, that should do the trick!""  (The polite cursing barrier had been crossed by about hour 2).  

IT takes me to the server room.  It's a Walmart box running Windows 10 home.  I ask IT, ""Who set this up?""  He responds proudly,""I Did!"" (Bet you didnt see that one coming).

IT explains that all the print jobs go to this PC and it can now serve as the SMB server too.  

I set up SMB shared folder and have to trek to the copier to test it.  IT wouldn't give me the password so I had him put it in.  3 times I tried to scan, and it failed.  Then I locked the computer and had him unlock it.  ""Oh, oops.  I guess I had the password wrong.""  We (I) get it working.

Everything is solved and I fill out the work order.  Present it to the boss and get an irate response.  

""YOURE CHARGING US???  I JUAT PAID YOU THIS MORNING.""  

""Did you get the email fixed?""  She, the boss, said with visible anger.

""The copiers email cant be fixed."" Said IT.

I explain.  ""The security standards have changed and the copiers out of tech support for canon.  They won't issue an update for the new standards.  But you're able to scan via a shar..."" She cut me off.

""You sold me a Lemon!""

I asked when they bought it.  10 years ago.  I dont respond to the lemon comment.

""I depend on my email scan.  WE NEED IT!""

""If you really want email scan you can pay for a private domain and use an unsecured port to scan from a custom domain.  I'm sure IT could set that up for you.""

""Ugh, ya. Ya I could probably do that.""

""I cant believe that x company would send a tech out that needs my IT to hold their hand.""

At this point I call my boss.  The conversation went like this:

MB is my boss.   BB is thier boss.

I explain to MB the nitty gritty.

MB: let me talk to her.

BB:  your copier is unfixable.  You've sold us a lemon.  The email is broken.

MB:  the copier is not broken.  The technology is just outdated.  My tech provided a way for you to scan.  If you want to email you'll have to setup a server or upgrade. 

BB:  ...pause...

BB:  Why would we upgrade when you let our machine go into disrepair?

MB:  the machine hasn't been serviced because you haven't paid us in over a year.

BB:  I just paid you today.

MB:  Try that with your phone company and see if you get service.

MB:  Look.  Here's a deal.  I'll write this charge call off if you promise to pay the monthly service rate on time.

BB:  Oh, ok.  We will thank you.

I move on to leave.  At the door IT stops me as I'm already halfway to the car.

""Hey, what about the printing problem?""

""Install all the print drivers locally on each PC.""

""Where are the drivers?""

""The internet.""  Shut car door and leave.

PS:  to add to this.  My boss leased a copier to another customer.  The owner of this company is the wife of the owner of the seed company.  We recently sued to get thier 2 years worth of lease payments.  I got the second hand telling of the spectacle the owner caused when he presented a check to MB for the 2 years of a 5 year lease.  With the checks memo reading ""paid in full.""  MB crossed that out and wrote, ""paid up to date.""

TLDR:  Customer who doesn't pay bill complains when we cut off service.  Then complains about getting charged to fix things that are out of the scope of the contract.  And one really stupid "" IT Guy.""",talesfromtechsupport

t3_ctnl24,"""Our scans take ages to arrive""","Company we're MSP for calls Tuesday morning.

Reygle: Business name, this is Reygle!

Supervisor: Morning, Reygle.  You helped us get our new copier all configured last week in the office, and now when we scan documents to our email accounts, they take upwards of 40 minutes to arrive.

Reygle: That's pretty odd, I know that none of your users agreed to use folders on your server for scans, and everyone wanted scans directly e-mailed to themselves-

Supervisor: We're never going to scan to folders.

Reygle: \**urge to off myself rising\** Yep, we talked about that.  I do recall sending a test email to every user we set up- and that most arrived within the minute. (There were 29 of them)

Supervisor: Yep! I was there with you, all went great.

Reygle: So now, the same types of scans are taking entire lunch breaks to arrive?

Supervisor: That's right.

\---------

*spends 3.5 hours remoted to the scanner's touch panel troubleshooting, as well as remote monitoring station staring at settings that aren't incorrect*

Finds *\*high compression setting we never set, disables it\**

*literally works perfectly every time I ask them to test scan 100 pages*

\---------

*Closes ticket*

45 minutes later:

Reygle: Company name, Reygle speaking!

Supervisor: Hi, scans were great for a bit, then I re-enabled high compression mode and they all slowed back down.

Reygle: Wait- **you RE-enabled** it?  Had you recently turned the feature on before you called with this problem?

Supervisor: ....

Why did you re-enable that?  The 800Mhz processor in your leased copier can't handle the workload while using OCR, which you *really* don't want to go without.  More than maybe 10 pages with that feature on will bring it to a crawl- it's not exactly an enterprise machine.

Supervisor: Oh.  I just scanned 273 pages.

Reygle: That'll arrive next week, maybe never.  Please power cycle the copier if anyone wants to use it for the rest of the day.  Next time you change settings and notice a difference, please let me know before I spend a whole morning billing you.

Supervisor: ...      *incredible pause*      So when I turned that on, I caused this problem?

Reygle: Yes.

Supervisor: What is this going to cost me?

Reygle: 3.5 hours at normal rate.

Supervisor: *longest pause I've ever witnessed in a phone call*  Do you think this is why our last copier was so slow? I had turned it on for that one, too.

Reygle: Have a nice day. *hang up and screams*

&amp;#x200B;

t3_ctv392,"Manager wanted the impossible, then gets shutdown","Hey just wanted to share another story that kinda frustrated me but working in IT department you get allot of complaints that could be easily fixed &amp; then you hear the annoying "" IT staff are dumb they don't know shit"". Ofc you work your usual hours &amp; if you go the extra steps you won't get anything in return just more work and no bonus or overtime. Yes no overtime for IT is crazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is a problem with the IT department honestly but it is because management keeps saying ""Just do it, but I can't accept this cost"". So most of the things we have are based on the little budget we have available. So when the staff ask for tasks that require things over the budget they usually just regret"". Sometimes other departments do something on their own and they cause malware or get infected with ransom ware locking essential files that should be sent to the government, otherwise there would be a fine. The dumb people don't even have back ups. So yea dealing with such people is tiresome. Anyways one of the managers wanted other systems to communicate with each other. That is a problem since some of our software are not compatible or are decades old. So usually is not supported anymore. Upgrading those software will cost millions. I found entire eco systems that are cost effective and are up to date &amp; can do all the things we want.""

&amp;#x200B;

My manager said "" Why would we go for a Camry when we have a Ferrari"" .

Basically my manager wanted the Ferrari 2019 without the cost. So all the alternatives are bad to him.

I was confused I said in my mind "" we have a Ferrari on life support  &amp; fixing that Ferrari cost us millions""

I replied "" Well our current Ferrari cannot do what you ask, a new Ferrari cost x10 the cost of this software, so you have a choice of either choosing this alternative, getting the new Ferrari or just decline your request. I just want you to know that this isn't IT department fault this is your decision after all. So do not blame IT""

The manager said "" You know what I like our existing system, yea I won't ask you to do that task"".

Update: just remembered this. You see I work in IT not only as designer, consultant, web developer but also as system analyst. So usually I talk to the team and we make plans for the projects. One of the managements decided to outsource a system using a different language that is ill informed of our existing systems and requirements. The COO gave me the lead first I talked to my team and asked the correct questions. Also made appointment with our department with workflows ready so that they understand our current system and where the data is fed from. Some software are required and cannot be replaced so a connector is mandatory. I talked to the sales people "" yes the COO of my company and sales person from outsourcing company never allowed me to communicate with developers directly"". What is worse is that the sales person did not have the skills to understand or reply to my questions or understand our systems. The sales team did not like to talk to me cause I talked specifics. I also found their flaws and COO got angry with them and shouted "" you do not tell us how we do our business"". That is because the sales team weren't good with communication. 

I'm not bashing sales people most sales people I met are great and well informed of their own services, they are also good listeners. This company however had bad sales team. 

I told COO "" can I please talk to developers directly, I think there is a language barrier, I want to talk to a developer""

My COO basically removed me and in fact removed all IT from our company to look into this project. So the only communication is between outsourcing company and COO directly. My IT manager said wise words "" Quote him and post this date, so that if he tries to blame this on us you will remind him that it was his decision to exclude IT team from responsibility"".",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cts70n,"Lying won’t get you anywhere, kid.","Obligatory “I’m on mobile so excuse any formatting weirdness but I tried my best.”

So I work in a store for a major wireless carrier in the US. My job is primarily sales, but we do get tech support requests from time to time. These run the gamut from pretty basic stuff like doing a soft reset or (my personal favorite) flipping the silent switch on the side of an iPhone, to more involved things like signal issues and devices not powering on. Anyways, onto the story!

A woman came in with her teenage son. She had just bought him a new phone a few months prior as a birthday gift. According to the son, he put it on the charger when he went to bed and it wouldn’t power on in the morning. I did some basic troubleshooting like trying a few different cables and cleaning any dust or funk out of the charging port. Still nothing. Phone won’t even acknowledge that it’s plugged in. Oh, bother.

The phone was still under warranty, and at this point that looked like the next step in my process. Now the warranty does not cover physical or liquid damage, and if the customer sends back the device and the warehouse finds any damage they will be charged a fee for it.

As the woman and I wait on hold for tech support- we aren’t able to do warranty replacements in carrier stores- I inspect the phone a bit more closely. The son swears up and down that there was no damage to the phone and it didn’t come into contact with any liquid, but I still have to check for any and all damage. No damage to the body or screen, buttons feel nice and clicky...but there’s condensation on the rear camera. I open the SIM tray and shine a flashlight into the phone, and what do you know- the water damage indicator is a nice shade of pink. It’s supposed to be white. Yup, definitely water damage. Oh, bother...again.

I explain this to the woman- who is still on hold by the way- and she doesn’t believe me at first. I show both her and her son the condensation in the rear camera, as well as the indicator inside of the phone. Sorry, it’s water damage. Warranty won’t cover it. 

I can tell she’s mad, but less at me and more at the situation and her son. I press him a little more, asking if he could think of any possivle way the phone would have gotten wet, even if it was just condensation. Turns out he got into a fight with some kids at his school and they shoved him into a snowbank when his phone was in his pocket. The phone got wet, his ass got wet, and his ego likely got a bit bruised.

The woman look at him and said “Oh, that’s fine. Things happen. Tell you what; I have my old flip phone back at the house somewhere. We can just activate that for you to use.” In my neck of the woods, giving a flip phone to a high schooler is apparently tantamount to a big red A on their shirt, to reference one of my least favorite books I had to read when I was in high school.

TL;DR: Kid lied to his mom about water damage on his shiny new phone. The phone stopped working and the truth eventually came out. Now he has a flip phone that might be as old as he is.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ctfu4g,PC keeps turning off (sure we've all run into this one),"Hi all, no pre-amble, I'll get straight onto the story.

Working in IT, got a call from a user saying their PC keeps turning off.  Asked the usual questions to work out if the PC is shutting down, or is it the screen going blank, etc.  End result of the conversation was that the PC was cutting out completely and needed powering back on via the On/Off button.

I headed up the two flights of stairs to the user expecting a loose power cable, but once under the desk I was surprised to find the power cable nice and secure.  Then looked at dust build up and fans thinking overheating, but everything seems to be fine.

I asked if there's any pattern to the cut outs - does it happen when using a particular application, or at particular times of the day, etc.  She says no, but after a bit of prodding says it often happens after she catches the PC with her foot.

Thinking maybe an internal loose connection, I give the PC a few shakes and a few taps around the case but the PC remains quietly well behaved.  I tell her it seems to be working fine.  She then says ""No, it's happens when I catch it with my foot...""

**SMACK**

From out of nowhere, she kicks the PC so hard I thought she was trying to clear a goal kick into the opponents half!  Sure enough, the PC cuts power, and she looks very happy she's been able to demonstrate the problem.

I tell her PCs are not designed to take that kind of punishment and it's no wonder it's shutting down!  I then get back under her desk and move the PC and cables to the other side, so it's behind her drawer unit and not in the area her feet are.  I show her where the PC is now, and say this should solve it as she now cannot catch it with her feet.

""Oh, no.  I can't have it there.  Where am I going to rest my feet?!?!""

""You shouldn't be using your PC as a foot rest!  How about we get you an actual foot rest?""

""No, the foot rests are too low.  The CPU is just the right height.  Put it back.""

After shuddering that she's referring to her base unit as her 'CPU', I inform her that the PC is staying where I've put it, I'm ordering her a foot rest and she will just have to learn to live with it.

Had a request a few weeks later from her boss to 'Put her tall foot rest back where she can use it"", so had to call them and explain what the situation actually was - boss had a good laugh and told me he'd sort it out with her.  Never heard anything more from either of them.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT** \- Wow!  Thank you very much for the Silver. :)  There are a LOT more comments than I was expecting, so apologies if I don't respond to yours but I promise I will read them all.

For those understandably questioning why IT is involved in getting a foot rest, my job at the time was the on-site IT/odd-job person and there was no actual role profile, so I'd spend my time repairing PCs, building Excel spreadsheets for management information collation, making PowerPoint presentations for the Centre Manager, ordering supplies for anything that didn't fall under the title of stationery (mice, keyboards, monitors, foot stands, wireless mics and speakers), and anything else that didn't fall into someone else's job title and could be badged as 'IT related' by top management.  Fun times and I learned a little about a lot of subjects.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cthwic,The black marks are there for a reason.," I don't know if this is exactly the right place for this but I guess the comments will decide.

Background: Back in the early '90s I was a computer programmer for the army and one of my duties was to maintain systems that transferred officer and enlisted records from my duty station up to and down from the department of the army. These records were the changes to soldier’s personnel files and were pretty important because they would not get paid for new ranks if finance in D.C. wasn’t aware of their promotions.

The system we had to use was a few years old and worked fine (but very slow), the problem we had was that the phone lines in our building were VERY old. So old that they still used cloth rather than rubber as insulation and were very finicky in how they had to be kept for them to work properly. We had so many problems with keeping the phone lines working that the computer was kept in a certain location and never moved or the connection would not work due to the physical stress the phone line was under (its own weight) and we couldn’t connect to D.C.

The story: I was but a lowly E-4 Specialist (SPC) and worked by myself downstairs as the 2 E-5’s had moved on to other bases and their replacements had not yet arrived to replace them. The fact that 2 SPCs (there was another SPC downstairs doing a different, very easy job, as he was waiting to be medically discharged) were working unsupervised downstairs really got on the nerves of a E-6 Staff Sergeant (SSG) upstairs who didn’t have a whole lot of work after I had created a program that did 90% of his previous work. Since this SSG now had much less work to do he was forced by our E-7 Sergeant First Class (SFC) to assist in the data entry section which I think he was not happy with.

The SSG talked with our SFC and had the great idea that he should spend ½ his time supervising me and the other SPC who worked downstairs because ofcourse 2 SPC can’t be trusted not to f things up. As a SPC I had no say in the matter so I now had a SSG supervising me that had no IT experience and no understanding of the weird issues we had with the wiring downstairs.

Well of course once the SSG began his supervisory role downstairs his first order of business was to move everything around to suit whatever vision he had of how the furniture should be set up. The other SPC and I began moving the heavy as hell desks around in a way that the SSG had told us to until it came to moving the desk with the data transfer computer. This desk was against the wall with permanent marker where the legs should be, electrical tape on the desk to mark where the computer should be, and was never to be moved because of the wiring issue. I informed the SSG that if this computer was moved at all I did not think I would be able to connect to D.C. to do our data transfers. The SSG was not impressed with my explanation and forced us to move the desk while I once again told him this was a bad idea. He also had us try and clean the floor and desk of the permanent marker, but we were unable to full get it clean (thankfully).

Over the next week and a half I had to report to our SFC every afternoon that we were having comms issues and were unable to transfer our daily updates. When Thursday of the second week came around our SFC came into our section and wanted an update on our comms issues as we were missing over a week’s worth of updates as well as our “large” monthly download of records they needed upstairs to update their systems. I tried to explain that the issue was with the location of the computer, and the stress on the old wiring, but I was interrupted by the SSG that I complaining too much about the issue (which of course I did as I knew how to fix the issue I had to report everyday) and I needed to just do my job and fix the problem. The SFC told me to just fix the problem and I started doing everything I knew how to over the next few hours to try and get the computer to connect. None of it worked, and at the end of the day I had to once again report that we were unable to send data.

On the next morning the SSG and SFC came down stairs and the SSG started to tear into me about how I was a shitty “computer guy” and how it shouldn’t take almost 2 weeks to fix a simple issue with a computer. After being told I was basically a P.O.S. for 10 minutes, I got pissed, snapped, and I told the SSG off and that this issue was completely his fault and that I was F’n done with his crap and then walked out to the front of the building. This kind of thing would, in most cases, have caused me to get in a lot of trouble and probably even lose a rank or 2. My SFC came out to the front of the build and asked me WTF was going on as I was not known for being disrespectful to leadership and I explained to him that all the issues I had to report to him every day were caused by the SSG moving “that god damn transfer computer”.

The SFC decided to let me prove my point and asked the SSG to go back upstairs (which he smugly did as he knew the failure was because I didn’t know what I was doing) while telling me to get the computer working in any way I needed to. I knew that if I was unable to fix it that it would be my ass on the line. I asked the other SPC to help me move the desk and computer back into its original location and line it up with the marks on the floor and push the computer into the marks on the desk as it had been located in the past. 10, very stressful, minutes later I was transferring the last weeks’ worth of data up to D.C. (after f’n with that god damned phone line for a bit) and preparing to download the needed data (which we usually did over night as it was very large for the time and the data rates were very slow). I then went upstairs and reported to my SFC that comms were back up and by that afternoon we should have the files needed to update their systems.

The other SPC and I spent the rest of the time I was in that unit unsupervised downstairs, the permanent marker was redrawn on the desk and floor, and the SSG continued to do data entry upstairs with the SFC.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ctl65f,A few short stories from a previous workplace that I miss dearly.,"I assisted the IT guy, John, at an elementary school for a while. John was both a teacher and head of IT, so he didn't always have time for support. Here I met Kevin. Kevin was also a teacher and technically challenged.

Kevin needed to print something, but the toner filter was full. The staff are supposed to call John or me to service the printers. Kevin didn't want to wait, so he found a *screwdriver* and tried replacing the filter himself. Kevin and the small room where covered in black toner powder. I explained to him that printers don't need screwdrivers for this sort of thing.

He learned nothing from this. Some time later, he needed to print again, but the printer was out of yellow ink. This printer used long, see-through cylinders full of colored powder. Again, he didn't want to wait, so he pulled out the yellow ink cylinder and tried inserting a new one. It didn't fit, because he grabbed the wrong one; it was for a different model of printer. So, Kevin *kicked it in*. Kevin and the small room were covered in yellow powder. Luckily, the printer wasn't damaged and John told Kevin not to try anything like this again.

Another time, Kevin came into my office with an external hard drive he had brought from home. It wasn't working and he asked me to look at it. Right away, I noticed that he had brought the wrong power supply for the drive. I mentioned this and he said that this was the power supply that came with it. It clearly wasn't, since the drive had the Western Digital logo on it, and the power supply said Toshiba on the back. He still wasn't convinced and we went back and forth a little bit, until John came in and assured Kevin that I was correct. Anyway, I opened up the external casing, but couldn't see any damage. I tried hooking it up to my laptop with a SATA to USB adapter, but I got no reaction. I could only assume that it was fried, because he used the wrong power supply.

Otherwise, Kevin was a pleasant enough guy and we got along well, when he wasn't wrecking electronics.

I was only hired for a year, to assist John setting up new equipment and preparing most of the building for an updated IT system, since he didn't have the time to do both that and teach. It was probably the best job I've ever had. Plenty to do and wonderful, appreciative people. I really miss it.

**Edit**: Thank you for all your stories. I just remembered something funny I would like to add. Early one morning, a teacher called me saying that the smart-board in her classroom wasn't working. It was one of those touch-sensitive whiteboards that plugs into a computer. The screen is projected onto the whiteboard, so you can ""draw"" on the screen with your fingers. Anyway, class was starting in 15 minutes, so I ran down there to try and fix it in time.

Nothing I did seemed to help. I restarted, updated drivers, checked calibration, force closed and restarted the software, but got nowhere. Then class begins and all the kids start filing in and sitting down. I'm fiddling away like mad, because the teacher was so nice and friendly and I really wanted to help her. Then one boy comes up to me and asks me what I'm doing.

""Your smart-board isn't working right and trying to fix it. Looks like I'm not going to make it in time for your class, hehe.""

""Did you try unplugging the USB cable and plugging it back in?""

I actually facepalmed hard, in front of the whole class and asked the boy to try it. Lights flashed and a message popped up saying that the smart-board was connected. I did a quick test and told the boy he did a good job, then left the classroom in literal shame.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cta49g,You can not use the help desk to order cake,"I like to bake. I'm willing bake something for going away parties, Halloween, or what have you, and it's something I'm pretty decent at. I like to show that I'm not just the IT guy, but that I'm a well rounded person when the occasion calls for it. The last time I baked something, it was for a going away party for a coworker I actually liked. [It was a coconut cake, made from scratch, with seven minute frosting.](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/coconut-cake-with-7-minute-frosting-recipe-1953530) This cake takes four hours to make, and I only made it because I knew that she loved it and she was headed off to Hawaii. Thematically appropriate, I'd say.

Today I got a help desk ticket to bake a coconut cake because they ""haven't had one in a while.""

I thought they were asking for another coworker who's leaving soon, she's not from that department, no one in that department likes her, and she doesn't like coconut. I like her just fine so she's getting banana pudding.

t3_ctboii,"Please don't tell my boss, but something happened to my laptop","It’s almost lunchtime at the $Hosptial helpdesk. I could barely hear the phone ringing over my stomach rumbling. I’m busy battling Chipolte’s website to get some lunch, so Hippie answers the phone for me.

&gt;Hippie: IT, this is Hippie.

&gt;Caller: Hi, this is Melissa from $RemoteOffice. I have a problem with my computer and I was hoping you could help me fix it ASAP

&gt;Hippie: OK, no worries, what’s up?

&gt;Caller: Uh…I don’t know how to say this, but I think I broke it. 

&gt;Hippie: What do you mean, broke your computer? What’s wrong with it? You can’t login?

&gt;Caller: No, it will barely do anything at all?

&gt;Hippie: That sucks. What happened to it?

&gt;Caller: Well, my cat walked across the keyboard and now it’s not working very well

&gt;Hippie: Hahaha, yeah man, my cats do that all the time. We should be able to fix it no problem. Are you locked out of your account now or???

&gt;Caller: No, the keyboard doesn’t seem to be working quite right. Some of the keys look funny now

&gt;&gt;Hippie: Uh, man, that really doesn’t sound like an easy fix. If you can give me a few minutes, I’ll figure out something and call you back.

&gt;Caller: Oh dear, I was hoping you guys could just fix it now. I’d rather my boss not find out. She would be really mad. I might just keep using it. It still kinda works, but it’s hard to type.

&gt;Hippie: No worries, we should be able to figure something out very soon. I’ll call you back ASAP.

&gt;Caller: Oh great, thanks. The sooner the better, I really don’t want my boss to find out.   *click*

Hippie fills me in and we decide, heck with it. We grab a new laptop and get it imaging. Whatever happened to her laptop, we don’t have any parts on hand, and they’re not going to wait for parts to be ordered in.

That much of the situation sorted, Hippie calls her back

&gt;Hippie: Hi Melissa, this is Hippie from IT. Just calling back to get some more info on your laptop. We’re working on a solution as we speak; just wanted to make sure i’m on the right track.

&gt;Melissa: Oh that’s great. I’ll do whatever I can to help. What sort of info did you need?

&gt;Hippie: Well, first off, what kind of laptop is it?

&gt;Melissa: It’s a Dell

Big oof. Any Dells we had were close to ten years old. It’s way past the refresh cycle. Now there’s no doubt that replacing it was the right move.

&gt;Hippie: OK thanks, that’s just what I need to know. We can’t do anything to fix it, but we can, uh, loan you another one, if you want to stop by today and get it. Now I really gotta ask, what exactly happened to it?

Unfortunately for Hippie, we didn’t get a straight answer, but not long after that, Melissa showed up with an elderly Dell Lattitude that was missing several keys and generally looked like it lost a fight with every sledgehammer ever made. 

She seemed nervous and was very reticent to accept her “loaner” laptop until I labeled it “MELISSAS LOANER LAPTOP”. Somehow that sticker made everything OK and she left with her new laptop.

Melissa’s job meant that she worked very closely with her boss, so her boss found out about the new laptop in about 2 seconds. Boss lady called, more curious than anything, and we explained that Melissa’s elderly laptop had met its fate and we’d replaced it. Boss lady was entirely unperturbed by this news. Being as IT savvy as she was, boss understood that fixing aged computers was pointless. I'm sure it helped that Corporate paid for the replacement since it was overdue...

A few weeks later, Hippie was helping Melissa again and ended up speaking with Melissa’s husband. It seems she needed our help but couldn’t get to the phone. Over the course of the conversation, her husband tells Hippie all the details Melissa left out of the laptop saga. It seems that Melissa had been working from home that day and had placed her running laptop on a very high shelf so she could take a break. Cat jumps on the shelf and lands on the laptop. Laptop and cat take a tumble six feet to the tile floor. Voila, one very startled cat and one very shattered laptop.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ctegli,Explaining how scheduling of TV-shows work,"I apologize in advance for any spelling errors. English isn't my first language.


I work 1. Line support at an ISP which also provides a TV solution similar to cable, but transmitted through the Internet.


A woman called in to notify us about a problem with one of the channels we provide (not unusual. Our service is pretty New, so there are some faults with induvidual channels that We're working om to fix).


The conversation went like this (paraphrased):


Me: Welcome to $ISP, my name is Ayybrul how may I be of assistance.


Woman: Hi! There's an issue with one of the channels on your service.


Me: Allright, which channel is it and what's the issue?


Woman: $Channel is stuck on just one programme, it never changes!


This seems like a weird problem to have. At first I'm thinking she's unable to change the channel, but she assures me she is able to do that. The only issue is the one channel which is stuck sending bridal dresses for the past 3 days straight (according to the customer).


Me: We have a TV-set installed in our break area. You would you mind holding the line for a moment while I double check if this is an issue with the channel on all devices, or just yours?


Woman: Of course not! Go ahead, I'll Wait.


I walk over to the TV, open up the TV-guide, and sure enough. $channel has been sending the same show for quite a while with no other shows in between. But this is obviously how the channel set up the schedule, not an issue in itself.


I head on back to inform the customer of this.


Me: I'm back again, Thanks for waiting. It seems like this is how $channel decided to plan their scheduling. It's not an issue on our or your end.


Woman: Are you joking?? Who in their right mind would want to watch people try on dresses for hours on end??


Me: I'm afraid I'm serious. I can only reccomend you find another channel to watch while waiting for other shows to be scheduled.


Woman: Oh trust me I will! Thanks for the help!

One of our testers never restarts her machine because she doesn't want to lose her scripts. At the time of this incident, we had a new one prepped to switch out for her as she'd been complaining about everything being slow and the machine locking up and forcing a restart. Of course, I'd take a look and find the system completely locked up as a result of just how much she had running and open at once. I explained that she'd need to restart the machine and she lost it; she started yelling at me about how she shouldn't have to restart because she had all these scripts open that she'd written. I explain that there's no other choice as the entire system had locked up completely and she would need to reopen the saved versions...

Tester: ""What saved versions!? I don't save these; that's why I just keep the tabs open!""Me: ""Wait what? What do you do when there's an update that requires a restart?""Tester: ""I just don't update!""Me: ""... Okay, then. Well, I suggest you start saving your work from time to time until we get your new one and finish setting it up.""Tester: ""And what do I do in the meantime!?

t3_ct0dbm,The unsecured desktop...,"Back story- I was in the army, working IT. I wore many hats to include network/systems security. This was a time before WSUS and before Window 2000 became mainstream on my network. The network was scanned with Harris Technologies Retina auditing software, which produced ""bad system"" reports that fingered out systems that needed to be ""hand stroked"" (patched) into compliance. We used Dameware (loved it) at the time to remote in and work the systems. Computer security was not really taken seriously. We tried to educate our users, but fell on blind eyes and deft ears. Until one day..

me- I was cruising through the audit report, working systems. I'd ID a system, send a message to the system instructing the user to log out and allow me to take control of the system to do the update. I would also ""fish bowl"" (watch the remote system for activity) when I did this. One particular system I sent off the message, no response. The system was logged in and on a desktop. I went back to the other 3 systems I had open and worked them before coming back to this one.  Still no activity. Hmmm... It belongs to Col. Jones.. Let's take a look at his email.. Hmmm.. Not set up.. I call the POC number for this user. Rang 5 times and went to voice mail. I call someone in his office to see if he's around. ""No, he's over at the hangar for the day and his door is locked"" was the response. Ooook.. I configured his email and started composing an email..  Subject: I left my computer unsecured. ""I left my computer unsecured. I know this is a dumb move but I did it.  Someone could have used my unsecured computer to give my entire staff the day off, cursed out a general, or emailed the supply section to order 10,000 gallons of rocky-road ice cream. A lot of damage could have been done, just because I did not lock my computer.""  Ok.. Not too harsh.. Lets add snuffy's ""100 closest friends"". Letsee.. Yep. Send it to all of his colonel buddies, the 1 star, the 2 star, and my big boss.

Big wig meetings were held once a week. Every one of those colonels will be at that meeting, to include Snuffy. Tomorrow was the next meeting..  My big boss goes to these meetings and was already prepared with his response. The meeting starts and this email is at the top of the list of things to discuss.

Jones- (holds up a printed copy of the email) I want to know who did this. I want action taken against this individual and I want them punished. 

Boss- Why punish him? He was doing his job. You left your computer wide open and worse could've been done than just sending a email to everybody here.  You should probably thank him for not ordering 10,000 gallons of ice cream. 

Jones- I did secure my computer! I locked my office door and walked out!

Boss- Uh, no. You left your desktop unsecured. SGT. Snuffy did not need a key to your office. The network connection bypassed your physical security. You could have had armed guards posted at your office door and this still would've happened. Every body at this table needs to understand cyber security and be aware of it. I'm not punishing him for your failure.

(I was punished, sort of. I ended up having to give cyber security awareness class for NCODP and later ODP. It was a PowerPoint presentation with question/answer time afterwards. As an exit prize, participants received a home-use check list and CD containing anti-virus software, registry cleaners and malware scrubbers. Units were made aware that there is someone lurking around in the network, checking and securing it.)",talesfromtechsupport

t3_cssnbs,How to run a business in 2019,"So my parents owned a baby goods retailer for the last 15 years, they have since sold it and are much happier with the reduced stress.

During that time they moved from being a purely bricks and mortar store with traditional leaflet marketing to an online store with an online marketing as well a bricks and mortar store.

They brought me along for the ride and I built and maintained anything remotely related to IT. Restarting the router, keeping the internet and phones running, printer troubleshooting, that was me. Running cat6 cable, installing file servers, and security cameras, yup me. Building a website, managing the web and email hosting, installing a speaker intercom system, you guessed it.

After they sold the business I was free. But so that the person coming after me wouldn't be completely lost I wrote a handover document on how everything had been set up as well a password vault with any relevant information they would need. This included the config of the business grade fiber connected to a pfsense box i built.

I get a call from the new business owner about 6 months after the handover. Internet has been down for 5 days, he doesn't know what is happening and is far from a digital native. Being nice I helped out as much as i could over the phone, restart this, try that. Ultimately i couldn't help much over the phone. Wished them luck recommended they call the ISP.

Cut to a week later, I get a call from a tech they had hired asking for guidance on how the network had been set up. Turns out the reason the internet stopped working was they didn't like paying $850/month for business fiber and canceled the service. They forgot to order a replacement service though. Funny how the internet stops working for 2 weeks when disconnected. When they finally got the replacement service they opted for ADSL at a location that will be lucky to get 5Mbps/0.1Mbps. Have fun running your online business.

I later found out through the grape vine they had fired there digital marketing firm, turns out online isn't their focus anymore. They decided to spend the extra money on letter box leaflets. Physical leaflets dropped en masse in a neighborhood. Their clientele are new parents aged 20-35. Let that sink in.

t3_csil00,"The ""$10,000"" cardboard box","Years ago I worked tech support for a company that made an automotive scanner that ran software similar to a dealer tool for multiple car lines, they broke somewhat frequently, and we offered loaners for units coming in for repair. Our one requirement was that the shop had to give us a tracking number that said their unit was picked up by ups/fedex/etc. first.

Also relevant to the story is that when we sell the tool it comes in a hard, laser cut foam lined case. The scanners are pretty beefy themselves, I've had to destroy them before disposal before (proprietary stuff they'd like to make as difficult as possible to recover) and it took some WORK, so even in the poorest of packing conditions these scanners don't get physically damaged, the cases are mostly for storage and transporting so nobody absentmindedly drops a spanner on the screen.

One day, Bob calls (not his real name, I don't even remember it). He needs a loaner for his busted unit, we give him the standard ""send us a tracking number"" line. No word for a few days, ticket is still open, another call from Bob.

Bob: ""Where's my loaner?""  
Me: ""I apologize, we never received any tracking info on your unit, was it sent out?""  
Bob: ""No, I haven't shipped it, I was waiting until I got my loaner.""  
Me: ""I understand, however in order for a loaner to be sent (yada yada)""  
Bob: ""I need that loaner sent pronto.""  
Me: ""Certainly, I'll ensure it's sent overnight as soon as we receive your tracking info.""

He inevitably hangs up, grumbling, and we don't hear from him until the next week.

Bob: ""Why haven't I gotten my loaner yet? Do you realize how much work I've lost because I don't have that damn loaner? You've cost me over $10,000!""  
Me: ""Well, We never got any tracking info. Has your unit been shipped?""  
Bob: ""No, I keep telling you I'll ship it as soon as I get the loaner! You can trust me!"" (fat chance)  
Me: ""If your scanner doesn't work and you're losing ten grand in jobs why not just send us your broken scanner?""  
Bob: ""Well, I want to send it back with the box you guys send out.""  
Me: ""We send loaners in a cardboard box and some bubble wrap. Are you saying you lost $10,000 because you didn't want to spend $5 on a cardboard box and some bubble wrap?""

Silence as the gears turned on the other side of the line. He eventually realized how bad he fucked up,

He asked about the hard cases we send new tools in, and I had to explain that they were heavy, bulky, and expensive to ship, so we don't bother with them on loaners, they easily weigh 10 lbs on their own.

SLG: the... oh... did you do anything after turning the server on?

George: Yes sir! I was going through the booklet that was in the box with the server, but got a little stuck on one of the questions and now I'm calling you to help me out.

SLG: That was not what we discussed two days ago. Can you do me a favor and restart the server, NOT saving any changes if prompted from whatever screen you're in?

George: It says, 'unable to find boot menu'... Did I do something bad? :(

Yes Georgie, yes you did. Good ol' boy managed to reformat the hard drives, wiping out our OS install, and due to my company policies with ""proprietary information"" being what it is, we couldn't send him a copy of the ISO to re-install it. He had to box up his (~70 lbs) server and ship it half way across the country for us to re-load the OS and then ship it back to him.

He learned his lesson and called us before he even unboxed it the second time round though!",talesfromtechsupport
t3_csebai,Support asks if the landline I'm calling from is connected,"I work in IT and I mostly work behind the scenes but sometimes I do get requests from help desk and I go there to assist. Also when I come home my family and relatives keep pushing me to help them fix their issues. So this time there is an issue with my parents ISP provider. The router needs to be refreshed from ISP side. Is a fibre modem, so usually the same box supports phone line and internet. Only issue was internet. I talked to support using the land line cause they usually ask if I want support I should use same landline.

The the person in the phone line must have been tired or something cause he confused the fuck out of me. 

I usually did the basic steps before I made the call. Checking config page testing if it is from our side or their side. Checking if turning it off for 10 minutes. Nothing fixed it, so I made the call. I told the person my steps.

Support: ""Is the telephone line connected""

Me: ""umm yes, do you mean this telephone line that I'm using to call you that is connected to fibre modem""

Support: "" yes, check if cable is connected properly""


Me confused "" do you mean ethernet cable connected to router or th telephone line. Cause I'm calling you on this line. Is there any other telephone line I'm not aware off. ""

Support "" yes remove the telephone cable and put it back again ""

Me confused "" ummm the telephone would be disconnected, you are aware of that right? You want me to contact you again after I disconnect. Also issue is with internet not telephone so I'm confused""

Support "" can you please do that please""

Me "" okay *click""

I redial 

Support ""hello sir seems like the telephone is working fine now""

I did the biggest facepalm in my life.

I said "" What do you mean telephone is working fine it was already working fine. I called you using the same line. The problem is with the internet not telephone. Can you please just make sure to check the issue""

Support "" okay sir , I didn't know""

Me "" okay just please lets move on. I already told you the steps I have taken, what else can you do. Maybe check on your side or send staff if the problem is with the line itself""

t3_cshbss,"I didn't change the password, you did!","Recap for those of you who don't know; I'm a technical advisor for CCTV products which includes a lot of IT. Most of our customers have adequate IT-knowledge to being able to do their job (general IT knowledge such as understanding subnet masks, use of PCs, etc etc) but the small percentage does not.

Backstory;

Customer calls me and tells me one of his cameras is broken. I tell him to send the device to me first before shipping it over to RMA so I can have a closer look. I check the device, I find out the firmware got corrupted (probably caused by a bad file). I flash the device, works again, nice and dandy, I reset the device and send it back over to him.

2 weeks later I get a call.

Me: Me - Customer:HiDoggy!

&gt;**Me:** Hello, Me speaking.  
&gt;  
&gt;**HiDoggy!**: Yes, hello Me, how do I access the webpage of the device?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Oh, you just log onto the default IP-address of the camera. It's x.  
&gt;  
&gt;**HiDoggy!**: I did... It's not working.  Did you send me a broken camera?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Strange... No, let me check through teamviewer please.

I teamviewer his PC and see that he's connected to the webpage.

&gt;**Me:** Okay. Well, the webpage is working, right?

&gt;**HiDoggy!:** No, no it's not.

&gt;**Me:** Me? When did I do that?  
&gt;  
&gt;**HiDoggy!:** When the camera was sent to you!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:**  I definitely reset the device. Standard practice for us.  
&gt;  
&gt;**HiDoggy!:** No no, it  was like this when I already got it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Sir, I guarantee you, I did not change your password. The device should prompt an initialisation process that tells you to put in a password yourself.  
&gt;  
&gt;**HiDoggy!:** I...uh... No, you changed the password!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Did you get a prompt to do so?  
&gt;  
&gt;**HiDoggy!:** I don't remember. But you definitely changed the password! The device went to you!

&gt;**Me:** Look, once again, I guarantee you that I did not. Well, I did to tes-  
&gt;  
&gt;**HiDoggy!:** Aha, see? So type in the password you changed it to.

t3_cslr5i,Need help with wifi... but don't have a wifi adapter.,"So I got a call from a friend who wanted their PC to connect to their network with wireless... except they had no wireless card. I provided them with some spares that I had and they went back to their PC.

So, a little while later, I get another call asking for help with installing the card. I explained the need to remove the blanking plate and slot a card that matched into the motherboard slot. They did that and powered up their machine, but we couldn't see the card. It wasn't in Device Manager, so I suggested that either the card wasn't fully inserted, it was a dead card, or there was a fault with the motherboard. They checked, and found the card wasn't fully home, so we tried again, but still, no Wireless card in the Device Manager.

The PC ended up on my desk... the blanking plate had been removed, but from the card, and the card was inserted the wrong way round!

To my amazement, when I turned the card around it worked and I demonstrated wifi access to a relieved user.

HS: Tech, there is something wrong with my email. Come look at this.

I go there and of course I am getting the message that their email box is getting full. Now I know this user is a habitual hoarder. See gets an email about an order for a product and prints it out then files away both the printout and the email (just in case) into a plethora of sub-folders in her inbox based on customer name, product request and customer's shoe sizes. (OK maybe not but I can't make sense of the complex menagerie of folder hell.)

Me: It appears that you are reaching the 10GB limit on your email box. You have to delete somethings.

HS: What? No! I have to have all of this what if the user needs to know what they ordered last year at this time?

Me: Could you not just look in the ordering system to pull up their orders?

HS: Yes, but I have to keep this just in case. Can I copy this off to a server or someplace?

t3_csg6ca,customer has as much money as stubbornness,"I work at a small telecom company and we provide copper lines that we offer DSL &amp; phone over or in new areas (that we are still expanding) we offer speeds upwards of 1gig (if the customer can pay we offer faster but have to strike up a special deal. I once saw a host running 10gig with a specialized ONT and IMac).  At the time of the story I have been working at *ISP* just over a year. I’ve been studying Net+ since its directly related to my job and I am decently knowledgeable when it comes to networking and my job is spread wide enough I have to do some things that would be considered higher tiers or even sys.admin.

But at *ISP* we have one tier total for all calls and if you don’t bug sys.admin the more they like you. Especially when you thoroughly document and provide information. Which in this particular case I did. Repeatedly. This customer I dealt with is one if you say the name aloud in the call center everyone is suddenly tense. She bought a insurance program from us that for a low monthly payment if your internet stops working, even on the customer side of the demarc and inside the customers home we will dispatch a trouble ticket for an installer fix it for “no charge”. But there are steps to aquire such a magical ticket as abuse of this could cost a company significantly.


**begin scene 1**


&gt;**OP**: Hello, **ISP** tech support. How can I help you?


&gt;**already frustrated customer**: Yes hi. My internet is down. you need to send someone out to fix it.


&gt;**OP**: Okay. Well, before I can submit a ticket there are some steps we need to take first, are you getting any particular error? 


&gt;**Frustrated customer** huffs and I hear some clicking: yes there is! My computer says *could not join network* could you just send someone to fix it?


&gt;**op**: we sure can, but I need to check some things first.




This is where I was already looking at her extensive history on how she would yell at techs on call as soon as she starts to feel if she doesn’t get her way, so immediately I started to document everything. Her modem/router (that I will refer to as just router from her on out.) was online her ping times were great her signal strength from the DSL equipment on our end to her router looked very good as well  she was definitely getting the speeds she was paying for. But I wanted to cover all my bases. I use a tool on the router to have the router itself ping a domain or IP and display the results in the gui, and surprise surprise 0% packet loss to google.com,  and her router has been up since the last time she called.


&gt;**OP**: *unreasonably frustrated customer* do you think you could restart you router for me?


&gt;**frustrated customer** even bigger huff: well, I ALREADY did that. And I determined that it’s the lines. Check the lines!


&gt;**OP**: I need you to do it anyway and ill rest some equipment on my end.


Frustrated customer unplugs router and instantly plugs it back in 


&gt;**frustrated customer**: okay I did it


Total time elapsed of the router being off: .000001 seconds


&gt;dying inside **OP**: ma’am I will need you to leave It unplugged for longer than that, our equipment needs about 15 seconds before plugging it back in.
&gt;**frustrated customer**: fine!


**Frustrated Customer** complies and *router reboots and is still the MVP of this call*



&gt;**OP**: can you try connecting again for me?


Shockingly her internet doesn’t work still. I had a feeling from the start that there is something LAN side causing issues. Either her windows 10 PC or the 3rd party router (DLink) that I see in the ARP table. 


*when in doubt blame windows*



&gt;**frustrated customer**: it still doesn’t work, I’m telling you someone needs to come fix this NOW. I’m paying a lot of money for this!


&gt;**OP**: okay lets restart your DLink AP (probably a router, no way a customer has the concept of what double NAT could even bother them with usually)


&gt;**frustrated customer**: I will, but I KNOW it’s not the problem. I know it’s THE –bad word- LINES. And you’re wasting my time!!!



It’s at this point I get excited to embarrass her with how disgustingly nice my tone has been the whole time and she had been rude and profane (profanities omitted) because I was 75% sure that it was the DLink. She probably has an ancient wifi B/G/N AP that belongs in the dump. And if it wasn’t that definitely windows 10.



&gt;**frustrated customer**: okay I restarted it


&gt;**OP**: could you try connecting for me again?


&gt;**frustrated customer**: ….okay I think it’s working. BUT you still need to send someone out to CHECK THE LINES. I have *insurance plan*





&gt;**OP**:okay *schedules ticket* for x day at y time. *insurance plan* will help you if its related to the lines only if its anything else you will be responsible for time and labor charges




At this point I knew what the ticket would be and was feeling good, since for tickets that are needless and plain old harassment, as I disclosed to try to scare her out of it. But I knew most likely our installer would probably go out find nothing and waive the fee as a *courtesy check* at their discretion


Installer goes out, find no trouble. Close ticket.


**END SCENE 1**




&gt;**OP**: Hello IT

**BEGIN SCENE 2**

Less than 3 weeks have elapsed and I see her name pop on my screen with the usual trill of my desk phone. *sigh*


&gt;**frustrated customer**: PAGES ARE LOADING SLOWLY, there is SOMETHING wrong with YOUR LINES. Send someone out to fix them!


&gt;**OP** okay well let’s take a look at what’s going on


*enters the matrix of customer connection data* and unsurprisingly everything looks great. Better than the first time I looked at her connection. Her router has been up for 19 days (last time her and I were on the phone) and I want to do this quickly.


&gt;**OP** what trouble shooting steps have you done?


&gt;**frustrated customer**: everything that I need to know that. I need you to CHECK THE LINES!


&gt;**OP**: well I can’t “check the lines” without doing some troubleshooting, let’s start with your Dlink



DLink reboot ensues and customer is ever so unhappy. 



&gt;**OP**: are you able to connect? If you are able to that indicates something is wrong with you DLink or *the cable to it*.


&gt;**frustrated customer**: NO! The window went all gray and won’t respond when I click *incessant clicking*


&gt;**OP**: sounds like your computer is frozen or at least *internet browser*


&gt;**frustrated customer**: it’s not that. I telling you it’s the LINES



Rebooted her computer and that solved her issues and she chalked it up to “weird, I know it’s the lines” and once again demanded a ticket be placed again.



Installer goes out, find no trouble. Close ticket.


Unfortunately I was not graced with the privilege to speak with our beloved **frustrated customer** again but every few months I check up on her. She was so convinced it was the copper lines that we laid to her property she had this call 2 more times with two more call center techs.


Fast forward a couple months and she PAID BY THE FOOT for a special fiber drop to her house. Which can be $20-30 PER FOOT. And then USED THE SAME DLINK. More troubles followed for MONTHS no matter how many times we told her it has to be a LAN problem offered her solutions that were much cheaper and easier than is laying an undisclosed amount of money on a cable. Estimated between 8-15 grand! After she calls and harasses more coworkers she is finally convinced to at least replace the Ethernet cable to her DLink and poof! Like that! Callbacks stop happening.




TLDR: customer has as much money as stubbornness and spends many thousands just to have needed to replace a $7 Ethernet cord



Side note: she called and was angry again and told us it’s our fault when she had a power outlet go out and it shutoff her internet access and refused to believe it was her outlet (fiber ONTs have battery backup go into a phone only mode when they lose ac so subscriber can dial 911). This I would empathetic with her a bit if she hadn’t called multiple coworkers directly expletive’s and names over the matter.

t3_csg5zo,Support disable ordering online and only allowed telephone orders.,"I just posted a story about tech support and I honestly remembered a recent story that happened a month ago. 

I work in IT and I was requested to contact support of a software company. Yep even the big ones have crazy support. 

I ordered a product for one of my staff and then I discovered that the staff wants to use multiplecof their products. The all in one package seems like a better choice and was more cost effective. Also the staff only wanted products from this brand and didn't like alternatives. So I wanted to upgrade and remove the single product.


Here is where the funny business happens

Support: ""hello may I help you sir""

Me: "" yes I want to upgrade my package. I want the annual subscription that covers everything. ""

Support: "" that is not possible. Only way to do it is to delete account and recreate it again.""

Me"" are you sure this is the only option? There are no alternatives""

Support: "" nope is the only way""

Me: "" okay do it. Then after that I will order the upgrade""

Support: ""okay it is done""

I loggin the website and try to order but I cannot order online anymore. I was confused, before I was able to choose the software and can select multiple at once now the option is not available I called support.

Support: "" may I help you"" 

Me: "" yes I was able to order online, now I can't for some reason. Can you fix the issue""

Support: "" you do not have any software or history under your account""

I retell what happened

Support: "" okay sir you want the upgrade. Can you please give me your credit card details""

Me: "" no I want to order online please. Can you please check what is the issue with account""

Support: "" it is not possible to order online. Only way is through telephone""

I was confused cause I literally ordered online so I knew it was a lie. Maybe the staff is just reading a script or something. 

Me: "" I actually ordered online before. Can you please transfer me to someone who knows more about the account""

Support : "" okay will transfer call to manager""

Support manager : "" hello sir, I got informed that you are not willing to give us your credit card information on the phone""

Me confused as fuck and scared that this is a scam but I know I only contacts support through official website but maybe telephone support are contractors or something.

Support : ""only way to order our product is using telephone or using local vendor"".

Me: "" local vendor it is"". 


Called vendor and things went smooth. 


Though till this day I'm confused. Everyone I talked to agreed that what they asked for seems fishy.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cs8iym,The screen just cracked on its own,"This is my first ever post to reddit so forgive this  for not being a well written post.

Backstory: I work at an A.A.S.P. ( Apple Authorised Service Provider) which is basically is a company which is allowed by Apple to repair Apple products under the 1 year Apple manufacture warranty and AppleCare. My company also has our own warranty which is a cabon copy of AppleCare without any accidental damage cover called CompanyCare in this story. This means we follow all of Apples warranty guidelines for repairs to devices. 

We mainly sell Apple products with our warranty to business and schools. CompanyCare doesn't cover any accidental damage to the covered devices.

The repairs team that I am part of only communicates with our customers via a ticket system so I was able to re-read the ticket for this post.

Just so everyone is aware Apple and AASP's only replace iPads things like screen replacements or battery repalcements are can't be done, I have tried to look for Apple service guides to take iPads apart but they don't exist and the only reason given is because Apple says so.

I have shortened the length of the interaction with the customer this entire this took nearly 2 months.

Business IT Tech - BT

brackets are for my thoughts at the time as I remember them.

Square brackets are for contextual information.

Storytime:

So its the start of work and I'm checking the ticketing system for any tickets that came in after we closed yesterday. I see a new ticket from one of our client schools for an iPad (Somthing easy to start the day off with).

BT: Hey an iPad we bought less than 6 months ago has a cracked screen. The user had it in its case so this is not accidental damage, it must be defective. Image below.

The image showed a iPad with multiple cracks going across the whole screen. The cracks clearly originated from a section of the left had side of the screen where it was most likely dropped. (Well that's clearly accidental damage, does this guy think I'm stupid)

Me: Hi BT, from the image you sent me the iPad appears to have sustained accidental damage which is not covered by warranty. Please fill out the attached form so I can arrange collection of the device for replacement.\[ the form just asks for a pickup address, if the device has been backed up and a full description of the issue\]

A few hours later BT responds with the completed form. In the issue description section BT has written. ' screen cracked while device was being kept carefully in its case, device is defective not misused. ' This guy clearly wanted a free replacement but our company has a zero tolerance on free out of warranty repairs/replacements. Either the warranty covers the issue and the repair is free or the client has to pay for the repair or the repair doesn't happen. So my go to plan is to ignore his statement that the screen just cracked on its own and offer a quote for the repair.

Me: Since this will be a chargeable replacement would you like me to send you a quote for the replacement of the device. \[the replacement cost was around £200 while a new iPad of that model would cost £700\]

BT: Well, that's disputable. The user says that despite the iPad being in its case and being careful the screen cracked without an accidental incident. It is up to you and Apple to prove the device was not inherently defective in the initial 6 month per the Sale of Goods Act. This is not the time for the quotation as we believe the product failed without any accidental damage.

I rolled my eye's at this response but as I didn't want to get into an argument at the time so I arranged the collection of the device so that I could examine the device myself. I was hoping that they had damaged the screen previously and had a 3rd party company using 3rd party components to fix the issue so the warranty would be void\[ this is quite a common thing that happened\]. Also since I had only become fully qualified 3 months ago I wanted to cover all my bases before arguing with the client.

Me: BT, when the iPad arrives it will be thoroughly inspected using Apples latest service guides to confirm the eligibility of the device for warranty service.

BT: We will see about the Sale of Goods Act then depending on their findings. Have a great weekend. \[ he clearly didn't realise that I was a repair tech not some customer service guy\]

When the device arrived at the repair centre I performed a extremely detailed inspection of the iPad and made over a page of notes of the damage describing each of the cracks in detail and quoted the Apple visual inspection guidelines in relation to every aspect of the iPad condition \[ the display was not 3rd party\]. The damage was a bit more extensive the glass around the camera had broken off ant the camera was completely exposed. I spent about 3 hours documenting this but I wanted this to be dealt with as fast as possible and good notes would be the first step towards that, luckily we were having a slow week and my manager was happy for me to not have to deal with another attempt to get a free repair. With a S\*\*t eating grin I sent BT my findings.

Me: Hello BT, We have completed a thorough inspection of your 6th gen iPad inline with Apple's Visual Mechanical Inspection guidelines. This insection has revealed that the iPads display has sustained multiple cracks and chips to the glass which have exposed internal components of the device. This unfortunately makes the device ineligible for warranty service making the repair chargeable. Please see the attached quote.

Thinking that the guy would realise he was banging his head against a brick wall I felt quite satisfied and began working the new 2019 MacBook product qualifications. BT then kept coming back over the next few weeks asking questions about hoe the device was inspected and the and asking for specific definitions of the damage and eligibility criteria described in the service guide which we Apple doesn't allow us to disclose so I had to be intentionally vague about it which made him think I was trying to scam him. 

Eventually he responded with this.

BT: Apple will need to make the final call on weather this is a manufacturing defect. As this item is less than 6 months old Apple should be providing us with a report proving the device is not defective, so until evidence is provided it is not inherently defective I believe we are contractually entitled to s free replacement of the iPad.

This surprisingly pushed me over the edge and I didn't trust my self to respond to the arrogant son of a b\*\*ch. I completely disassembled the iMac I was using and then put it back together to calm myself, when my manager noticed what I was doing I said I was just practising on it.

Luckily we have a messaging system to get in contact with Apple's techs easily. I just sent them images of the iPad from several angles and requested a conformation of warranty eligibility. The Apple tech who I was in contact with told me to grow a spine and charge the customer for the replacement or send it back to them as I was wasting his time but he did confirm that the cracks were not a manufacturing fault. I agreed with him but our company policy is to get in contact with Apple when the customer requests it. I told myself  this would be my last attempt to get payment for the replacement device.

Me: Apple has reviewed the damage to the device and confirmed that the cracks in the display are not caused by any manufacturing process or materials used in construction of the device. Apple has confirmed that we can proceed with this as a out of warranty replacement. Please send over a purchase order for the replacement of the iPad or we will return the device to you as a unwanted out of warranty replacement. 

BT reponded quickly since if we put this down as a unwanted repair it would be passed on to the schools procurement team who would have questions.

BT: Sorry for all the back and forth but I need that paper trail to satisfy my manager. Purchase order to follow ASAP.

After that the PO came through and the iPad was replaced without further incident.

Later I found out that the school was known to haggle over any and all chargeable repairs, so at least I was not the only repair tech to suffer under them.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_csf1tk,Unofficial USPS IT guy - 4 repost,"The beginning. 

The first office my friend was working in was going to get a computer. The postmaster was an older man. People saw him as a father figure, friend, fun loving nice guy. He was so computer illiterate, it wasn’t funny. This of course caused funny situations.

It was set up for him and was shown how to send and receive emails. At the time, that’s all it was used for. The postmaster would check for emails 3 times a day. The computer used a dial up modem. This caused issues for updates.

One day the postmaster received a phone call about updating the computer, he asked my friend about it. My friend told him to set it up Saturday night and let it go all weekend or forget it. The postmaster smile. Ok, I’ll forget it. 

There were several simple problems the postmaster asked my friend about. How to save, cut and paste, what happens if I dump a 40 oz soda in the back of this thing?  Things like that. 

Edit: when I said I would show him how to cut and paste, he took out a large pair of scissors. I told him those weren’t needed. He said darn, he really wanted to cut something off the computer 

My friend asked why he hated computers the way he did.  

The postmaster said, whenever he pushes the buttons, bad things happen. 

How bad?

The postmaster smiled and told this story. His friend wanted to email him, keep in contact. His friend wrote down instructions, step by step, how to use email. Even gave him a computer. The postmaster followed the instructions and a strange screen came up. He turned off the computer and didn’t touch it again. 

A couple weeks later, his friend asked why he hadn’t email him.  The postmaster explained what happened and the strange screen that appeared. His friend looked at him in disbelief, your not supposed to be able to get into that. It sounds like the main programming for the internet. Did you do anything on that page?  The postmaster smile, yeah, I didn’t like the way this side looked so I made a couple changes.  His friend yelled No!  You’re not supposed to . . . The postmaster stopped him and said he turned it off. I told you computers were bad for me. 

My friend smiled, it was also that postmaster that told others about my friend. And word travels fast. Before retiring, that postmaster said he would have stayed long if it wasn’t for that monstrosity on his desk. (Pointing at the computer)",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cs0a28,"That's not my job, that's morning shift's job","So I worked in tech support for 6 months. I have fortunately quit that job. We provided tech support for a software that is used in call centers and tech support. This happened during an evening shift of mine, around 6-7 pm (it was 24x7 support).


So this client had an issue. We provided a short term solution, but it needed to be fixed with a patch update for a proper fix. Depending on the issue, we provide various patch updates. So in this case 4-5 patches needed to be updated. The size for them was around 1-2 GB. The patch update required atleast 1 hour downtime. But we asked clients for 2 as a buffer in case anything went wrong.


So what we did was, we uploaded  the patches on WeTransfer, where you upload files, it provides you with a link. Anyone can down the files by clicking on the link. The thing is, the link is valid for only 7 days.


So I am talking with this customer.

Me - C, so I am providing you with this link. You need to download the files through this link, and just copy them onto your server. Then we will update the patches on x date.


C: The update will be performed in morning time not evening time. So, that's not my job, that's the morning shift's job.

Me: (ugh) Fine, sir can you please tell your morning shift, to download and copy the files, otherwise we will not be able to do it.

C: I will do it.

The update was scheduled on x date. I provided the customer with the link 8-10 days before that.

Update day:

Person who will perform the activity (A): Sir where are the patch files?

Different person on client side (Cx): what files? We weren't provided with any files.

A: Sir, the link is on the ticket.

Cx: but I wasn't informed of it.

*A calls me over and asks me about this. I tell him I had informed C about this*

A: Sir, your coworker C was informed about it.

Cx: but why didn't you inform me, as I would be your PoC today.

A: we were also never informed who would be the PoC. Anyway let's download the files.

*A tries to download the file but the link has expired because 7 days have passed.*

A and Cx get into an argument again.


After a pretty useless argument, A downloads the patch files on his computer from our repository, then upload it to wetransfer, provide Cx with the link. Cx then downloads it on his system and then copy them on to the server.


A then finally updates all the patches on the system.


Overall the time taken was around 2-2.5 hours with 1-1.5 hours of downtime. Cx was fucking mad because we took so long and didn't provide the link beforehand (yes he said that). As if that wasn't enough, he then proceeded to write a feedback on the ticket itself about the same things. We had to explain everything to our department head.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_crv46k,The LED is blinking but it seems fine otherwise,"First time poster, blah blah blah.

I work for an Internet/TV provider and manage, among other things, the TV backend and client software. Received a ticket from the inventory people saying that the set top boxes being tested (returned from customer, tested before being refurbished) have their front LEDs blinking non-stop, but otherwise seem okay, asking what to do. Confused, I make the trip to see it myself. Normally a continuous flashing LED means it's still booting so that doesn't make sense to me.

On arrival I see that the description is correct, but I misunderstood the meaning of blinking. The blinking was rapid, indicating that it's receiving continuous remote control signals. All our remote are IR-based (not radio) which should make finding the source straight-forward. I walk up to the bench confirm my hypothesis: putting my hand in front of the box stops the signal and removing it resumes the signal. So now I slowly use my whole body to try blocking the signal while also pulling up the camera app on my phone in case I need it.

Upon the flashing LEDs returning to solid (to the surprise of those working on the floor), I rotate 180 degrees and look at what's right in front of me... A large transparent plastic container full of remotes haphazardly placed within it sitting on a shelf. I don't even need my phone to find the exact culprit remote - it's the one on the bottom. The ticket creator is following me and, upon seeing the glowing buttons on the remote control, understands what is happening.

Ticket closed. Cleaning up the remotes is their problem.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_crwax4,A wrong number and a very happy customer,"Yet another riveting (?) tale from my days as hospital IT.


This particular Friday was glacially slow, so I was almost relieved when the phone rang.  

&gt;Me: IT, This is Bacon

&gt;Caller: This is Angry Nurse. I’m calling because Edwin from IT promised me an update on my computer. He hasn’t called back and I’m unable to do my job until it’s fixed. Can you come to my office and fix it?

&gt;Me: Ma’m, we don’t have an Edwin that works here. Are you sure -

&gt;C: That’s not true, I spoke to him on Wednesday and he said he was going to fix it 

&gt;Me: We didn’t….  M’am, where are you calling from?

&gt;C: Red tower, 7West, of course.

*The elevator panels went to 8 (thanks, eBay spares) but we only had 4 floors. For a second, I thought she'd lost her mind. Then, I realized we had no red tower*

&gt;Me: Uh, what hospital are you calling from?

&gt;C: *Affiliate Hospital several hundred miles away*

&gt;Me: Oh, you’ve called $Hospital IT. I’m a LONG way from you

&gt;C: Oh...I’m sorry, didn’t mean to be rude, but my computer hasn’t worked right in weeks. Edwin keeps promising to fix it but nothing has helped so far. You’re probably the wrong person to help me. I feel bad for having bothered you.

This poor lady sounds totally defeated. I feel even worse for her because I'm going to have to ruin her day. I'll have tell her I can't help her. See, we were contractually PROHIBITED from providing IT support to all Affiliate Hospitals because reasons.

*EDIT: Let me pause to explain the quirks of my predicament. You see, our hospital had recently been bought out by $LargeHospitalChain and integrated into their network, but we were still using our own phone system. That meant I could easily remote to her PC, but unlike the folks at $CorporateHelpdesk, none of my calls were recorded. CorporateHQ was fanatical about policies and procedures, but at $Hospital, we’d been flying by the seat of our pants for years...*


I took a quick glance around. No one is in earshot. YOLO time.

&gt;Me: No worries. What seems to be the issue? I’ll try to help as much as I can.

&gt;C: I’m not sure you can fix it. They’ve already replaced my PC twice and said they might have to rebuild the server

&gt;Me: Server? What aren’t you able to do? What’s not working?

&gt;C: The incident reporting system. I can’t use it at all.



*For context, most hospitals have some kind of incident management software. They use it to document customer complaints, slip and falls, medication errors…it’s basically ticketing software for medical oopsies. They take it very seriously and run a lot of reports out of it.*


I’m chuckling inside. At first, I doubted if I could help her at all, but I was trained as the local guru on it. I’ve spent so much time with the incident reporting system that I almost know more about it than the admins at Corporate IT. I gotchu fam.

&gt;Me: OK, I know a fair bit about that. What error is it giving?

&gt;C: I’m not sure what it says, but they said it was unfixable

&gt;Me: Well, I’d like to take a look. It’s not like I could make it worse LOL. What’s your PC name?

&gt;C: PC12345 but I’m not sure what you could do to help

I remoted to her PC and had her show me what it was doing. Same dumb .NET error I fought every day, plus an INI file error from being uninstalled wrong in the past. Ten second fix, hopefully. Today I get to be someone’s hero.

So, I ran my .NET script, deleted the INI, and had her try it again. My hero status is in jeopardy...it’s still not working. Time for the hop-on-one-foot-and-bark dance that this hot garbage requires. Reset IE, disk cleanup, clear cookies, reboot PC, re-run the scripts that Corporate IT doesn’t know I have. If this doesn't fix it, I got nothing.

Ritual dance complete, we try it again.

&gt;C: Oh my god, it works! I don’t know what you did but you have no idea how grateful I am. I’ve not been able to do incident audits for a couple of weeks and my boss has really been p!ssed. Thank you so much!
 
&gt;Me: No worries, glad I could be of assistance! I hope you enjoy your weekend. Bye!

t3_crzbi2,Unofficial USPS IT guy 5,"This could also fall under idontworkhere or notmyjob. My friend was asked to help set up a new computer in a post office. He was sitting at a desk about 6 feet behind the counter. After unboxing the computer. He was hooking cords when he heard someone clear her throat. Looking up, a woman was looking at him. The postmaster was busy helping someone else but intervened. He here for the computer, I can help you in a second. 

She turned, I need this sent out. 

Like I said, I’ll help you in a second. I just have to help him first (motioning to the man in front of her)

The man walked out, the woman sent out her package and the postmaster apologized. Told him he just needs to set it up, update, and he’s done. 

The setup was easy, the update would take time. And he sat in a chair waiting. After a little while, the postmaster said she needed to grab the mail from the blue box outside the door. There hadn’t been anyone in a where so she figured it would be a good time. 

There were 2 way to enter the building. It seemed as the postmaster walked out 1 door. A woman walked in the other. She walked up to the counter. Impatiently cleared her throat and glared at my friend. 

Sorry, she’ll be right in to help you. 

I saw her outside. Why don’t you help me? (So much attitude)

I can’t. I’m just here to hook up the computer.

You work here. You’re wearing a post office ID.( hanging from his shirt)

That’s to prove I’m allowed to be back here. I don’t have access to those computers, to sell you things. (Pointing to the computers at the counter)

Well, I need stamps

Do you have the login code for those computers?(he has no idea if he needed login code or not)

No

Well neither do I. So you are going to have to wait.  Seconds later the postmaster walked up to help her.

t3_crfoqm,User expects her convoluted Rube Goldberg pathological workflow built on ancient hardware to work indefinitely.," 

I know I should not blame this person for the situation she's in.  And I should blame Tier 2 for this even getting to us.

I  support enterprise ""Unified Messaging""/phone/IM/conferencing software  products, for the publisher of the products, delivering service to its  internal staff.

The problem  statement:  User loses audio when she joins $product meeting.  This  sounds like a fairly simple problem, that rarely would make it to Tier  3.  Inside ticket history, I find the prior problem statement:  ""Phone  Audio"" feature does not prompt to enter phone number in the meeting.   That one is completely useless, except insofar as it tells me that the  current problem statement is out of whack by several orders of  magnitude.

T2 says she is running  the product in a virtual machine -- but they don't say whether it's a VM  locally running on her PC (supported) or a VM running on another PC but  in the same building she's in (best effort only), or if she's using VPN  to remote into a VM running on a server that has its own hardware  abstraction layer. (Supported?  What you been smokin'?)

They  don't say why she's running a VM.  They asked her a lot of questions  that were too complicated for an ordinary user to understand, and it's  clear T2 didn't understand the questions either or they'd have realized  her answers made no sense.

She's  not ""available"" in IM so I keep reading.  Audio works when she's the  first person to join a meeting.  IF she's not the first to join, audio  does not work.  However, in the latter case, if she's the only one  remaining after all others have quit, audio starts working again.

My  head is spinning at this point.   The VM is abstracted from the  hardware of the server.  If she's dialing in remotely, RDP has its own  abstraction layer.  And what's this about using her cellphone as a  speakerphone?

I get in contact  with the user and start asking questions.  Gradually I tease out what's  really going on.  She's not using a VM.  She's remoting via RDP to a  desktop in her office that runs the product client.  When she joins the  meeting, she uses a feature that routes the audio through her cellphone.   it's not that ""audio doesnt work"", it's that when she's not the first  to join, the option to call out never appears.  She can't do her  presentation because she has no audio.

Why  can't she run the product's Android client?  Her cellphone is a Samsung  S3 running KitKat 4.4.  The security software we use will barely run,  let alone client software.

Why  can't she run the product client on her remote laptop?  It's a 2010  workstation-class laptop (Nvidia Quattro) with Windows 7 on it.  When  she runs the client, her laptop crashes and (she says) has to be  reimaged.  Every time she's tried.

The  PC she's connecting to is running Windows 10 at least.  It's a 2014-era  Dell Precision running Windows 10 -- but the on-board audio doesn't  work.

Which is why she has been  using the conferencing system to route audio to her cellphone.  She can  present her powerpoint slides and use her Android 4.4 phone as a  speakerphone.

I ask her ""Have you  tried just dialing in to the conference call with your phone, and  presenting with the remote workstation?""  Her answer:  I'm not sure what  you mean.  ""I mean, dial the conferencing center's telephone number and  enter in the conference ID"".  Her:  I told you I can't run the  telephony client on the phone.

Me: Trying to figure out how to pronounce ""0.o""

Me:  Your phone has a dial pad, right?

Her: Yes.

Me: . . .

Her: . . .

Me: . . .

Her: You mean I could call the conferencing center using my phone?  Will that work?

Me: Fighting the urge to say something snarky. &lt;ahem&gt; "" Y e s ""

Her: . . .   Oh! Oh wait! I get it!  That's BRILLIANT! Thank you SO MUCH.

Me:  So aside from that, what you should do is print out this chat log and  take it to your manager.  I'm pretty solid sure that this conversation  is your business case for getting a new laptop.

This  company generally keeps its staff updated with recent hardware, and has  a two-year refresh cycle.  I'm a contractor, and I've got a Precision  3520 -- not state of the art, but it's got a USB C Thunderbolt port, 16  gigs and an I7.  I do in fact play games on it when I'm WFH or alone in  the office.

I know exactly how  this person got to be where she's at:  FNG gets the scrounged gear.  Manager holds back on spending anything until s/he notices that the FNG  isn't complaining about her crappy 5, 6 and 9 year old equipment.   Ingenious-if-a-bit-thick user figures out how to get her job done with  these ancient relics.  Eventually she forgets that it was an abomination  of a workflow and now can't remember what it was like to have the right  tool for the job.

I'm not sure what you mean.

Me again. I usually post my most surreal story on Fridays.

Backstory: I am one of only two IT personnel at a dozen+ building facility with over 1,000 endpoints. Naturally, they smash every IT position into one role. This leads into some.. interesting interactions.

Most surreal of this week (it was hard just picking one):

This will be a quick one.

User catches me in the hall, saying ""you have to look at my computer, my boss said she sent me an important email but I never got it. Ever since you guys did network changes it's been doing this"".

This is the same person that, 6 months ago, told me with a straight face, ""I don't believe in e-mails. If something important happens, I'll know.""

Go to user's area. She stands up and motions me to have a seat at her computer. She's logged in with her profile and everything.

First thing I see is an Internet Explorer window with a search that says ""help how do I open email"". This woman has been in her position two decades.

I go through [virtualization solution] to access her email, making sure she takes notes. Of course her email is at quota and full. Judging by email content, she hasn't logged in since about 2015.

I then proceed to take around 45 minutes to help her clean out her email inbox, have her boss re-send the ""important email"" (because it bounced).",talesfromtechsupport

ADDITIONAL TRIGGER WARNING : This is a long post.  That's partly because I feel it's the best way to convey the essential nuance of the story, but also because I had to go through this sh*t in real time, and you lot don't deserve much better.


Introducing characters as they appear seemed to work OK last time, so I'll do it that way again.  Buckle up.

Many years back I worked for XYZ Inc.  They made specialist (and expensive) production machines for a particular type of industry.  This story takes place a few years after the start of my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/cq42fp/no_my_private_number_isnt_the_24hour_helpline_for/), and XYZ Inc.'s biggest job in hand was fitting out a new manufacturing plant for a particular customer, we'll call them ABC Corp.  To give a flavour of the scope here, just phase1 of this factory took eighteen months of work after the order was placed and XYZ Inc.'s direct billing ran well into 8 figures, and we also specified for ABC Corp. to buy a similar value of other manufacturer's machinery so that it could work directly with ours.  There was over a half a million in conveyor belts alone.

You might think that meant we were in charge of the whole thing, but we weren't.  ABC Corp. wanted to keep control and 'economise' by using their own people where possible, so they ran it themselves, and as well as being the customer they acted as project managers and liason between the architects, builders, machinery and plant suppliers, fitting trades, etc.etc.  Not a problem as far as we at XYZ Inc. were concerned.  We sold the job to a specification, we wrote the contract to define that specification, and we will have no problem delivering on all the promises made therein.  EXACTLY as promised.

Oh, but if you want to change that specification after the fact, there'll be a bill for doing it.  As far as we're concerned, 'feature creep' means Uncle Fester.  And if we're working away and then unexpectly find that whatever it is of yours we need to connect to, incorporate or work around isn't ready on schedule, isn't to spec, or is some new and exciting spec we didn't agree to, progress will stop and you'll get an even bigger bill.  And the definition of 'yours' is anything we don't supply, because you're managing this sh*tshow, not us.

Did i mention the project manager?  ABC Corp.'s pick for this role was the talent they'd already recruited to be plant manager at the new factory when the place started running.  Makes sense, you'd think - who else could possibly be more motivated to make their own life easier by delivering the best built, most efficient new factory imaginable?  And having done that, who would then also be an in-house expert on every part of the facility able to trouble shoot production issues as soon as they came up?  Well, I don't know what guidance ABC Corp. had given the recruitment agent into the kind of person they wanted, but it must have made fascinating reading.  In the collective opinion of XYZ Inc.'s people on the ground, the individual selected for this prestigious role had precisely two skills ;
1)  Shouting; and,
2)  Lying.
And frankly they weren't much good at the second one.

But I digress.

Part of this job was a factory data collection and analysis system.  All the machines in the building had at least some level of on-board intelligence, and every single one was going to have an ethernet connection to a data collection server.  That server would monitor what happened throughout the factory second-by-second and then produce a range of standard and custom reports.  Not a cheap option to add on a factory of this size, but numbers never lie.  So if you've got good people looking at those numbers, an system like this that never misses the detail can be an amazing tool to keep that place running efficiently, and spot future issues while they're still small.  F*ck knows what ABC Corp. thought ProjectManager was going to do with it.

Part of the deal with this thing was that XYZ Inc. also got to see the data.  That way we can learn from it and incorporates those lessons in our next generation of machines to make them better.  And if ABC Corp. felt they had some complaint about our product, the data system was there to tell the whole unvarnished story as to whether they were right or wrong.  To do this, the XYZ Inc. supplied data server rack that the ethernet lines all connected to also needed an ISDN line.  (If you've not heard of ISDN before, no worries, it's basically a dedicated phone line optimised for data - there's plenty more Nerdspeak in the detail obviously, but that's all we need for story purposes.)

You'll remember XYZ Inc. weren't in charge of the entire project, and the ISDN line counted as being part of the building, so it's something that ABC Corp. had to arrange themselves.  And like everything else, it has a specification, a location (in the phase1 server room where we been told to install the data server rack), and a due date.

Sorry, I gotta go back and whine about ABC Corp.'s personel again.  I've already told you about their new plant management hire.  Obviously, in that case, ABC Corp. was seeking someone really special to bring the new factory on line with a bang (I know they succeeded, I heard the thud from here), and they had the budget to match.  Unfortunately they hadn't been able to be quite so picky in the hiring management at their existing local plant.  Oh, and the place was also a hotbed of nepotism.  'Working from home without leave' was also rife.

So some of the existing employees, in particular those who seemed destined to spend the rest of eternity in lower or middle management, were just awe inspiring in their apparent in ability to do any work more challenging than holding down the floor.  IT was 'run' by one such an individual, who also had a truly jaw-dropping lack of self-awareness.  Department second in command was pretty much a carbon copy, as was the one other tech I personally dealt with.  If there was any qualification test at all to work there, I can only assume its main feature was the ability to recognise a PC without being prompted.  Extra points and earmarked for fast-track promotion if you knew that a laptop is 'better'.

Of course it's unfair to characterise the capabilities of an entire department - there were about six or seven ITfolks in total - based on just the head honcho, deputy and chief tech.  I only visited the actual IT office a couple of times, and I'm not sure they were all sentient at the time, so maybe just to draw a veil over it and hope for the best.

Anyway, ABC Corp's occasionally present local IT manager, hencefore known as F\*ckwittAboutTown, as well as being somebody's offspring, was put in charge of all IT infrastructure etc. at the new factory.  And if all goes well they're lined up for the cushy job of heading the IT department at the shiny new place.  On the subject of 'things going well', so many things have already been totally f\*cked up that AboutTown has by now been given specific written instructions to do/check EVERY single thing personally.

So arranging the ISDN line is their job.  One of my many many jobs is to chase them up on it.  Repeatedly.

We're about a year into the project by this stage, so I know what I'm facing.  I've simply scheduled myself to call F\*ckwittAboutTown every Tuesday and Thursday to check the current status of each individual item on the ever-growing laundry list of IT failure.  Take notes for the project documentation and my colleagues, and pass details of anything new that is wrong/overdue (Or, even more spectacularly wrong and overdue than last time) onto those responsible for billing ABC Corp.

About two weeks after the due date for the ISDN line I'm told it's done, and I can tick it off my list.  I will admit to being quite surprised.  About a week later I even get a phone number for it.

I pass this startling but welcome news onto the XYZ Inc. subsidiary building the data server rack.  (I'll call them XYZData from now on)  And those doubting Thomases ask me to check if it's really true!  They even want me to plug something in at the ABC Corp. end so they can test the data capabilities of their new toy.  How could anyone be so untrusting?

As it happens, I wasn't planning to be on site for a couple of weeks (I still had other work apart from this project), so I call in a favour and ask one of the XYZ Inc. techs commissioning some of our other gear to take a few minutes and go up to the phase1 server room and do the necessary for our offsite guys at XYZData.  I pass on the nice clear directions I've been given - the ISDN socket is on the waist-height trunking in the server room, right where the XYZ Inc. rack is supposed to go, and is labelled with both its function and the phone number - and leave the tech to organise with the XYZData what time/day best suits them both.

A couple of days later I get a call from our tech to tell me that the test was a bust.  They couldn't find the ISDN socket in the advertised location.  Or anywhere else.  It's not even a big room, and as yet had basically no equipment in it.

I thank our tech for their wasted lunch break and call F\*ckwittAboutTown.  I explain the apparent absence of the ISDN line and the time we've lost by our inability to check its functionality with surpassing patience.  F\*ckwittAboutTown assures me that the line is in, tested, and they have done this personally.  I express minor reservations as to the strict accuracy of these assertions.  After some discussion I persuade the esteemed head of ABC Corp.'s IT department to meet with our tech at the server room.  So they can personally show an XYZ Inc. staff member where the blasted thing is.

A week goes by, and the F*ckwittAboutTown has mysteriously blown off two meetings with the XYZ Inc. tech.  A couple of days later I ring ABC Corp. IT Department.

""Hi F*ckwittAboutTown, just a courtesy call to remind you that you were due to meet with our commissioning tech in the new factory server room five minutes ago.""

'Yeah, they cancelled on me, some urgent problem with one of your machines.'

""Really?  They're standing in the server room waiting for you now.""

'You sure?'

""I'm standing next to them.  We'll see you in ten minutes.""

About fifteen minutes later (there was a cross town drive involved) F\*ckwittAboutTown arrives to join XYZ Inc. Tech and I.  A brief discussion and some pointing at walls ensues, but the ISDN connection remains frustratingly absent.  Then, and only then, F\*ckwittAboutTown plays their get-out-of-jail-free card.

They have an invoice.  An invoice from a phone company no less.  And on this invoice are charges for the installation of an ISDN line at the new factory.   Billed to ABC Corp. and signed for by F\*ckwittAboutTown.  There is the minor detail that the order was placed after they was told me the thing was already done and tested, but fair's fair, a solid two out of ten for effort.

The XYZ Inc. Tech and I exchange a silent glance and agree that the receipt is likely genuine, forging such a thing not being in AboutTown's known skillset.  Motive and opportunity are definitely there, but means is lacking, and probably always will be.

AboutTown then reasonably explains that having paid the invoice they didn't bother to check the work in any way, and just said that they had, because it was obviously all going to be fine.  The tension leaves their body and they bask in the satisfaction of job well done.

It's now my turn to explain a few things, not least of which is that, despite F*ckwittAboutTown having ordered the thing on ABC Corp.'s account, there isn't any trace of it whatsoever.  AboutTown has literally nothing to show for having spent their employer's money.  The server rack will still therefore need a connection to what I'm now refering to as the 'real world', that place on the other side of the factory fence, ideally using a telecoms line of the contractually specified type.  It was at about this point that the XYZ Inc. commissioning tech decided they needed to go outside for some fresh air.

About a week of non-progress later, I am summoned to ProjectManager's office to explain the bill that had resulted from these shenanigans, and the upshot of that conversation was that as far as the ISDN line was concerned, I was to ""fix it"" so that XYZData were happy and ABC Corp. weren't in breach of contract.  F*ckwittAboutTown was relieved of this particular responsibility, and I was given authority to do the job with ABC Corp.'s money.  Lucky me.

Well I had an invoice for work allegedly done.  I had a phone number.  And if you tried connecting to that number using suitable hardware it seemed as though it was a real line but with no hardwire on the other end.

So I rang the phone company's tech support, explaining the situation and my new-found authority.  An appointment was duly arranged for a PhoneCompany technician to come on-site and investigate.  A couple of days later, I got a phone call from the technician who'd been allocated the job.  Personal service, I like that.  They were cancelling the appointment and it was a courtesy call to let me know.

""Why?"", I asked.

'So you don't waste time waiting for me when I'm not coming.'

""No, why are you cancelling the appointment?""

PhoneCompanyTech then explained that they'd prepared for the visit in advance by testing the line (all OK) and looking up its specs.  And from the exchange boxes it was listed as being routed from, they could tell there was no way it could be connected to the building they were meeting me in.  Not even the same part of town.  So I explained that I was holding paperwork which indicated quite clearly that ABC Corp. had paid for the connection to be in that very building, and that they even had a receipt saying it now was.

PhoneCompanyTech generously agreed that this was something of an issue, so instead of just closing the ticket, they referred it inwards and upwards to some higher level PhoneCompany tech department, and gave me the relevant numbers and contact details.

It took a couple more days to get the whole story.  Apparently, the phone tech assigned the installation job had been unable to find the new factory site for some reason.  I don't know why, they had the address, other phone lines had been installed on the same site by the same company, multiple delivery trucks from half a dozen vendors had come directly to site without difficulty after journeys of up to a thousand miles.  I mean it was the biggest construction site in town, the main building was the size of a football pitch.  I dunno, maybe they just weren't from this planet.

Anyway, having failed to find the job site, they did what any reasonable person would do in the circumstances.  Chose a random phone exchange box somewhere in the local area and ran an ISDN line from that into a convenient nearby building.  Tick off the job as complete and move on to the next one.  Actually I'm pretty d*mn sure they weren't from this planet.  PhoneCompany's super-techs were at least as dumb-founded by this as I was.

Let me say that again just in case it didn't sink in.  PhoneCompany took ABC Corp.'s order for an additional telecoms facility, and their money, and in response, PhoneCompany's staff member broke into someone else's building in a different part of town and installed a phone line without the owner's consent.

I have, to this a day, a mental picture of a British copper collaring a criminal with the immortal line ""I'm arresting you on suspicion of installing a phone line without consent, you do not have to say anything, but anything you do say may be taken down and used in evidence against you.  If you'll just step this way...""  It just won't go away, it's still there when I shut my eyes.

So we discussed ABC Corp.'s options.  What I wanted was the line disconnected from wherever it was, and reconnected in the server room at ABC Corp.'s new factory.  Don't care if it's the same number or gets a new one.  Sadly that wasn't an option.  At least disconnection wasn't.  That needed additional permissions.

""But ABC Corp. are paying for the line, and they've given me authority on this?  I can fax that through again.""

'Yeah, we accept that, but it's not in their building, and we need the building owner's consent to remove a data line.'

""Which building is it?  Where?  The line isn't supposed to be there anyway, surely we can just tell them.""

'Oh we can't tell you where the connection is if it's not on ABC Corp.'s site.  That'd be a breach of customer confidentiality.'

""Do they know they have an ISDN line?""

'Probably not.'

""So tell them about it and ask for permission to remove it.""

'Oh no, we can't do that, it's against PhoneCompany policy to recommend that a customer disconnects a billable service.'

""But the service is unused, and the bills for it go to ABC Corp.  Who are prepared to pay for an ISDN line going to the right place that they can actually use.""

'Rules are rules.  We aren't allowed to do that and we can't tell you where the line is connected either.'

In the end, I bowed to the inevitable and ordered a new ISDN line for the new factory using ABC Corp.'s money.  I also recommended that they stop paying bills on the original one and demand a refund on the installation, but I've no idea if anyone ever took notice of that.  Did this particular debacle affect F*ckwittAboutTown's chances of getting the cushy new job?  Probably not, they were likely still seen as the best of the available internal candidates, and all they'd ever done here was claim to have personally tested something that didn't actually exist.  Barely worth mentioning in the wacky world of ABC Corp. 

The End.

You thought I'd forgotten that special appearance by the server rack didn't you.

A couple of weeks later the data server rack arrived from XYZData.  The new factory was laid out like a lot of big modern plants - production machines in great caverous halls with plenty of room to swing a forklift, a three storey office block tucked away on one side for the ancilliary departments, and production offices and the like spread around the machinery halls, as near possible to what they controlled.  So the server room was on a mezzanine floor attached to the wall between material processing and phase1 production.

At this point I need to introduce SiteManager.  Because of the way this place was being built in phases, with facilities and machinery being installed as soon as their part of the building was done, ABC Corp. had had to contract an OHS specialist to control the site for them.  SiteManager had no interest in whether the factory worked to spec. or even ever produced anything at all.  Their job was to make sure that the commissioning techs weren't run over by a forklift driver who'd just be blinded by someone welding steelwork.  Or similar. And when phase1 started operations, to make sure that those were kept separate from contruction, installation and commissioning of phases 2 and 3.

If you wanted to do something, anything, on site, you needed SiteManager's say-so.  If whatever it was was your speciality or had been done before, then it was simply a question making sure you had clear space to work in (kind of like air traffic keeping planes apart in the sky).  If you want to do something new, SiteManager will be checking your plan versus OHS rules to make sure they're happy.  SiteManager's word on this is FINAL.  SiteManager was great to deal with and knew their stuff.  And they were insured up to the hilt.

So I drop a line to SiteManager saying this thing has arrived, where to find it, and could they have a forklift put it up on the mezzanine please.  No hurry, any time this week will be fine.  Thanks.

A couple of days later I get an email back saying the server rack is now on the right floor, but SiteManager can see a potential problem.  They'll be happy to show me the cause of their concern next time I'm on site.

So I thank them again and arrange to meet.  Standing next to server rack on the mezzanine landing outside the server room, the problem is obvious.  The rack won't go through the server room door, it's too tall.  The rack is a standard 19inch job.  They do come in various heights, but this one is what we'd been expecting, just under two metres, six foot and a couple of inches (I don't remember the exact number).  Close inspection of the door, on the other hand, shows that it's quite a bit shorter than normal.  Most people can walk through it without stooping, but not all.  There's no apparent reason for this, the ceiling on both sides of the wall is a good twelve feet (say four metres) up.  It smells distinctly like a ProjectManager special.

So I give XYZData a call.  Once I've persuaded them that it isn't April Fools, they agree that it'll be OK to tip the server rack over on its back, roll it through the door on a trolley, and stand it up again.  Just check all the screws and connections look solid before doing it.

Unfortunately SiteManager doesn't like this.  We can maybe use the forklift to put the thing back down at ground level, lie it down there and then lift it back up to the mezzanine again, but once it's through the doorway there's no way the forklift, or any other mechanical handling gear can reach in there to stand it up again.  And it weighs too much for SiteManager to allow one or even two people to do it by hand.

Either the doorway has to change, the server be put somewhere else (NOT happening), or we're going to have to put some mechanical handling gear up on the mezzanine to do the job.  And that equipment not only has to be able to be lifted up there by the forklift, it also has to be able to fit through the problem doorway.  There isn't anything suitable currently in use on site, so it'll need to be hired in specially.  And when the equipment hire company were told that the first thing we planned going to do with their kit was load it on a forklift and put it on a mezzanine that presently lacked guard rails, they immediately added extra insurance.  Combined total is just into four figures.  To move a server rack through a doorway into the room it was designed for.

Time to present ProjectManager with the options.  Rebuilding the doorway so that standard issue server racks and moderately tall people can get in and out of the server room without being scalped strikes both SiteManager and I as best, but it's not our decision.

Now, before you ask, it had been suggested that the pre-wired and fully tested rack could be disassembled, carried through the doorway in pieces and put back together again.  But the XYZData weren't very pro anyone, even from another subsidiary, messing with the hardware they'd supplied.  And our commissioning techs on site weren't exactly short of their own work to do either.  Also, ABC Corp. didn't want to pay the bill for the extra labour to actually do this.

Then ProjectManager announced that ABC Corp.'s IT department would do the disassembly/reassembly, at only modest cost to XYZ Inc.  I think it was while I was declining this kind offer that the XYZ Inc. Tech (the same one who'd previously looked for the ISDN line with me) experienced straight face retention issues and had to leave the building for further supplies of fresh air.

Cue a rant from ProjectManager about how ridiculous it was that they were constantly being forced to change their project decisions by XYZ Inc.  And when we weren't doing that we handing out bills for stuff of theirs we were changing for them.  Didn't us peasants understand that ProjectManager was in charge?

With hindsight I think I'll now have to admit that it is just possible that ""Why not try getting something right for a f*cking change,"" was maybe not the most helpful thing to say at this point.

Whatever.  It was duly decreed from on high (ProjectManager) that the doorway would not change, temporarily or otherwise, and the server rack would just have to get in the room somehow.

Well the contract says the data server should be in the nice air-conditioned server room.  So does common sense.  And if the door can't be made to fit, we'll have to go with SiteManager's plan.  I give them a heads up.  

""No problem,"" says SiteManager, and agrees to make preliminary arrangements.  Obviously to confirm the booking(s) they'll need to know who's picking up the tab for this.  Will it be XYZ Inc.?   No.

We wrote the contract remember.  And the data-collection system has its own section in there.  By a curious coincidence, in addition to saying what it does, and the connections and power feeds it needs, that section just happens to define the size and weight of the equipment XYZData would be supplying, and the minimum height and width of the path required to get it from the loading dock to the server room.  Path to be kept clear for the lifetime of the factory, just in case XYZ Inc. need to swap the rack for another one sometime down the line.  We liked writing stuff down.  We were good at that sh*t.

*""What do you want?'""*

""Just a bit of paperwork, ProjectManager.  This is a change note for ABC Corp. to confirm the alteration to contract spec with the smaller server room door.   Sign here.""

&lt; FX : scratchy pen noises &gt; 

""And this is the purchase order instructing SiteManager to hire in equipment and people to move the XYZData rack through the revised door horizontally and then stand it up again in compliance with OHS.  At ABC Corp.'s expense.""

""Sign here and here.""

Kicker :  The forklift and other equipment doing the job was going to wind up in just about everybody's way for a couple of hours, as well as not be being available for other work.  So the move was scheduled to actually happen late one Friday night when most crews were long gone.  Now I'm not insinuating anything, but the rack could actually have been tipped over and carried through the door fairly easily by say four or five people, even if OHS didn't like it.  And a thousand split four ways is more than decent beer money for the rest of the weekend.

Kicker 2 : Guess what size ABC Corp. had chosen for their own server racks?",talesfromtechsupport
t3_crb6u0,"""Yes, Ma'am, I'll let my supervisor know how our 8 minute software update put your entire family at risk.""","So, I work with home security systems. Like any modern smart devices, our equipment sometimes requires updates to the software so our customers can avoid known issues as we discover and patch them out. One of the cool little features our equipment has is that when it updates, it does so in the background until it needs to reboot to install the new software. This reboot normally takes a few minutes to complete and most customers won't even notice as the system returns to it's last armed or disarmed state. During those few minutes the system is rebooting, it is basically inactive. This customer had just so happened to be coming home during those minutes and then called us to complain that her home was ""completely unprotected for the entire time I was away, anybody could have broken in and you wouldn't know!"" I look at the system history and explain to her that according to our records, the entire process from when it started to when she called us to complain and then disarm it was less than 8 minutes. She says that I'm obviously incompetent and don't know what I'm talking about and demands that I pass her complaints to my manager as she feels this is unacceptable and that her home could've been broken into. In broad daylight. Within less than 8 minutes. With interior motion detectors that even if somebody had the perfect timing to get in during the reboot, would have detected them once inside and sounded the alarm. She then demands to be CC'd on this internal email chain, which I inform her I cannot do for company policy, but I still offer to email her separately afterward to let her know her feedback was passed along. She then yells at me and says that I can and will CC her and that she works in IT so she knows how it works and hangs up. I keep my word and email her complaints as best as I can without laughing and still keep my promise to email her afterward. She then emails me back that I did it wrong, and demands my supervisor and my area managers names. Due once more to company policy, I cannot disclose any information about other employees and was advised by another sup to just not bother replying and let her call back if she really feels a need to. I really do try not to revel in the unhappiness of unpleasant customers, but on rare occasions like this, I just can't help the smile on my face imagining what her next irate call will sound like.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_crbmeb,The little VM that couldn't (and some SQL on the side),"This came up last week but only thought about writing it here tonight. Long time lurker, infrequent poster (around 75% of my ""stories"" would be devs being nonsensical).

I've recently begun an internship in a moderately big business group of my region, with my job being to use Python to develop process-facilitating tools. Sort of important note: I'm normally closer to a sysadmin than to a dev.

It's the beginning of the month of August, and us three interns are making good progress on our respective tools (in a nutshell, they're making APIs, I'm making the software to use them). Boss asks us to try testing in something that would be closer to prod than our current testing/development environment, so I spin up a basic virtual machine with as close a configuration as I can get to the actual production environment. So basically around 1/8th of its power. But at least the OS is right, so we'll all take it.

All the apps are put on the server through the arcane magic of git, only thing missing is the database. Boss gives us a truncated backup of the production DB, it's nothing but your average SQL file, what could go wrong right ? So I go ahead and import the file. Except it doesn't import and spits out a syntax error on line 1.

At this point, I'm cursing in various different languages simultaneously, because the MySQL shell reports an error on an SQL command that isn't anywhere near close to line 1 (and in fact occurs several times in the file, with a few of the occurences having a line number in the lower five digits long). To not help matters further, MySQL only says there is a syntax error; not *which* syntax error, and only some vague hints about where to look (other than line ""1""). The script, in the meantime, is thoroughly checked by our local SQL shaman, to no avail. There is no logical reason the script would fail, especially with a syntax error.

I go have a smoke, during which I am enlightened. Figuratively and literally, as the summer sun seems to have made the ambitious plan of melting both my flesh and my retinas today. Once I come back inside, after letting my eyes adjust to the (absence of) lighting of the abode of the IT dept, I wrest control of my machine from the other interns (who at this point in time are considering a blood sacrifice -- a practice that I clarify to them is only to be used for printers), stare into the soul of my VM, and cast an elementary cantrip that I don't think to use often enough: `df -h`.

Lo and behold, root is full at roughly 98%. The fragment of the database, while being a fragment, was too big to fit in the remaining space. Not really wanting to cherry pick which part of the system lives and dies, I decide to merely resize the virtual disk image. Only to have *that* fail too.

...I don't really have a climactic end to this tale. To tell you the truth I declared that I solved enough weird [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] for one day, gave up and recreated the VM from the ground up, with twice as much disk space than we originally estimated. The SQL file worked instantly, and in a weird twist, the painful part was rebuilding the running environment of our respective programs rather than anything SQL related we did for the remainder of that day.

And I still don't know why would MySQL report a syntax error when it was absolutely not a syntax error.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cr80mq,Failure to prepare on your part means I get to go home early.,"I had posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/cqegq7/ultra_rude_clients/) as a comment and was told I should post it as a full story.  So I'm pasting it here and will try to add some details.

Previously I worked for a Print/Copy/Shipping company, I was there nearly 2 decades from front line employee eventually ending as local IT.  This is a tale from when I was an Assistant Manager of a location but asked to assist with an IT rollout.  I had a District Manager who loved me, he liked how I was with customers and my problem solving skills.  I also had a Regional Tech who knew I was computer literate.  It was summer many years ago, maybe early 2000's, which was the slowest time of the year for my location  I was asked to help roll out a major software upgrade. This upgrade was a complete re-image of the primary and any secondary production computers. Computers that processed the print jobs that was the bread and butter of the company.  This was given to two Assistant Managers who were at slow stores, as the corporate provided instructions were out of order, missing information or outright incorrect.  I literally crossed out whole pages of instructions and wrote new steps in some places.  We had a special training session to ""update"" the instructions so we could properly image and set up the computers.  If I remember correctly this was an upgrade from Win98 to XP along with a major update to how jobs were processed.

There were a few pre-requisites:

* All customer files need to be backed up (The ghost image literally would wipe all of the drives to set up a local retention drive)

* I needed access to the server (I don't recall why, it was a small patch we had to run on the local server)

* There should be a list of all printers with their IP addresses (Each location would have 4-6 printers)

The install took 3-4 hours on the primary machine (restoring the data) and 2-3 on the secondary machines. You had to have the primary machine at least complete with the imaging before you could start a secondary.

These visits were scheduled over the course of a few weeks.  I would do a couple of store visits, then work at my normal store the rest of the week.  I think I had something like 9 stores to do.  I'd show up at 7 or 8am at a store, verify the pre-requisites were done, then commence the install.

This all goes good for a couple of weeks, I'm at my last install. It's a Friday, I'm due back at my store on Monday. I walk in at 7am and nobody knows why I'm there. I go to the primary computer and there's a note from one of the assistant managers that the backup was left running overnight.  Of course it wasn't completed, they were burning CDs of the data rather than use the built in mini tape drive.  On top of that there's no printer information. I get a call from the assistant manager who was doing all of this and he told me that it was last minute because he found out from the manager the night before.

This was a medium sized store so I only had 2 computers to image.  So  I finished the backup while going around and getting the printer info. That was about 45 minutes of work, not too bad. I go to the server room and it's locked, have someone get the keys from the lockbox, and of course there's no key.  So the store starts calling the manager and he isn't answering his phone and I know the managers are supposed to meet with the District Manager that day for a meeting.

I called the Regional Tech and she told me to call the DM, tell him what happened and I could wait if I wanted to or I could walk out and get paid for the day.  I call the District Manager and leave a message for him letting him know what was going on.  The manager finally calls and says he has the key but it'll be an hour to an hour and a half for him to get to the store. He then tried to argue that he didn't have enough notice that this was happening.  The managers were literally told a month in advance and I emailed each store I was scheduled for on Sunday with my schedule for the week. I called the DM back and he picked up from his car.  I let him know what happened since he hadn't had a chance to listen to my voicemail, how the Regional Tech said I could leave and get paid since the instructions weren't followed and my conversation with the manager. His response was ""I will handle him (the manager). Thank you for your help. Sorry for wasting your time."" I called the Regional Tech back and let her know about my conversation with the DM and she said she'd re-schedule the store with the other Assistant Manager.

By this point it was close to 10:30am, hadn't done much.  I hung around for another half hour and then called some friends who worked in the area to see if they wanted to get lunch and left.  I found out later that the store manager showed up shortly after I left.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_cr9sob,Years in IT doesn’t make all of us wiser,"Ive been in IT for almost 10 years and  what I experienced a few weeks back just made me realize why I actually dislike my job. Not because of what I do or the work given to me but the level of incompetence I deal with. This might be more a rant than just a story but you can judge where you think my level of tolerance sits at. I’ve had my share of users but when the people that work with you are worse than the users... well, let’s move on.

To start our story I work in a big corporate business. We get occasional training paid for by the company that ensures we are knowledgeable in what we do. Me and my colleagues started off years ago as IT techies. They all have been around for 15 years or longer as desktop support and general office IT. Real easy basic stuff to help users with their daily functions, troubleshooting and doing PC repairs. At some point business agreed we will only do server admin work and not Desktop support anymore as that will be outsourced. Fabulous to be honest because we automatically moved into better positions due to our business and in-house software knowledge and years of experience in IT. Unfortunately this can’t be said for all of us...

Now my one colleague, we shall call him John, has been there long before me and you would expect John to be on top of his game for being there for so long. Very social and nice guy all around but heaven forbid, you’d swear what he learned a year ago is brand new to him now. My biggest gripe is that he is the most technologically illiterate techie I’ve met in my whole life yet here he is managing servers. He has no grasp of learning technical stuff by himself and can barely use office applications but use them daily. He can’t google as he has no idea what to type in as search patterns or how to sift through the garbage that google spills on you after you put in your search criteria. You might have a faint idea where this is going.

No, this won’t be a tale of how he brought servers down but he was quite close to often enough yet I got him out of that unfortunate scenario a few times. My tolerance for incompetence in the position some people are put without proper evaluation is very low.

So one morning John and me were off to go get breakfast after John was on first call doing needed server checks. Each week an admin is assigned to do server and system health checks starting from 5:45am and once done they can go get breakfast in the canteen that opened an hour later. I asked if one of the basic checks were done before we go eat just to ensure everything was done before our supervisor came in to ask the same question and get a surprise that ends up with us all getting a warning if not done.
John who was busy following me, halted in his tracks and then sprinted back to his workstation to obviously do what I just asked. So I said I’ll hang ten while he finishes. Something that literally takes a few seconds of opening an email and comparing specific outputs. Then he just sits there... and me knowing John, this isn’t good. I asked what’s taking so long? Him pointing at the screen and saying 2 of the replication servers aren’t in sync according to the email. I roll my eyes and asked him what he must do next? He stares at the screen blankly with no answer.
My first level of tolerance is being tested this morning, I could feel it. This stuff and the needed procedure to check it is documented and we been doing this for over a year now. How the hell does he not know this? So I step through with him from our wiki page as if he is brand new candidate. God help me.

Last step if both servers are in sync is to take a snap of it and reply with it on the email where it said otherwise to prove nothing is wrong.
So John, using Windows snap, takes a snap but instead of just the part that’s needed he takes a full screen shot. I tell him to do just a cropped snip to focus and show what on screen must be looked at upon which he replies his snipping program is broken, IT must come fix it. My eyes roll 360 degrees in my socket almost. 1st he needs to just configure snip to draw a rectangle for the snip and he has full rights as admin himself if he needed to install stuff - he himself was once a support technician - why call desktop support? I help here again because John is incapable to fix snap, the same stuff he should be able to help users with looking at his “supposed skill level”

Next, a common thing even users ran into which I remind you, we often assisted with years ago: pasting the snip or screenshot into an email. Yes, John couldn’t get this done. Why? Well if your email is set to text you can’t paste media obviously so you change it to html format. This was strike 3 of testing my patience in the span of 10min in asking myself how this guy still is able to work as Server Admin.

With mail corrected, snip pasted and email sent I breath a sigh of relief as my first hour at work just barely passed and I had to deal with this... really?
I felt like the gods were testing me to see my level of being patience those few minutes.
Upon return from breakfast our supervisor just walked in and sat at their desk for 5 minutes before asking the same question I did.

Wow, what a goddamn coincidence! Saved by sheer luck itself this morning for John. We could answer all is in order and confirmation email was sent by John. He just barely missed a warning if it was found out it wasn’t done or that he couldn’t even do such a basic check for the past year yet he ticked the step off everyday. I won’t even go into that...

I could also mention how basic functions like keeping a share name in place and moving it to another drive to make space does not logically cross his mind when recreating it - and he’s been doing this since the Server 2003 days.

Still a great guy but some people I believe must be periodically evaluated for their work skills as well and not just for being a nice person. Being nice will not bring those millions back when a server keels over due to incompetence.

t3_cqu6co,I have no clever title for this post. My brain just broke.,"This is a tale of network admins, sys admin, developers, and infosec bros who all tried to flex for a C suite and ended up falling on their asses. No need to epic tales today. No embellishments. No dramatic pauses. Today I am simply going to retell the tale of how my brain got flipped right up side down. 

Bright and early at 8 AM a request comes in to have the paper replaced in an MFP. Now why the person didn't just replace it themselves? That is beneath them... 

Well anywho someone else in the office replaced the paper with one from the counter. Problem solved so I closed the ticket. 

Thirty minutes ago a ticket was directly assigned to me and I was told to resolve the issue. 

At 8:32 AM a C suite sent out an email to the ITALL email group that her printer was suddenly printing strange characters. Every single paper she printed had the same strange characters. 

At 8:42 notes were left in the ticket by the VP over IT that he redid the printer drivers and reinstalled citrix onto her machine. It still happened. 

At 9:03 AM the C suite responded back that several people in the office were reporting the same issue. Strange characters on the print job.

At 9:12 the deskside team reported that they replaced the laptop unit for the C suite person as a test and it failed. 

At 9:35 the system admin reported that he had gone in and verified that there was nothing malicious in the network connection. 

At 10 AM the ticket was forwarded to purchasing to have the printer replaced. A purchase order was prepared and sent off for authorization to the CIO. He took one look at it and decided to work on the printer himself. 

At 11:32 AM the ticket was forwarded to the citrix engineers team to see what was wrong with the citrix server. Everyone was printing the same strange characters and it must be an issue with the citrix environment. 

At 12:05 a note was left by a citrix engineer who reported that the citrix environment is not causing it. They printed to another printer in the building and it did not print the special characters they are seeing. He forwarded it back to purchasing. 

At 12:45 it was forwarded to CIO who instantly forwarded it onto the support team. It was auto assigned to me by my boss who told me to just get it fixed. No reason to replace a &gt; $1k printer over something like this. 

I email one of the people and ask them to email me back a picture of what the special characters look like. 

At 1:09 PM an audible ""Oooooh.... MY GOD!!!"" Can be heard from my desk. I get up and walk into the printer room and see the head of purchasing and the CIO both discussing the printer. Its an expensive printer and they do not want to replace it if they do not have to. One of the network admins is in there talking with the sys admin who looks at me and tries to shoo me away. ""We got it."" 

""Clearly you don't."" Escaped my mouth before I realized I said it out loud. I suppressed the panic attack as everyone is looking at me now. I walk over to the printer and open tray 1. I pull out the paper that has the festive border of streamers, ribbons, fireworks, and hotdogs around the edges. 

""This is the leftover party paper from the 4th of july office bash."" I said as I laid the paper on the counter. I pulled a fresh ream of paper from the stack on the right of the printer and loaded it in. Everyone in the room just quietly walked out without a word and went back to their desks/offices. 

I closed the ticket with the notes. ""Someone replaced the normal paper with the left over party paper from the 4th of july bash. Closing.""",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cr71kf,How I remembered why I hate Boot Camp,"I'm the IT guy for a mid sized company. We do catering for bigger companies or highend private events. Therefore the tech we use (visible for the clients) must look nice.

(This is going to be some sort of a rant, so apologies in advance.)

A couple of years ago (before my time) some genius had the idea to buy a couple of iMacs. Because they look cool. The then IT guy agreed, because although we run everything in a windows domain with AD, Exchange, the works, you can install windows via boot camp and no problems because apple. Yes, they were convinced, that this was a brilliant idea.

Some time later, I was a trainee, they bought a couple more. iMac late 2013. And because I'm the trainee, it was my job to install windows on them.

I fought my way through this particular hell. It took me two days researching and try and error to figure this out. On the third I was able to install the three iMacs (after help from some cool apple msp dudes, one of whom I spend nealy two hours on the phone with troubleshooting).That was the day I decided to never ever agree to install windows again on a new apple device. (Well, I broke that once. But when your boss comes up and tells you to do something, there's only so much you can do as a trainee...)

Today, a good five years later, I remembered why I hated the process. One of the users with the last three iMacs complained that it took almost 10 minutes for the iMac to boot, for a couple of days in a row now and the USB ports are acting up for a while now. He had a two weeks vacation comming up and I decided to do a clean reinstall of OS X and Windows 7.

So, I back everything up and do a proper backup and away we go. Boot into OS X, delete the windows partition and update the OS. Ran the boot camp assistant. Oh. They only support Windows 10 now. Great... format the drive and reinstall whatever OS the iMac came with (Yosemite).

The rest of the day I spent rerunning the process and driving around town to gather what I needed. Only had a USB3 drive, so needed to buy a USB2 or Windows 7 throws a fit. Then it turned out the assistant wanted you to have a dvd (now I think about it, I may have misread something). So I had to borrow a super drive from someone (because I started to remember some of the BS of the process and I didn't want to use a non-apple device just in case it decides to throw another fit). At the end of day 1 the setup ran and I went home.

Day 2. I come in, look at the iMac. Won't boot because a certification error of a .sys file. It automatically downloaded the one Boot Camp version with uncertified files... Super... The next couple of hours were spent putting out fires, because after two weeks with next to no people in the office (because vacation time), suddenly everyone (of the 10-15 present) had urgent problems, while simultaneously finding the right boot camp drivers (because there's only one version that works and if you don't use that specific one... error message for you. And tell you what, it's not the latest one supporting windows 7).

The neccessary proccess, if you don't know, for a generation or two of apple devices, is that you needed to recreate a very specific constellation to be able to install windows via bootcamp. The thumbdrive with Boot Camp needs to be in the leftmost port viewed from the front, the Windows setup medium needed to be in rightmost. Not both on the same drive and don't you dare plug in something other than those two things. You needed to have a bluetooth mouse and keyboard, otherwise drivered weren't loaded properly and no setup for you.

So, after almost two days of headache, I remembered why I hate boot camp... Because it's ... moody at best.

Thank goodness I was able to talk them out of this nonesense of buying macs just to put windows on them. I don't care if they improved upon the bootcamp process. Either you use OS X or you get a proper windows machine...",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cr40r7,Unofficial USPS IT guy - 3,"My friend is a mail carrier. Like other carriers, he has to carry a scanner with him. A notice was sent of and read to become familiar with the new features.

He looked at the symbols and looked through the menus. 

Several safety messages had been sent to test the text messenger. One day he was in a mood. The text message read something along the lines of “safety is an important. Work safe. That is the reality of our job”

There were preset text to reply to messages saying you received the message. Responding is mandatory. You can’t exit without responding. Otherwise the message will keep coming up. At the bottom of the response messages, there is create you own.

t3_cr2rgm,Can you take a look at this script ?,"Hello TFTS,

A short story that happened a few days ago, and I think it definitely has its place here. Our organization's $CISO called me directly to ask if I could check some PowerShell script written by another guy... but as you'll see, his request was more special than you can think.


&gt; *Phone rings*

&gt; $Me: Hello, $Me speaking.

&gt; $CISO: Hello $Me, are you by any chance familiar with some daily extracts performed from the Active Directory and then sent to $SomeBusinessApp ? $CIO also told me you were familiar with PowerShell ?

&gt; $Me: Yes, I'm aware of these extracts, what about them ?

&gt; $CISO: Apparently, some informations are missing from the extracts and it would seem that they're done with a PowerShell script written by $SomeOtherGuy, would you mind to take a look at it ?

&gt; $Me: I don't exactly provide support for PowerShell scripts, or script and programming and general, especially with scripts written by someone else...

&gt; $CISO: Yeah I get it, sure, but just to take a look and check if you don't see anything missing or that could explain why some data are missing, you know ?

&gt; $Me: If it's only to take a quick look, and nothing more, then alright. Can you provide me the script ?

&gt; $CISO: Actually... I don't have it myself.

&gt; $Me: So you know who has it ? The script's author, maybe ?

&gt; $CISO: He's actually on vacation until September so, he wouldn't be able to provide it.

&gt; $Me: So, do you know if it's actually stored on a server, a shared directory or maybe do you have at least, a screenshot of the script ?

&gt; $CISO: I don't know, and no, I don't have any screenshots.

&gt; $Me: *Remains silent for a good 30 secs, and then...* Well, I can't really check a script I don't have and that you can't provide me, so... I'm sorry but I won't be able to help you here.

TL;DR =&gt; CISO calls me and ask to check a PS script written by someone else because some data extracted from AD by the script are now missing. When I asked him to provide me the script, it turns out he doesn't have it, he doesn't know where it may be stored or who may have it, and the script's author is on vacation until September.

t3_cr3uj5,A VERY expensive phone cord,"backstory: I work at a very small ISP that offers DSL internet, at the time of the story I had been working in the support call center for about 1.5 years (I think). nothing is embellished in fact i left out many vulgarities since they were gross and also may not remember them exactly. Anyways rewind to 5 months prior and I had my first run in with ** customer** so I knew when we were dealing with a total idiot once i realized who he was later.




**OP**&gt;hello IT


**customer**&gt; my internet is SO slow. You need to fix it!


**OP**&gt; okay, what are the speeds your getting?


**customer**&gt; TOO SLOW CANT STREAM NETFLIX






I politely ask him to run a speedtest, we even have a speedtest server in house. And he indeed was getting slow speeds. About 6/10 mbps. And I can see total upload saturation. (Usually cloud backup). I tell him this and he doesn’t buy it. Nothing could ever be his fault.






**OP**&gt; do you have a laptop with an Ethernet port? Let’s try directly connecting your laptop and disconnecting your netgear (for his wifi)


**customer**&gt;so what I’m hearing is you don’t support net neutrality?!





I’m totally confused at this point shrug his weirdness off and state that in fact yes our **company name** fully supports net neutrality.





**customer**&gt; *scoffs* okay its connected it says 11mbps


**OP**&gt; great! I’m glad to hear that! 





Cue 5 minutes of me explain 3rdy party equipment and if he uses his own wifi equipment I can’t provide the same level of support than if he just used the router/modems built in wifi. He doesn’t believe me and the call ends with him being able to stream again.





5 MONTHS LATER





A co-worker I enjoy working with was on shift that night it’s the evening shift. She was new to the call center but I don’t think this was her first call center job. I usually half listened to all my coworker’s calls so in case I picked up something they didn’t I could offer a fresh perspective, or I learn something myself. I listen to what my coworker was telling the **customer** and everything seemed normal; slow speeds *have you tried turning it off and on again* ETC. I tune out and go back to scrolling.






25ish minutes go by and she’s still in the call, which in our call center we don’t worry about lengthy calls. Just that progress is being made and that the problem is solved, this is because we serve many elderly and have to go slow sometimes. I disregard and figure its problem some nice old person that can’t find their router (frequent “I don’t have a router”).





I hear a **coworker** in a less spunky tone than usual&gt; hey, **OP**? Can you take this call for me?


*She’s nearly in tears*


**OP** the nerd to the rescue!&gt; of course transfer him!





I ask what is going on and leave him in call queue limbo for a moment and pull up his info. She goes on to explain how he won’t listen to her and keeps saying how she clearly doesn’t know what she’s talking about and keeps saying he needs someone who knows more (while at the time I was more knowledgeable than her with computers and networking, this call was so far well within anyone’s in the call center’s capabilities that I knew **customer** was full of crap). How he’s basically putting her down for being a woman, huffing a lot and despite everything the problem persists with his connection. And then how he became a whirlwind of profanities and blaming the company for having a terrible product and it’s all our fault.



I crack my knuckles and take a deep drink of the go juice. Looking back this was my first tech support call fueled by spite and malicious compliance. This guy was a bigot and I was going to piss him off as best as I could by throwing the book at him. No one gets to treat my shift-mates like that. *Cue montage music* before I released him form limbo, I checked some things to try to paint the picture of what the hell could be happening. I looked at his ping time from our center to his router, it was acceptable delay time when it did check in but was only making the round trip about 50% of the time. So low latency but his packet loss. I looked at his actual connection strength (attenuation, margins, retrains etc) from the DSL equipment’s port to the router, and something was fuckey. And I had a feeling **coworker** had covered her bases and he might need a ticket or a router swap. 






I take **customer** out of the clutches of our dry hold music.
In my most considerate voice possible&gt;**company name** tech support, my name is **OP** how can I help you?



**customer** was now suddenly very calm and polite but seemed like he was on edge. So I start at the basics. He explained his problem and how its SO important that he gets it working again.


**OP**&gt; have you tried turning it off and on again?
Audibly taken aback at me asking him that&gt; of COURSE I have, do you think I’m STUPID? 
Knowing he surely doesn’t want the real answer, in a grossly positive and helpful tone I respond&gt; no of course not, we just need to go through all the steps, I don’t believe anything until I see it! And your connection seems funky so let’s start from the ground up
**customer**&gt; well we don’t need to, I KNOW what’s wrong already. It’s your guy’s crappy lines. I’ve had trouble since the day you installed!


*hmmm, you don’t say* I then quickly start to look at his documented history farther back than before


**OP**still 100% enthusiasm&gt; oh that DOES sound frustrating! Did you call?






I then continue forcing him to do every basic troubleshooting step there is (as per required before a ticket can be submitted hehehe) and can now see that he complained before (4 month prior) but refused to pay the company for the trip or time so we only check up to his Demarc. And his connection from the Demarc directly to us was BEAUTIFUL, exceeding speeds of 90mbps download. (I was slightly envious as I can only get 30mbps max at home using my aggregating router)





During trouble shooting now his connection dropped and no matter what I do it won’t comeback





**customer**&gt; yes you guys even came out. But wasted your time and didn’t fix ANYTHING.  (He didn’t let us)



**OP**&gt; was it just like this before?



**customer**&gt; NO it was slow and shitty before! But now you’ve broken it! And you will fix it before 7PM!





At this point I had done everything phone trouble shooting could accomplish (30 minutes due to his attitude). He blew his top when I told him that it’s going to be one of three things, his modem/router, the inside wiring of the house itself (after the Demarc) which he would have to pay for ** customer** blew up even more at the thought, or it would be the lines before the Demarc. He was PISSED and refused to listen that if it was past the Demarc it was not company property and he would be financially responsible for any rewiring done inside the walls of the house.





**customer**&gt; THEY ARE YOUR LINES YOU INSTALLED THEM! NOT ME! IM NOT PAYING FOR YOUR SHITTY WORK!





Next up was either swapping the modem/router for FREE because he could come to our building and we can hand them out as long as the old one is returned (call center 24/7).  Or a trouble ticket is placed and an installer goes on the next available day (usually next day for irritated customers). And looking at the time it was 5:30 PM





**OP**&gt; okay ** customer** I don’t think we will be able to get it working by then unle-


**customer**&gt; YES you WILL. You WILL call one of your tech people and have they come fix it by 7PM! 

 
**OP**&gt; look ** customer** we have done everything we can on the phone the only next step you could take is if YOU drive here and swap out your router and its cords for a new one.  Or we submit a ticket and looks like there is an opening for tomorrow. There’s no fee for the swap if you come by and-


**customer**&gt;so you’re going to deliver a router before 7PM?!


**OP**&gt; no you have to come pick one up


**customer**&gt;well IM not doing THAT, **company name** can come out and do it!


**OP**&gt; sure can, tomorrow in our next available slot


**customer**&gt; so what your telling me is that **company name* is interested and reimbursing me?





I was SO confused at this point at he was talking about. He sounded like I was supposed to be afraid. It was also this phrase that made me realize he was net neutrality guy LOL.





**customer**&gt; my wife has a VIDEO CALL scheduled for 7PM and we had to pay a lot of money to schedule it.  If you don’t fix your shitty internet by then and we miss the call **company name** is going to pay for it!




**OP**&gt; in here we are just tech support for billing questions you will have to talk to our billing department during business hours. 


**customer** refuses to accept this and we go in circles of “it’s YOUR fault FIX it!” He eventually gives up and I was able to schedule at ticket. I sling an email off to my supervisor and our CO department so they know what to expect in the morning. The CO supervisor had not left yet, I walk over and explain verbally why this ticket was extra special.






I wheel back over to **coworker** who now looks much less distressed and I spill ALL the hilarious and petty details.







THREE DAYS LATER






It was **coworker** and I again, she was back from her weekend and she asks what happened to ** customer**. TBH I had almost forgotten he existed. I pull up the ticket and it looks like he was very rude to our installers that went onsite, TWO very senior installers went. And using the through notes I left they started with the simple thing. 


They replaced the 4ft phone cord going from the phone jack to the modem/router. BINGO internet fixed and speeds back to nominal. He is billed for the full charge for the trip (usually if the call takes less than a few minutes the installer will waive the minimum service fee and labor charge. But in the end it up to the installers discretion). Meaning he payed nearly $200 for a phone line he could have had for free before 7PM the night of the call. We both laugh to near tears and drink more coffee in celebration. We usually NEVER get such a satisfying outcome.
   

I’m pretty sure this is the customer that made me realize how much I love talking to the angry customers. I’m pretty bored at work and angry ones are usually a hilarious change of pace; since its almost always easy fixes.
    

also a few days later **coworker** and I both get a talking to about he appropriate time to end a call due to abusive customers

t3_cr4dd8,The Cable Guy borks existing service,"(my first post to TFTS.  Apologies for poor formatting and lack of dialog.)

Setting the scene: Multi-site retailer is in a multi-year project to refresh its network equipment and change managed service providers. I'm a contract tech who has worked with the outgoing MSP#1 for many years and also take service work for MSP#2. 

Existing service is some sort of DSL, with VoIP provided by MSP#1.

MSP#2 contracts with a local cable company to install the new internet service, so cable guy comes out and installs a new modem, but doesn't touch the existing setup.  He runs the direct burial coax around the property to the utility pole, telling the store manager that someone will be out to bury the cable a few days later.  So far, so good.

Cable guy with trenching tool comes out to bury the cable, cuts the buried DSL line in the process. Store loses phone service, and their network kicks over to satellite backup, which is slow as molasses.  

A couple weeks later, DSL provider comes out and runs a new cable along the ground to replace the cable cut by the cable guy and tells store manager that someone will be out to bury that cable.

(This story would be funny if the DSL cable trenching guy cut the cable, but it hasn't happened. Yet. Give them time.)

MSP#1 dispatches me a couple days later because one of the routers is offline and they can't get into the VoIP server. I find that the router/firewall device is offline due to an unseated power cord and the VoIP server is unreachable because the firewall was left enabled on the DSL modem, blocking inbound connections.  Two simple fixes.

While I'm on site, delivery company drops off the new analog telephone adapter (ATA) for MSP#2's phone service.  MSP#2 will send someone out to do that work.  I'll only see it if the installer screws up and I get sent out to fix it, which has happened for other stores in this chain.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cqz1w9,The mystery deleter strikes!,"A bit of context- I work for a company that provides software for clinical trials and Pharmaceuticals. This means we have some pretty strict regulations, and it also means we don’t get to upgrade our tools without massive levels of overhead. This translates to using workarounds or subpar programs because they are already validated. 

Story time. There was a Quality Assurance Manager with all sorts of letters after her name that proclaimed herself as a “Software Expert”.   You all know the type- takes every cert possible, no practical knowledge at all. Aka- good on paper. 

At the time, she was using an excel spreadsheet to handle tracking some data/issues. One of her poor staff entered new information in, and she couldn’t see it.

I ask the Analyst if she saved, she confirms; ok next step, ask her to do it again, just in case. She does. I ask Alphabet Soup to reopen the excel document, she rolls her eyes spews some nonsense, and does. Sure enough - the new info isn’t there. We start to check- show me the file you’re opening. She goes to a shortcut on her desk- file names match however I catch the problem.

t3_cqzjya,"That won't be covered under your service plan, sir.","*I'm going to put a bit of a warning on this one;  I'll keep it as Safe for Work as possible, but, there is a bit of an ick factor.  Those with weak constitutions may wish to sit this one out.*

This tale dates back a bit to my days as a CCTV &amp; alarm installer.  I was roaming about the area handling service / break fix calls for things like non-working cameras, dirty lenses, bad door sensors, and other such simple issues.

&amp;#x200B;

It was an unusually warm summer day, with only the lightest of breezes to provide any relief.  The aircon in my service truck was only just keeping up, and I was already a bit of a sweaty mess when, around mid morning, I was radio dispatched to a high priority call.  The site manager for the local housing authority had called regarding the cameras and door entry being inoperative in one of their buildings in a rather run down bit of the city.

&amp;#x200B;

The only information I had been provided by dispatch was that all of our equipment was offline and not responding to remote reboot or diagnostic commands.  I made my way inside, having retrieved a set of keys from the management office, and and headed for the basement.  Upon opening the door to the basement stairwell, I was hit with a stench that could only be emanating from the depths of hell itself.  It was a hot, thick, evil smell.  I paused for a moment and double checked that this was, in fact, the door to the basement stairwell, and not a similarly marked door to the innermost depths of Satan's back passage.

&amp;#x200B;

Nope... It's the basement door alright.  Sucking in a lungful of fresh (-ish) air, i headed down. As i rounded the final bend, I came upon a site that haunts me to this day.  The bottom four or five feet or so of the stairs were submerged in a very dark, and somewhat lumpy fluid.  The basement was a massive lake of poo.  I Sir Robin'd right out of there (that is to say, bravely turned my tail and fled) back to the relative safety of my service truck, and radio'd the office.  As I was patiently explaining to dispatch the gravity of the situation, the site manager climbed up on my site step and tapped on my window to ask if the work would be covered under his service plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: *""No.  The service plan does not cover loss due to fecal inundation, I'm afraid.""*

&amp;#x200B;

I'd heard that once the basement was drained and access to it was possible again, it was determined that the sewage main had backed up and the pipe, unable to hold back that much pressure due to age, ruptured.   Every time a toilet was flushed or a sink or shower drain was used, anywhere in this 12 floor building, it ended up in the basement.  I did have to go back about two weeks later to remove the poo-encrusted DVR and alarm panel, re-terminate all the cables, and install new hardware.  I threw my gloves away.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_cqyej2,Unofficial USPS IT guy - 2,"A post office was getting a new computer to replace the old one. My friend was asked to stop in and check the setup because the postmaster was very unsure about computers.   She didn’t think she could set it up on her own and wanted help. 

When he walked in, she had already setup the computer. A picture diagram was sent with the computer. Looking the computer over and comparing to the diagram, it was set up just fine. 

The problem was the post office network was no longer working. The postmaster couldn’t access the information she needed to do her job. After troubleshooting the basic problems, there was nothing wrong with the setup. Postmaster called the help desk. 

She was then connected to a computer tech. My friend kept hearing I’m not sure, I don’t know, I think so, I don’t know. He asked if she wanted him to talk to the tech. She very quickly handed he phone over, practically yelling yes.  I don’t understand him. 

The conversation is written from his point of view. 

Cast   Friend - Op.  T - computer tech.  Postmaster-M

Op-Hello. 

T-Uh, yeah. What happened to the lady?

Op-My guess. She couldn’t answer your questions. So she passed the phone to me

T-And who are you?

Op-unofficially, I’m the local computer tech. 

T-There are no techs in that area. 

Op-I know, I said unofficially. I’m a local carrier who knows about computers so they ask for my help. 

T-Oh, ok. Is the computer set up CORRECTLY?

Op-Yes, it’s set up like the diagram. 

T-There was a diagram?

Op-Yes. And I made sure it was set up just like the picture. 

T-Tell me about the about the setup. 

Op-Ok. Round cable cord. 

T-Do you mean a coaxial cord. 

Op-Yes. Connected to modem. 

T-Ok

Op-Rectangular cord out of modem. Looks like a big phone cord. 

T-You mean a cat5 cord?

Op-Yes. That cord goes into the Postco box. 

T-Why are you calling it a Postco box. 

Op-That’s what it says on the side. It’s a router. 

T-Oh, ok. 

Op-Out of the Postco box and into the computer. 

T-(short pause) Well that’s stupid!

Op-Ok?

T-Why don’t you hook the coaxial cable to the Postco box?

Op-Because round plug doesn’t fit in square hole. 

T-Uh, then I don’t know. 

Op-Is there anyone else there that can help?

T-My boss is behind me but he’s on the phone. 

Op-When he gets off the phone, tell him xyz office can’t get on the network. 

T-Ok. Maybe we could . . . Oh, he just got off the phone. Hang on.  He says we have to reset it from our end.

Op-Ok. Well . . . 

T-Were working on it. All set. Check the connection 

Op-Yup, looks good here. Thank you. 

T-Anything else I can help you with 

Op-Nope. In the future, please keep in mind most post office employees are computer illiterate and don’t understand technical terms. 

T-Ok, I’ll try. Have a good day

Hanging up the phone, he let out a big sigh of relief. 

Op-That was so frustrating. 

M-I know. He was using words I didn’t understand. 

Op-It’s ok if your working with someone who’s on the same level. Most people in the post office are not computer savvy. I understood but I didn’t care for the technical terms. 

M-I know. Right. And I owe you a big thank you card. 

Op-Thank you.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cqwpy2,"User complains about issue, refuses solution","I do support for a small CRM on the side on occasion. I got a ticket because according to the user, when they send emails through the CRM, it always goes to spam.

**Me:** ME, **CX:** Customer

**CX:** Ok, I'm beyond frustrated. EVERY e-mail I send thru $CRM is going into spam folders. Clients I have e-mailed hundreds of times to new clients. With a new or old e-mail address. It seems to be ONLY when I send thru $CRM system that this is happening.

**Me:** Do you have proper SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records set up in your DNS? *I had already run a scan and knew the answer, this just lets me know what kind of person I'm working with.*

**CX:** Everything is set up fine on my end. I can send them straight from my e-mail and clients get them. I send the same client an e-mail thru $CRM dashboard, and it goes to spam.

**Me:** Exactly. You have to set up those records (I checked, they’re not set up on your domain) in order to send through other sites or systems.

**CX:** I use Gmail addresses.

**Me:** So you don't have a branded email address?

**CX:** I do. And it's 13 years old, and not what I want to use any longer. This isn't a business lesson. We do lots of business. This is a ""gmail accounts shouldn't automatically be marked spam, while using a system like $CRM"" lesson. IMO

**Me:** Typically using a consumer email address to send mail through a CRM or email campaign platform will result in spam flags. You really should be using a branded email address, especially if you already have one, along with proper SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records.

**CX:** I don't plan on using my branded email with $CRM any time soon.

**Me:** That is your choice. I cannot force you to to do anything. I can only make suggestions.

t3_cr0ips,Realtor Stonewalled by Printer,"I'm starting to write this as I'm speaking with the client.  I am I (not Don Quixote) and him $CR for Clueless Realtor.

First time post in TFTS, 2nd ever on Reddit, new user, longtime lurker, native US English speaker, on PC, etc. etc.

TLDR at the Bottom

I get off work at 5pm, roll on home and make me some supper.  Shortly after 6pm (coincidentally when the last in-office technician leaves for the day).  My phone buzzes with an email notification - voicemail for the on call line.  Great, I'm still on call since the guy I was SUPPOSED to hand off the on call phone to was home sick.

I finished cooking and eating, then listened to the VM.  It's a realtor....great....these are either simple printer setups, or complicated printer setups.  Guess which one I drew?  We are primarily focused on small clinics, with a side of small businesses.  Among those small businesses are a number of realty teams, who are connected in name but supported separately.  Dozens of full time and part time realtors who are almost never in their home offices, though thankfully we only did active support for a few people.

$CR is part of a team that is run through a second team, the one we most directly support.  He called in from his home office with a printing issue he had been fighting for ""a while"", and had several documents that needed to be printed and arranged tonight.  I reach out to his direct cell, but have to call back because he's working on a few time sensitive emails.  Ten or fifteen minutes later I call again and we get started.

I thought I was walking into a driver mismatch, printer stuck in sleep mode, random connection error, or something of the like.  I wish that was the case.

A little background on $CR - he gets his designation from this call, and a previous call I only remember in a deja-vu like sense.  He speaks in a way that sounds like it's at the 75% speed you can set for YouTube videos.  Enunciated, slow, but not comical.  This is not an issue with an old printer, this was a new printer that was BARELY out of the box.  By $CR's admission, he has struggled with it for nearly two hours already.  He has managed to power it on and \*charge\* the ink.  That's it.  No drivers, no WiFi, no initial setup, nothing else.  Making things worse, our remote to connection to his computer (installed with a previous ticket) was slower than frozen molasses being pushed up-hill in the -50 degree winter we had here in MinneSnowta this past year.

Now, I've helped to remotely set up a variety of printers from unboxing to printing in my short time at this MSP.  What I haven't experienced to this extent is a user who has absolutely no idea what is going on.  I'm in a different city, working remotely.  $CR has to be my eyes, hands, and occasionally ears.  I can't see what they see, I can't physically interact with anything.  He asked if I did something on the printer or could see something several times during every single task item of each setup stage.  Every other line also included something about ""how good we are at computer issues"" or ""this is crazy"".

Keep in mind, ALL I've done so far is encourage him to plug it back in and set the language/date and time.  On his computer I install the drivers for this printer, which is smart enough to set itself up on the WiFi without needing a manual password or any physical intervention.  I've never worked with this type before - it's one of those where the ink comes in bottles and you fill the cartridge, then charge the printer.  I find a manual, but it's for a different model in the series.  Eventually I dig up the right manual on google, and even find a copy of the picture card that depicts basic physical setup.

After powering it on, connecting via WiFi, $CR swearing he charged the ink, struggling to find where to load the paper, we finally got to printing a test page.  Failed.  Printer manager pops up and its not recognizing any of the ink.  Great.

We're an hour and a half into this setup and we've accomplished MAYBE six minutes of work.  I skip past the test page window and go for the pending firmware update, hoping against hope it takes and magically resolves everything.  Firmware update completes and it didn't take forever.  Maybe I'm getting somewhere?  At that moment, that slim glimmer of hope, $CR decides we've spend enough time on it for the evening.  He has some family issues to address and asks if we can ""hookup on this"" again tomorrow night.  Now he's been as good as you can expect from someone labeled $CR.  Nothing was hostile or difficult (personality), just really really clueless.  In my infinite wisdom I agree to pick it back up tomorrow night, after work, when I'm not on call.  My co-workers do it all the time and to put this to rest I will too.

Possibly a Part 2 tomorrow if I get any interesting interactions and if anyone cares.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Clueless Realtor can barely unbox a smartypants printer, has no idea how anything works, and thinks that I - in another city - can see what he's doing and provide answers to problems I didn't know were problems in the first place.  Such as how the paper is loaded, when the printer comes with a picture card of how to do basic physical setup.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cqtp7k,Customer buys Cloud solution; Customer IT doesn't understand how cloud works.,"My background, for those that haven't heard it; I've been in Helldesk, then sysadmin, now I'm an Implementation specialist for a company that deals in Law Enforcement equipment and software.  We released a Cloud version of our software product last year which is quite good.  And now that I'm outside customer-service type I often get to regail you guys tales from customer IT tech support... like the time Customer IT deleted the [Virtual Hard Disk that contained their database](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/aplc1n/but_there_was_nothing_on_that_drive_famous_last/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).  

Anyway to keep this short and to the point, I was given a deployment for a new to cloud customer.  They're already using some of our products and the on-prem version of our software, but now making the leap to Cloud.  They delayed the install by four weeks and it's been assigned to one of my colleagues.  However, I've been a bit of a fly on the wall in my colleague's discussions with IT.  Remember, this is a CLOUD solution the customer purchased.  All their data and their access to it is through a web portal in Microsoft Azure.

$CustomerIT: What's to stop someone from just logging into this at McDonald's or Starbucks from a laptop?

$Colleague: They would first need to authenticate using their Azure AD credential

$CustomerIT: We get that, but what's stopping them?

$Me (while phone is on mute):  That's how the cloud works.  That's kind of the reason you buy a cloud-based service so that it can be accessed from anywhere anytime.

So there you have it, an IT team that doesn't quite understand the Cloud.  Most of our Law Enforcement customers go with the cloud so that officers can access the data from the MDC and not place extra load on VPN infrastructure.  Then there's all the other benefits of a cloud solution... but I digress.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cqrhtn,"""Added for Visibility""","Background: We’ve had a long standing performance problems with a few of our apps, mostly related to memory/CPU usage. It doesn’t affect everyone, but word gets around and users get… ideas about how their computer “should” work

I had a user who was reporting that their computer was running low on memory. So I went through the motions of setting up a time and collecting the data I needed. When I took a look at it there wasn’t really a memory problem; they have 16 Gb and most of the time they don’t even use 12. I cleaned up a few apps and make sure nothing is starting with the computer when it boots and send them on their way telling them to install the latest updates when they have a chance to reboot the computer (which they never did, in fact I doubt they did anything I asked them to as they probably weren’t reading my emails).

Not even a week later they tell me in a ticket that they have an important meeting and need a new computer urgently before a long weekend (Turns out they didn’t have any meetings that day or the next day they were in the office). They also copied all of the managers in the office, many of whom aren’t in their or my chain of command for “visibility”. We set them up with a loaner to help them with their non-existent demo with the expectation that it will be returned for their original laptop that we had just reimaged at the user's request. In my response to this I remove the extra people on the ticket and let them know we’ll need the loaner back within a week or so.

Then, their manager responds to the ticket, adding everyone again for “visibility” saying that the loaner fixed all of the non-existent RAM problems and that they’d like to keep it. I respond saying that we’ll need the loaner back and we need to finish troubleshooting to find the actual cause (which turned out to be the user wanted to have 50+ chrome tabs open at a time). I then remove the extra managers and respond telling them we need the loaner back and that we haven’t fixed the issue yet and the loaner won’t fix it long term. I also expressed how there are other users who have real problems with their laptops that we need to replace first.

Then I get this response:
“Adding [not my or their manager] and [not my or their manager] for visibility

I am not sure why we would give the computer back?”

And shortly there after the other two unrealted managers responded backing the user up saying they won't return IT's loaner.

*sigh* I really wanted to reply “Because you don’t own that computer and even if we replace it in the end we need it back” but it was clear this wasn’t going anywhere. Having yet to see any problem with their device, I copy my manager who chats with them and eventually sales management pushed a little harder and they ended up keeping the loaner laptop. I am seriously at a loss for this one, we *have* to provide data and evidence to back up our point and sales just needs to complain enough, and this isn’t the first time something like this has happened. Sometimes I wonder what my job even is other than to be a vending machine for sales.

I walk into my office, which really is a double wide closet... and I hear a knocking on the door. This guy has an issue, his laptop won't start.  I'm thinking ok, battery needs to be replaced.  Well it turns on, and it dies, it turns on and it dies.  Now I start looking at this laptop, it's an antique. We haven't given these out for years, none are supposed to be in the environment any more for at least two years. 

I ask where he got it from, he says his Mgr gave it to him once his other laptop died.  That of course leads to other questions, so I know for a fact he's not going to be able to transfer his data over, the flash drive on the new computers are the wrong type. I tell him that, he's not happy.  I asked if he backed anything to the cloud.  His answer is no... 

So, we have a dead computer, with a possibility of not recovering any data he has had on this computer (for the last 6 years) down the tubes... 

I take a breath, count to five and restrain myself from dope slapping this guy into next week. 

I give him a loaner, and tell him he needs to tell his Mgr he needs a new computer, I will attempt to collect his data, but there is no guarantee. 

This guy also has a nasty habit of  head rocking whenever he talks to us, as if he is talking to a child, and I want to restrain his head... and he only does it with people which he finds are under his station. So while he is taking to me, he is doing this head rocking, and I can feel the hairs on the back of my neck raise... grr...

I digress, so I plug in the HD, it doesn't show up at all, I try a few more things, I get it to be recognized, Bitlocker then kicks in, and I find the data. 

I recorded the laptop the computer that I gave him, and attempt to backdoor into it.  I contact him and ask him where the laptop is.  He isn't using it... he's using his old laptop. the one that the one I am working on replaced.  I asked him why he still had that laptop....of course I shouldn't expect anything different right now...

He tries to say some BS, and I ask him which laptop will he be using.  He states the one he is using now, I ask for that computer's name... and I backdoor into it, and send data over.  I make sure he backs up into the cloud, and everything else... I ask for the laptop back... he comes back, and hands me the old laptop...yes the one with the data I just transferred over, and he said it no longer is working.  

So now I am transferring his data back over as you read this...

t3_cqjinh,That time I thought I killed a guy over the phone,"This was circa 2000. Worked at a place that handled warranty calls for computers sold through [Popular Office Supply Chain].

Monday. It was already a bad day as we had a lot of calls about systems that would not turn on. Ended up being fried power supplies and motherboards from some really bad storms that had gone through the South over the prior weekend. These were usually easy to diagnose and you'd schedule a tech to go out and try to resuscitate the machine with a new power supply, but company policy required us to go through the standard idiot test first. ie: ""Is it plugged in? Is the monitor plugged in? Is the monitor on? Is the power outlet receiving power?""

So I we get through the first of those and I get to the last step which is to ask them to try plugging the computer into a different outlet. Guy says ""Ok, the computer is under the desk. Hold on a minute."" He puts his phone down on top of the desk and I don't hear anything as I imagine he's crawling under the desk to unplug the thing. About 30 seconds later I hear a loud crackle and pop sound along with the guy screaming. Then nothing. Silence. I swear 5 minutes went by, but I'm sure it was only another 30 seconds. I am screaming over my headset ""Sir? SIR?!"" I thought I just electrocuted this dude.

Finally he picks the phone back up and says that there was a lot of smoke and blue sparks that came out of the back of the computer when he plugged it back in. He was surprisingly chill about it. I guess near death experiences can do that...

t3_cqsuz9,The 3 hour tech call..,"Backstory- I was in the army working as an IT tech. Though I wore numerous hats, my office was under the help desk with a douche bag major. His take on trouble calls was- you were only supposed to be on them for 10 minutes. Never mind the fact that some calls took longer to walk a user through to come up with a solution.  We supported some very very remote locations (like need a helicopter to get to them because there is no road remote). The user in this story was a light colonel in a medical unit. He had been diagnosed with stage 3 melanoma and was going through chemo therapy.  He was a hard charger and continued to work remotely even though he was going through this treatment. Our office provided a laptop and cell phone so he could continue to work.

He was having trouble getting the laptop to connect to a wireless connection, so he could establish a VPN connection into milnet.

me- DOIM shop, SGT snuffy speaking

Fozy- It's LTC Fozy (not his real name), I'm having trouble with getting the laptop to make a connection.

me- Sir, let me call you back on my cell, so I can move freely and work the issue you have. (I went outside to pace the parking lot so I could focus on this one call)

me- Sir, where are you at right now?

Fozy- I'm at (army medical hospital) in my room. I see there's wifi here, but I can't get the laptop to connect to it.

me- Hmmm.. You see that little icon in the tool tray that looks like a radio tower in the lower left hand corner? Could you open that up for me? (we're working XP and this was before CAC usage)

Fozy- yes. I see it, opening. I see several access points.

me- can you right-click on one and connect?

Fozy- I did, it's not working. 

me- OK.. Hmmm.. Log out and we're logging back in locally with another account. (local admin account time)

Fozy- OK. Wifi is connected now. (success after pacing the parking lot for 3 hours on my cell with earbud trying to help a user with ""chemo brain"")

me- Great! Now fire up the VPN client and login with that. (user logs in and I can finish up the loose ends)

Fozy- I really appreciate you taking the time and patience with an old man that's not feeling his best. (he repeated this several times through the conversation)

me- Sir.. I can count on one hand. Officers that I truly love and respect. You are on that very short list. I understand your mind is a bit foggy from chemo, you do not have to apologize. If you have any further issues, please call this number day or night and I will help you to the best of my ability. He thanked me profusely and you could hear the emotion in his voice. (he called a couple times after hours, we were able to work through his issues and get him on track)

This was one of the longest support calls I've had. However, it was the most rewarding.  It was a point in time when a user who was kicked down, needed help the most.

t3_cq966p,"""Don't do this yourself, I'm a professional!""","A couple of years ago, I quit teaching. The hours sucked, the amount of work I did for the pay and recognition was no where near worth it and I'd never felt so worthless at the end of the academic year  than I did when I was a teacher. TL;DR, teaching sucked. Which really upset me.

So I decided I may as well stick to my degree and use it. After all, I did pay for it! I signed up with a job agency for an IT technician role; I had some experience from labs in uni in networking, I could manage AD, do all the usual 2nd line stuff and I was more often than not fixing issues with the school's computers myself as we had no in-house tech support, and the guys we had on contract were utterly useless. 

After a couple of days, I get a call from my agency contact who says he's got a couple of jobs I would be perfect for - both IT technician work in schools. ""Sure!"" I thought, after all, I'm going into a new field, so it would be good to be in an environment I'm familiar with and I have lots of ideas on how teachers can use tech to do what they do better. 

Long story short, I ended back at the first school I was placed at on teacher training, which was really, really useful as I knew the site, knew the guy who I was going to be working with, and knew the IT teachers and a good number of the kids (and I left that place on a real high note, I was gutted to have left!).

So a month or so passes and I get a call from the library, where there is a trolley full of iPads used for various things. Turns out, one of the screens has a pinkish, purplish tinge to it and no one could figure out why. No settings were changed but it clearly looked like a hardware issue. I took it back across the site to our office and began to poke and pry, rummaging around the internals to see if there was a loose connection somewhere. Nothing would work. 

Having had a particularly long week, I had a 'moment' and ended up dropping the thing. Face. First. 

'Oh, crap.' was the thought that ran through my head. 

Gingerly, I picked it up and turned it over. With my previous 'experience' of Apple products, I thought it was a death sentence for that week's pay, but no! The screen was physically as good as it was before on first inspection. 

'Ok, it's not completely borked I don't think, have I killed the internals?'

And I turn it on. 

And I am pleasantly surprised when the whole screen is displaying correctly in a plethora of kaleidoscopic colour and wonder, with none of the issues initially reported! I keep it in the office for an hour or so, checking it's all working, running updates, general use and so on and everything is absolutely fine! So we chalked it up as a 'potential' fix - drop it from maybe a foot, face first, onto the carpeted floor. 

A week later, we get another call. For the same problem, on a different tablet. ""Not a problem, I'll be right down and it'll be working again in 5 minutes."" and off I toddle to the library. It's a class full of (now) year 10 pupils, many of which I'd taught previously and after the usual banter I had going with all of them, asking how they were doing, etc. I crack on with the issue. I get handed the tablet and the class is all looking at me. You know the look. Expectant, anticipating, curious, judging.

I look up with a wry smile on my face. ""Don't do this yourself guys, I'm a *professional*"".

t3_cqkh43,"What data types don't match, all hell breaks loose","Here is another recollection from long ago:

I was a lead developer/project manager for a software company and my baby was the insurance system we sold.

We had implemented the insurance system for a large agribusiness company here is Adelaide; this was around 1988/89.

They were an IBM AS/400 shop, but had a VAX/VMS system driving a Teletext server and our insurance system was also deployed on VAX/VMS systems.

They used their Teletext development team to build an interface between our system and their AS/400 general ledger (accounting) system; I think as they had VAX/VMS experience.

Their CIO was a very high powered hard hitting lady, not a Karen; BTW we became good friends over the years.

So the interface was deployed and then the proverbial hits the fan.  It does not balance, i.e. the reports from the insurance system did not match what ended up in the general ledger system.

So a meeting was called with all the appropriate players, including the customer CIO, my CEO, and team members from both sides.  About 10 people in the meeting, manager heavy.  I am sure our system is solid, as is our side of the interface.

So the meeting starts, all the normal formalities, coffee etc.

We get to the core issue right up front.  Everyone says their bit and it seems to be an impasse for a while.

I suddenly realise something, the Teletext system is written in Fortran, and our insurance system in Cobol.

So I ask the obvious two questions, A. What language did you use for the interface? and B. What data type for the money fields?

Answers: A. Fortran B. Floating Point (double)

Ka-ching!  I looked over at the customer CIO, she looked a little sheepish, I smiled and she smiled back.

Cobol uses fixed point for most data, especially money, and thus avoids the normal floating rounding errors.  Problem solved.

I guess people who don't work with financial IT systems don't always realise floating point is bad news.

t3_cqegq7,Ultra Rude Clients!,"This is a story from a couple of years ago when I used to provide IT support to medium sized businesses. Part of my job was to setup new workstations and make sure they are connected to the network and that the phones were working and that everything works basically.

One day a new client put an order through for 20 laptops with docking stations, mice and keyboards and 40 monitors. But when we arrived to set them up...

Me: The one and only ;-) |SM: Section manager (On the side of the client)| SP: Section Supervisor (On the side of the client) | R: Recepcionist | MM: My manager

*We arrived at the client early in the morning at 7am, all the desks were meant to be cleared of personal belongings and staff were meant to back up data on to a dedicated network share. The department manager sent an email copying my team in and all 20 staff members with the date and time we were ariving. We booked a parking space for our van two weeks prior to our visit. The parking space was right next to the enterance.*

*We arrived at the company and couldn't find the parking bay that we requested. Whilst my collegue waited in the car I went to ask recepcion...*

Me: Hi we're here from Company Name and were here to see SM, we booked this parking space but can't seem to find it.

R: Ok, let me have a look........................I can't find you on my system for this bay

Me: That's strange, here's the email confirmation

R: O, No, that can't be right this space is for vans only

Me: But we are a van, we are delivering and setting up loads of IT equipment for SM

R: O, No that parking space is not for IT it's for important things like the shop and the cafe on the first floor

Me: Excuse me? Look, I don't mean to be rude but we're here to do a job.

R: Allow me to call SM

*Put's the phone down*

R: It turns out that we do have a parking place for you but it was moved to this space. SM is on her way down to meet you

Me: Great thanks! I will just tell my collegue the parking number

SM: Hi Welcome to company name, Do you have many things to carry?

Me: Hi, yes we got all the requested monitors, laptops, docks, mice and keyboards you ordered as well as the cabling.

*SM directs me to the stairs*

SM: Right we're based on the 19th floor

Me: Blimey! Where are your lifts?

SM: Visitor lifts open at 9am

Me: Pardon? Do you have staff lifts?

SM: Yes but you're not staff and were not insured to carry visitors in those lifts.

Me: We are not walking up all those stairs!

SM: hmmm, ok let me ask security, Ok you're allowed to use the lifts follow me

Me: Thank god!

*We got up to the 19th Floor and were shown the desks, none of which were cleaned, they were extremely dirty with rotten left over food and it stank. None of the staff members backed up their data either. SP met us by the lift*

SM: Right this is SP, she will be taking care of you today.

Me: Hi Nice to meet you!

SP: A yes very good, Follow me, this is the desks you will be clearing, there's some rubish bags in the cupbord just here. Make sure you split the rubish up for recycling. All the old computers are to be loaded into my van at this parking space. All staff members have left me their log in details on this pice of paper for you to transfer the data. *(Looks in bag for pice of paper)* O dear me, I must of left it in the cafe on the table, let me just go down and get it.

*Guess what parking space it was (THE ONE WE BOOKED)*

Me: You made your staff right down their log in details on the pice of paper and left it on the table in the cafe? These people must change their passwords now! That's extremely dangerous, especially since you left it unatended. You Don't ask people to right down their log in details!

SP: DON'T BE SO RUDE!

Me: Excuse me? We are an IT company we were promised that all this will be done before we got here!

Whilst SP went down to get the log in details, *I decided to take some photos and send them to my manager. I then gave him a call...*

Me: Hi, were at this company name job *I explained what has happened*

MM: You are joking me right? I just seen the photos you sent, no I'm not having two of my workers putting their health and safety at risk. Go back to base and explain that you can't do the job due to health and safety reasons and tell SM to check her emails. Explain that we still have to charge the call out fee

*When SP got backed we asked to speak to SM*

SP: What You Think you're doing standing around chatting! Get to work NOW!

Me: Can I speak to SM please

SP: Not until you finish your work

Me: It's important

SP: Ok, Ok, I'll get her down for you

Me: I'm sorry but after seeing the circumstances, my manager has canceled this appointment to a time when you're prepaired. He asked me to tell you to check your email and that he is still charging you for the call out.

SM: THAT IS REDICOLOUS! WE EVEN PAID FOR THE BIN BAGS FOR YOU TO TAKE THE RUBISH OUT! IS THAT COST BEING REFUNDED? TRUST ME YOU TWO WILL BE OUT OF A JOB TODAY AND I WILL MAKE SURE YOU NEVER GET ANOTHER JOB EVER AGAIN IF YOU DON'T FINISH THIS NOW! YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA CALL THIS STUPID \*\*\*\* OF A MANAGER AND HE WILL TO LOSE HIS JOB TOO! I WILL TAKE YOUR COMPANY DOWN YOU WAIT FOR TOMORROWS NEWS PAPERS.

*We got escorted out by security.*

We went back to base to witness an argument over the phone. It turned out that SM had a massive go at my manager over the phone and he terminated the IT Support Contract.

Two days later we were called to a meeting with SM's lawyer but after my manager showed the photos as well as the conversation he recorded. The lawyer phoned up the client to say that he dosen't deal with clients like that and left the case. - Must have not been paid!

Two weeks later and curtesy of my manager, the client has undergone a health and safety inspection which it failed, but the company was never given the chance to improve as two Months it went bust

t3_cqenj5,Parents provide best example of PEBKAC,"So, here's a little story for y'all. Not much tech support per se, but the best description of a PEBKAC I've seen.

The cast;

Me: Dental Student, home for summer break, general gaming and pc nerd, I know enough to not break my pc

Dad: 40 year old architect. Arguably tech-savvy

The scenario;

Parents recently (ie a few months ago) bought a Smart TV with Netflix and have been using the shit out of it alongside my little sister on summer break, nothing untoward, works as advertised, Dad finds internet speed on TV to be around 80Mb/s wired. I come home and a few days later the internet speed has hit the floor; it's lucky to hit above 0.5Mb/s.

\*OhShit.jpg\*

Guess who gets the blame.

\&gt;Dad: Elkubik get down here right now! What have you done with the internet! Have you been messing with the router!?

\&gt;Me: No. (I mean, sure I game and watch YT and stuff upstairs but that \*really\* shouldn't)

\&gt;D: Well fix this!

\&gt;Me: Have you tried turning it off and on again?

\&gt;D: Yes! Jesus!

Ok then. Let's have a looksee. Router looks like it's working. Fire up speedtest first on my phone as it's on hand. 50Mb/s. Fine, acceptable. Go over to the only other wired PC in the house (everyone else is on laptops, and the computer is the one my dad \*borrowed\* after his previous died and I went to Uni, really quite a coincidence if you ask me), in the office. Fire up speedtest on there, 70Mb/s. Everything works perfectly fine.

Go back to my parents restarting the router (because it's clearly the router's fault seeing as every other device ~~can't connect~~ connects just fine). Sit there for a few minutes as the ~~annoying little piece of shit~~ router finally decides to return to the world of the living.

Queue 10 minutes of attempting to connect the TV to the router. Can't find the wired network, fails to connect to any WiFi network that it could connect to. Notice while browsing through settings that it's on Android. Remember that my own Android phone tends to derp out every couple of months and refuse to speak to any other device. On/Off fixes this.

\&gt;Me: You are \*certain\* you turned it off and on again?

\&gt;D: Yeah. Look. *Presses power button.*

Screen turns off instantly, no ""power off"" or anything.  Instant red flags.

\&gt;Me: You're sure that isn't sleep?

\&gt;D: No way, look, all the lights are off!

\*facepalm.png\*

So I take the remote and ""turn the TV back on"". Lo and behold it's still displaying the settings menu, with no boot or anything. Long press of the power button on the remote gets me a ""powering off"" notification, and the TV actually, finally, powers off. For the first time in months. What a surprise when, upon powering back on, we get a nicely animated splash screen and a long wait (ok I exaggerate, maybe like 2 minutes) until we're greeted with the main screen of the TV. Go into settings, reconnect to WiFi first, takes me a good minute (of which most was typing in the password with the stupid ABC keyboard layout that every TV and console maker seems to love). Wired took the best part of 10 seconds. Netflix's own diagnostic gives us a speed of 70Mb/s.

And that's how my parents discovered that the TV can be turned \*off\* and I discovered not to trust the user to be able to perform even the simplest of tasks.

t3_cq0zcj,Where do you want this network rack?,"The company I work for is currently remodeling the first floor of the building. They are turning into a show piece to bring customers in and show off and WOW! people. I'm part of the design approval team because I'm in IT and the company FINALLY figured out we need to be part of the process (after 4 other remodels in various locations).

I got the newest revision of the plans today and notice AGAIN that they didn't include a space for networking equipment so I went across the street to the architurkey firm designing the place. I asked to speak to the architect and inquired about a centralized networking spot and he said ""we decided it won't be needed and left it out"". I stood there for a moment and then picked up my jaw off the floor and asked (in a more diplomatic term) WTF?!?!? He tried to explain that it wasn't going to be too bad we that we just needed to figure something out. I looked at the plans and there are 43 (not a typo) displays (tv with no sound) and 96 network drops. I asked about the wiring and he said ""it won't be a problem"". After some more back and forth I walked away.

Fast forward a few hours and I got my two wheeler (aka the dolly) and wheeled a full sized rack across the street and up to the architurkeys office and asked where they wanted it. Dude came out and asked what I was doing. I said ""I need a space for the equipment that is going to run the network and the displays so this is the first of 4 racks I'm bring over to hook everything up when the time comes. He starts spluttering that it can't be done like this and I say ""well sir, I've got a fiber line that runs under the street so I CAN run it over for everything"" (I know...we'd need more equipment...but he didn't lol) and I ""figured out"" where I'm going to hook everything up...HERE

He decided that maaayyybbeee we DID actually need a space and they would draw it in.

t3_cq6s8y,Throw it against the wall!,"This story is from 2006. Ever since I got handy with computers I helped my dad with the computers at his company office. He had 2 old flat case systems with the screens on top of them. 

One day I came from school and went by my dad's office. As soon as I walk in he starts asking me to check out one of the systems because it wouldn't start, the screen stayed black. I could tell he was very agitated and I wasn't having a good day either. As I just walked in I wanted to have a drink first but my dad wouldn't have it and kept pushing me to check the computer.

I resumed getting myself a drink and sat down at the canteen table. He kept asking and finally I said: ""Just throw it against the wall and see if that helps."" Guess what? He did. He grabbed the case from under the screen unplugging everything in the progress and walked outside. He then just threw it against the wall outside and walked away.

I was flabbergasted. The case was broken and it seemed lost. I plugged it back in to see what would happen. I pressed the power button and the screen turned on...

But then, before I hung up, I remembered something. My laptop would lose wifi connection at random times, also.  After a bit of searching (I probably had to google it), I finally realized that there was a little toggle button on the front of the laptop (accessible even when the laptop was closed). That button could turn on/off the wifi (why?!). Additionally, that button could be unknowingly toggled when I would lean forward and brush it my body (terrible design!).

t3_cq0p45,11:00am. Time for the network to fail for users in 2W.,"Our group was level two support (deskside) at huge mega international company, manufacturing plants 6A/B. Millions of square feet of production space - large enough for trains to roll through the factory itself, load and unload materials and products and happily chug their way off to other facilities around the country.

People in our group consisted of a displaced full-time worker who used to do something else before being shunted to our support group to run out his retirement clock, several contracted employees who were hired by staffing firms who filled 3rd party contracts to fill catalog numbers in the HR catalog (seriously, see epilogue to the post below), and a newly ordained real employee manager, level 1 (the lowest possible managerial classification there was) to oversee us all.

There was an internal call center for level 1 support in the basement of a building at the global HQ building several miles away. Anything they didn't get would be sent to us for on-site support.

One day, shortly after 11am there was a sudden burst of calls routed our way from the users in the Second Floor, West section. A few dozen engineers reported that networking services had slowed to a crawl, and they were being dropped. Not terribly uncommon, our site was using Token Ring, and users would frequently kick a cable loose, or the token would fall out of the cable and roll under the desk, and a bad termination to any one computer in the circuit would cause problems for all.

After an hour or so of unplugging and replugging the cables under all of the desks, making sure Windows 95 had the correct drivers and all of the settings were correct, the network seemed to be back to normal.

Next day, shortly after 11am, same group of people called and reported the same network problems. I checked the last computer that I had checked the day before on the assumption that since the issues went away when I checked that computer it was the most likely culprit and was due for a new NIC, not a rare occurrence. But the problem persisted.

So the case went to G, a network engineer who had his own cubicle a few prairie dog holes down from me and did nothing but make sure that the several hundred PCs on site would network, the very expensive fiber connections between the switches and closets would fiber, traced bad wiring and other network only things. G didn't talk to any end user for any reason. Every issue with the network came to his attention through us. His troubleshooting included using a packet sniffer and identified the problem as being in the special cube.

The special cube was occupied by a manager, level 5. He was the highest ranking person at the site who didn't have an actual office with an actual door, but was special enough to merit cubicle walls that were about 6' high, as opposed to the 4' walls typical for everybody else. His cube was larger, with room for his desk and three visitor chairs across from him. Nobody was quite sure what he did, but he did it with power and authority.

He would come into the office around 10 or 10:30am, read some emails, then launch this brand new program he had discovered on the internet - his authority granted him unlimited browsing through the firewall - and when we showed up he was anxious to show us the amazing awesomeness of PointCast. No more having to go to web pages to look up sports scores and headline news like a sucker! PointCast would stream the fresh, new and recent updates to his computer without lifting a finger! He would run the software for an hour or two, then shut down his computer and leave the building for some very important meetings.

We explained to him that company policy prohibited the installation of any software that was not on a very short list of approved packages. He initially allowed us to uninstall it, but a few days later it was back, in all of its network saturation glory.

Nobody in our group, nor at least three levels up in IT support outranked him so we couldn't force him to comply. The people being kicked off the network were almost entirely engineers who reported to him through one or two intermediate layers so he could dismiss their issues with a wave of his hand, and they were happy to slack off for a bit during the day - or at least work on the software they could use without needing the network.

Eventually came the solution: after about six weeks of this he loudly declared that PointCast was boring, he was tired of the constant crawl of text that never told him anything interesting - occasionally crashing in the process - and summoned a level two to his cubicle (he didn't have to call the level 1 call center) to scrub the buggy program from his machine. Before 1:00pm because he had a very important meeting offsite.

And just like that the networking issues vanished.

Epilogue: catalog numbers.

The way humungo corp did hiring involved an HR catalog. When somebody was needed to fill a position a manager would consult the list and submit a requisition order for, say, ""deskside support, full time - P/N 4001992"" and HR would carry out the steps needed to make it happen. Needed a new engineer, secretary, metallurgy tech, you find the part number and submit the purchase request. Needed a new coffeemaker, fleet vehicle big screen TV to mount over a loading bay? Exactly the same process, to the company it was just another part from just another catalog. It felt like of weird to be itemized like that.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cpscah,Smoke in the koi pond,"In ages past I found myself as a priestly mage of support, second order. I resided in a cathedral of labor, present to alleviate the pains of technology from the laborers there. One vestibule of my realm was utilized by not the typical engineers who infested the land, but a bevy of receptionists, purchasers, pushers of paper, and others of the clan administrative. They occupied the second floor East, in an area surrounded on three sides with ample glass windows. Contrasting to the rambunctious silly nature of the clan engineer, these docile workers were peaceful, quiet, calm - rarely a sound beyond a softly ringing phone, muted yet brief conversations, and the gentle tap of the keys.

In short, it was a veritable koi pond, worthy of a zen destination for meditation.

As a priest of the second order I had but rare occasion to visit the oasis of peace. In the bowels of the white archcathedral of capitalism resided a cave of toil, where the lay clergy of the first order would answer the phones a-ringing to identify issues and attempt to purge the souls of the minorly inconvenienced. For all imperfections unresolvable by the first order, a ticket of routing would be dispatched to the 2nd order, some 30 miles distant, for the personal and hands-on resolution they and only they could provide.

The first order was quite occupied in their tasks, with hold times occasionally reaching some 15-20 minutes before they could speak to the troubled spirit, as what happened the day that a resident of the koi pond vocalized on the line.

&gt; I was laboring in my document of excel, a pop was heard, the screen went dark and the smoke from within the computer has been released. How can I recover my document?

To which replied the acolyte:

&gt; Lamentations, it sounds as if your computer has suffered damages physical. I shall dispatch a priest of the second order forthwith. Did you unplug your computer when the smoke did start to billow about your feet?

To which she replied:

&gt; I did not, for I have been repeatedly instructed to never simply turn off a computer without a prior click of button of start, then shutdown. When my image of computing vanished from the pane of visions I could no longer see the button of start to select the shutdown prayer and have therefore been waiting these 15 minutes to receive your guidance.

The priests of the second order were sent a urgent page of utmost priority to investigate, where they found a fried power supply, a lovely odor of burned electronics and wiring, a very passive and calm user, and a few dozen other cubicles filled with people who were not reacting to the events unfolding.",talesfromtechsupport

So this was back in the 1980's. The agency was transitioning from IBM Selectric typewriters to these new fangled IBM mainframes with monitors. One of the older ladies who had worked there for a long time  (let's call her Susan) and would type out checks every month, somewhere in the range of 150-250 checks every month. Now, when trying to correct an error on a type writer, there is no backspace. You have to go in with whiteout the wrong area. Quick cover up, blow on it to dry it, you're all fixed. She got really good at quickly correcting her errors.

In come these new fancy computer monitors on which Susan is to input her checks on. Rachel looks over one day to see Susan correcting one of her mistakes, by applying whiteout to the computer monitor screen and then blowing on it to dry it. Rachel had to come over and help get the white out off and show her how to actually delete errors (little spit and a napkin. CRT screens were thick and tough).  They had a good laugh about it.

TL;DR older employee who is used to fixing typewriter errors tries to fix a computer error by applying whiteout on the screen",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cpyxid,The Re-burning,"This happened way back in 2012. English is not my primary language so apologies in advance.

I was working in an advertising company as a ""swiss knife"" which basically means the guy who fixes everything computer related. We we organizing a big event, and we were going to give a press kit. A nice folder, some A4 papers with a press release, and a CD containing a pdf presentation. 1000 copies.

Paper stuff was some other guys responsibility, so I got the pdf, went to a cd duplication store, they duplicated 1000 copies, with that organization's branding on them. also had some extra copies were made to be show to the client. Everything was ready the day before that event.

At night, around 21:00, my phone rings, my boss calls me

\- Hi, so the organization manager wants to change the filename on the CD's, its ""brand\_presentation.pdf"" he didnt like the underscore lets make it ""brand SPACE presentation.pdf""

\* excuse me what? are you serious, CDs are already burned, its 21:00, the event starts at 10:00 tomorrow, how am I supposed to to this?

\- make it happen I dont care how.

I called the CD burning shop, closed obviously

quick thinking. we have 10 iMacs at the office. I have my work macbook, another macbook at home, let's bring it to the office. pdf is small in size, this operation may be possible.

I called 2 of my coworkers, ""I will get you food and beer please come to the office and help me"" they said ok.

I drive to the office.

I like to backup things. By total chance, the week before I ordered 2000 empty unbranded CDs and 2000 empty CD stickers to the office.

So here we are, 12 Macs, 3 guys, 1000 empty CDs, 1000 empty CD stickers, food, beer, and a stupid pdf with some space in the filename. We started burning the CDs.

It was like a ford car assembly line, I put empty CD to one computer, move to the next one, as I put the 12th cd into 12th computer the first one is finished so while I was feeding the machines with CDs, one guy ""handwrites"" the organization name on the stickers with a nice calligraphy and the other one puts stickers on CD.

We started around midnight and finished around 8 AM.

zero sleep, I drive to the venue, drop the CDs to the press desk, started putting them into press release folder, and here comes ""that"" manager.

he asks me ""why these CD are not branded with actual graphics, why are these handwritten?""

""OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD""

t3_cpt89o,I'm Mr. Bigshot and I Approve this Downtime,"I support an application across seven different locations.  It's not critical for business, but when it goes down, it makes people hyperventilate because they don't remember how to do the same function the old fashioned way. Thankfully, downtimes for this application are a rare event.

Yesterday we had one of those rare unplanned downtimes.  It's not my first rodeo, so I pull out my downtime procedures and start going down the list.  One of the things I have to do is notify the users and the only way to do that is to send an email through the administrative departments of all seven sites.  Five of the sites were perfectly fine with this and sent the message out to their people with no trouble.  Then we get to the other two sites.  I sent the message to administration, only to get a reply from the person I sent it to asking if the head of their department, we'll call him Mr. Bigshot, had approved the email and if so, to forward his approval email because they don't send ANYTHING without Mr. Bigshot's approval.  

Small problem with that:

1.  Mr. Bigshot is notoriously hard to get in touch with.  I can send him an email with a question or a request for more information so I can fulfill a request of his and he won't respond until I resend it two or three times and copy my boss and my boss's boss on the messages, if then.
2. Mr. Bigshot is currently out of town until next week.  
3. This wasn't some pointless message.  The system was down and the end users needed to know to use their downtime procedures.  

I responded back with points #2 and 3 and copied my boss (she knows what a PITA these two locations are and what a PITA Mr. Bigshot is).  I never got a response from the administration department, so I'm not sure if the end users ever received the message or not.  Fortunately, the downtime was resolved about an hour after I sent the message out, so there likely wasn't enough time to cause mass panic. I think once Mr. Bigshot gets back into town next week, I'll ask my boss to get in touch with him and ask for a blanket approval on anything I send so that I can avoid this. 

If I'm lucky, I might get a response by Christmas.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cpswrx,The network switch at the roof.,"This happened way back in 2008. English is not my primary language so apologies in advance.  


I was at mandatory military service as an ordinary private, but my ""talent"" in understanding computer related stuff got me some desk job, and ""me the military soldier"" quickly turned out to ""me the tech support service soldier"" in service of the ranked officers. I was actually doing computer and other technical maintenance stuff at the base, until that one day I had the most extreme tech support I ever gave.  


It was around 23:00 and I was in bed ready to sleep, idk reading, maybe? I got called to the hq by one of ranked officers. I got told to dress civil clothing. ""at this hour? ok"" I said and went. There was this high ranked officer in his personal car, ""get in"" he said, ""I have no internet at home"" wow.  


So we drove like 20 minutes to his flat, in a 2-building complex, each got 12 floors (important) his was 5th floor.   


We got into his house, he showed me his computer, no ethernet connection. ""show me the modem"" I said thinking this should be easy, bad or disconnected cable.  


He pointed that one other building, 7th floor.  


""- what?""   
""\* there it is""  
""- ..... how.... why""  
""\* that guy pays and we share""  
""- oh you mean both of you""  
""\* no we as two building""  


So, yes. ""That guy"" pays for a 8Mbit ADSL connection and shares the connection to 2 entire, 12 floored building.  


I asked ""how did you connect""  
he said ""there is a cable on the roof""  


Naturally I said, ""lets check the other guys modem cause there is no way I'm going to the roof"", forgetting that I'm a soldier and technically I'm under order so the officer told me I should check the roof first and thats an order.   


So we went up 12th floor, only to find the trap door locked with a huge padlock. The officer said the guy who has the key is on vacation, I thought ""ok great this adventure is over"" but noooo, he phoned ""his foot soldier"" to find a cutter and and bust the padlock with a cutter. please keep in mind that its about midnight now. after 20 something minutes, the padlock is cut and roof door opens.  


I went up the the roof, found the ethernet cable which comes from the other bulding, followed it, and reached to...  


a network switch, covered in pidgeon poo, its cover plastic melted, and obviously not working.  


I took the switch from the poo pile, got down the ladder, showed him ""this is the problem"".   


and the officer called some guy again. its probably 01:00 am now. give the phone to me, and I ""ordered"" a switch at this hour.   


and yes, it was delivered by car.  


and yes, I installed it, got the internet working, and his ""foot soldier"" drove me back to base.

t3_cpdpim,"I know this is his extension, get him on the phone now!","Quick one for you all today. One of my developers got a new desk phone extension like a month ago. We expect to get a couple of calls a week from people asking for help or explanations regarding our applications. Since the new extension went in he's been getting calls 3 or 4 times a day for the person who previously had it. Without further explanation, the funniest exchange thus far:

Caller: ""Hi I'm calling for Such-and-such Johnson, I need to speak with him, it's urgent.""

Dev: ""Sorry, but this is a new extension for me, you should check the directory or get the operator to connect you to his extension.""

Caller: ""That's fine, just get him on the phone.""

Dev: ""Excuse me?""

Caller: ""Look, I know his extension, I know hes there, get him on the phone.""

\*Dev looks at me completely confused, then hands me the phone\*

Me: ""This is Dev's manager, is there something you need from Dev?""

Caller: ""I know this is is Such-and-such Johnson's phone, I don't give a fuck who you are, get him on the phone right now or I'll make sure you don't have a job in the morning.""

Me: ""Oh, Such-and-such... yeah he hasn't worked here in 2 months since he got caught stealing laptops...""

Caller immediately hangs up. I dialed the number back, got a not-valid response... I wish we had those phones recorded, cause I'm 99% sure that was one of the dudes he was selling equipment to.

t3_cpo9x3,"A pair of tales, one of customer service, one of technical weirdness","The following happened a couple of years ago while I was working for a customer-facing, remote support outfit that did the occasional in-home visit. This was an interesting thing that happened towards the end of my time with the said company its less of a tech issue and more of a customer service issue but I figured I would share. The second bonus story below that is more of a tech issue

So for your reference, the company has several levels of tech support. Also, none of the names are the real names.

L1: Essentially a trained monkey performing triage, they are as likely to make a problem worse as they are to make it better.

L2: These guys do more advanced troubleshooting, generally safe hands, they know enough to be dangerous.

L3: The nutjobs that can figure out the weird shit, lots of experience, lots of tribal knowledge, essentially a walking knowledge base.

L4: A developer, the eldritch beings with knowledge beyond that of mere mortals like myself, to disturb one was as likely to get you eaten (read fired) as it was to solve your problem.

OL1: Essentially an L1 that we would send onsite to a clients home to do something stupidly simple. Now the company has 1 or 2 people for this job in a given area, and typically another 4 or so who can be paid on a job by job basis.

OL2: Essentially an L2 agent that would go onsite and then contact an L2 or L3 acting as their eyes and ears. Expensive service.

Technically we also offered OL3, but it was far to expensive for most people to afford, and we also offered OL4 on a technicality, but only an L4 can schedule an OL4 (Typically themselves).

At the said company I was an L3, I started off as an overqualified L1 and then worked as an L2 for a year before being promoted to the level of my incompetence L3.

The customer service

So there I am watching a batch of L1's who are trying not to have a nervous breakdown as they prove they can be L2's. My job essentially is to step in if someone fucks up horribly, otherwise, its to provide technical tips that would normally require digging through the companies terrible knowledge base.

Where I am sitting I can keep tabs on things, and one of my L1's (Suzy) starts to frantically wave her hand to get my attention. I open the call at my desk and start pulling up the client (Betty's) history. It is extensive, most of our clients the case history loads instantly, for Betty it took a good 30 seconds to load. This is why Suzy is frantically waving her hand. Betty is on the phone is being patient, simply just trying to schedule someone out to her home to set up or fix her printer(she isn't certain what is wrong). Except she is also requesting that a specific person (let us call him David, which isn't his real name) not be sent out to her home, as he has been involved all her recent onsite visits and has never actually completed a job to her satisfaction.

So i get up and visit my l1, who is very frustrated because all the ol1's in her our are scheduled and none of our contractors are taking jobs at the moment. So the only ol2 in the area is fucking David. Now having worked with david many times i can tell you david is a piece of work. The issue isn't that he is incompetent, it is that he is both lazy and dishonest.

So I take over at this point and let her know that the only option is David unless she wants to wait three weeks or call in every day to try and get one of our contractors. She decides to call in every day because she really hates David.

So we leave the ticket open and David sees this open ticket in his area and reschedules it (not unheard of). I call Betty and cancel the appointment explaining that David had scheduled himself. This happens the next two days in a row so i cancel it and add a note that David isn't to touch this appointment. David sees this and closes the ticket only to reopen a new identical one it but he redoes the onsite service from an OL2, to an OL4 and has assigned it to himself. Essentially making the price jump from about 40(for the service), to 500 (per hour with a two-hour minimum).  I see this the next day that she calls in and is rather upset because David had shown up at her home to try to do the job.

I quickly run the situation by my boss (Ken), who quickly runs it by our sites L4 (Fred). Now Fred is a nice guy, but his time is expensive hence why no one bothers him. So Fred gets a wicked smile and has me call up David.

I get David on the phone and Essentially tell him to go to his car and wait. We get on the phone with Betty and let her know that we are making an exception and sending

Fred, myself, Ken and Suzy all drive 30 minutes to Betty's house and while the Fred and I are essentially redoing the last six months of work that she has had asked to be done (because of david). Meanwhile, Suzy is driving David and my boss back in the company car that David was driving.Fred and I carefully go through each and every job that David was supposed to do and ensure that they are all done correctly, it takes a couple of hours but we get betty sorted and let her know there will be no charge for the visit.

We get back to the office and David has been let go for essentially doing jobs to the ""good enough"" point and then calling it a day.

Bonus story an actual technical issue.

This was when I was working as an L2 for the aforementioned tech company.

Client calls in and is trying to get wifi working on his computer. This is a new client who was referred to us by a neighbor of his. One of our L1's talked to him on the phone and what essentially had happened was he was getting broadband internet for the first time. Now his new ISP had provided him with a wireless router/modem combo. So he calls us because he wants to use it wirelessly because the ISP dude told him he could. The L1 hops on our sales portal and takes payment and before he knows it he is the proud new owner of a USB wireless card.So the client calls in because he has the wireless card and needs help setting it up. So we try to walk him through hooking up the wireless card but he is being a crotchety old man and uncooperative. So we schedule an L1 to go out, L1 gets there and immediately calls for help and that is where I become involved. Our L1 cant find the USB port on the computer, we talk on the phone I try to walk them through numerous things to try and nothing. So we start talking and discover its an older computer and that we cant use the ethernet port on it because it was damaged when someone successfully plugged a USB wireless card into it. L1 and I continue to troubleshoot when they mention how slow the old computer is, and I casually ask ""well what version of windows is it?"" thinking maybe its running vista and needs a bit of memory.  So we poke around a bit and the menus they are describing sound wrong to me, the options aren't lining up with any version of windows that I am used to, so I ask ""hey it isn't a mac is it?""  It was not a mac.We eventually determined that the machine has no USB ports, as it not only predates wifi, it predates the USB port and was running windows 3.1.

TLDRStory 1: Incompetent onsite tech incurs the wrath of a nutjob and an eldritch entity, and gets fired for his trouble.Story 2: Museum pieces are not future proof.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_cpamti,Storys from Grandma,"First things first: I'm on mobile and English is not my first language.

Most important: My grandma is not to blame for anything.



The setting. 

My grandparents are living in the apartment below mine. 
They grew up in a strongly rural environment and never got used to electronics in any form.
With time, they learned how to use a TV remote and a cordless telephone, but they just know, how to do the stuff they need: turning it on, changing channels, calling someone and accepting incoming calls. Nothing more. 



Story one: Rechargeable?? 

After a long day at work I entered the staircase of our home. I haven't even yet closed the front door, as my grandma stuck her head out of her apartment.

GM: Hey ME, my phone is not working.

Me: what's the problem?

GM: It does recharge, but turns off, after a few minutes.

Me: How old are the rechargeable? (let's go with this, for rechargeable battery packs. You'll see why)

GM: Grandpa changed them two days ago.

That was the moment my inner alarm bell started ringing.
My grandpa had a little business of changing batterys in neighbors and family's watches. And also held a stock of batteries. Non-rechargeable-batteries...


I took the (slightly to warm) phone off its loading station and opened the back, just to find a pair of batteries.

I took them out, told my grandma to put the old rechargeables back in, while I order a new pair for her.



Story two: sticky situation

I was sitting in the living room of my grandparents, chatting about the day, when suddenly the TV turned off.

Me: what was that?

GM: oh. That happens a lot. Sometimes the TV does strange things, or doesn't do anything when pushing buttons on the remote.

Well, at least one useful info. The remote is having a problem.

I took it of the coffee table and instantly noticed how sticky it was.

Me: what happened to your remote?

GM: Nothing

I gave her the ""we both know that that's a lie"" look.

GM: a glass of juice fell over...

I took the remote, removed the already corroding batteries and pried open the chassis.
The PCB got its part of the juice and also had begun to corrode.

Me: it is dead, Jim.

GM: who is Jim?





Story three: Ghost calls

After a long day at work I enter the house and got cached by Grandma.

GM: someone called me.

Me: Who?

GM: I don't know. It was at midnight. But my phone sounded different.

Me: okay, let me get my notebook and I'll have a look.

Ten minutes later I was sitting at the kitchen table, my notebook in front of me, logging into the isp provided home router.
I checked the phone history, but didn't find any calls that night.

Logged out and closed the imaginary ticket.

Wouldn't been the first time, she heard ghosts.


Next day, same scene.
My Grandma told me that at midnight her phone was ringing and sounded different.
Out of curiosity I offered to take her phone with me, to check who is calling at midnight.

The moment I held the phone in my hand, I saw the problem.
In the left lower corner of the display was a little picture af a little alarm clock.

Somehow my grandma managed to activate the alarm with its default time of 12 o'clock midnight.
I deactivated the alarm and called it a day.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cpdfxb,You're not as popular as you may think.,"A quick story to pop my TFTS cherry. This happened a few months back when I worked for a semi truck dealer supporting 9 shops across 2 states. Work ranged from typical help desk support to driving out to different shops to do network installs. 

$user is a 70-80 year old parts specialist, only computer literate enough to do his job.

$user stops by the IT office to complain that he hasn't received email all afternoon. Typically back parts specialists receive emails from technicians requesting parts that they bring to the counter for the tech to grab and install in the truck they are working on, which happens pretty frequently all day. He's irate and is bitching about how he needs to get parts out to the techs and he can't do his job because the email is down.

Strange since I haven't heard anyone else in the company (200+ people) complain about the email being down. I've been emailing people all day. Maybe his Outlook client is acting up? $user is known for clicking anything and everything on his screen breaking things that I didn't even know could be broken. I walk with $user to the parts counter to see what the problem is. 

I see nothing out of the ordinary, internet us up and Outlook is connected and online. He hasn't received an email since about 12:30 P.M. which is weird since it was about 3:00 P.M. and usually the parts counter is pretty busy. 

I run back to the IT office and quick send him an email to see if he gets it or if I get some sort of message. I go back to the parts counter and see that his Outlook received the email. I then tell the other parts worker to send $user an email. A few seconds after the other worker sends an email and it goes through on $user's PC. 

$user hasn't received emails all afternoon because nobody sent him anything. 

&gt;$user: Ohoho well thanks for the help! Guess I'll be patient next time! (No apology for being a dick 2 minutes beforehand)

&gt;$me: Haha yep no problem let me know if you have more issues (please don't)

I head back to the office and debate if IT is really what I want to be doing for the next 40 years of my painful existence. Still in the field so it hasn't broken me yet.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cp48tx,My dog knows when the phone will ring.,"Not my story, this one was from my uncle.

He works for a telecommunications company, an old one  that is seldom seen anymore. 

Back when the phones in your home were owned by the telecom a lady was having an issue where many phone calls were not coming in. The phone would not ring, BUT when the phone did ring the dog would howl first.

A lineman (technician using modern terms) was sent out to investigate. He arrived and checked the wiring.  That looked ok. He pulls out his field phone and dials the house phone. No, ringing... Then the dog howls and the house phone rings.

He goes around and finds the dog. The dog was chained to the grounding stake. The groundingb stake was no in the ground far enough AND the earth was a bit dry. 

See where this is going?

The dog would was sometimes getting shocked and would then urinate completing the circuit. This was uncomfortable to the dog and it would howl, BUT the phone would ring.

He never told me how it got remedied, just what the tech had found.

.....

If this is folk lore,  I apologize, this was the story as best as I remember being told to me by my uncle  back in the mid to late 90's.

I have personally been subjected to various voltages,  line power (120v ac in US), electric fences, and various other errors while troubleshooting live electrical components. Yes, the stuff I could check while it was powered down, I would other stuff needed to be on during testing. 

No, I never did voltage test on a phone line.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_coq8le,TV Doesn't Like Being Turned Off,"Hey all, long-time lurker, first time poster, so be gentle.

I work for a secret agent themed service department for a large electronics retailer in North America and get a cross of in home service customer service and basic Tier 1 Troubleshooting of Home Theater system (I know it's not computers, but hope this is allowed here).

Had the $Client call in one night reporting that his Vizio TV would turn itself back on almost immediately after he turned it off.

I went through basic troubleshooting with the guy (you know, ""have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in"" and a google search for known issues), he told me he did his own research and called the manufacturer, saw an isssue where the CES would do that sometimes - disabled it, still having an issue.

At this point, I could have offered our paid in-home troubeshooting service, because we are just supposed to offer basic troubleshooting, and he was outside of his warranty, but I was curious, damn it.   Started going through some of the less-likely culprits:

\*IR interference-Remove batteries from all remotes in room in case something was sending an errant IR signal, still turns back on.-Checked for sunlight shining onto IR receiver, nope - not near a window and happens at night/dark room as welll.

\*Checked for another device causing electromagnetic interference (stretch, I know); no devices right near IR receiver.

Keep searching on google while talking to him, and I come across a post by u/HankyDoodleDandy, he had the same issue  on a different model of TV and shared his solution with the good people of r/VizioTV.  Turns out the dang ECO mode on the TV turns it back on after turning it off, client is happy because now he can remove a poltergeist from the issues he has to deal with, and I feel pretty satisfied.

Shared the solution with our team that manages our knowledge base and now I'm on a new committee at work, which doesn't really mean much from what I've seen so far.

t3_coqaie,"Please give me credit, even if I gave you the wrong file!","To give a bit of background on this story, I used to work on the Help Desk at a CRM software company and I now work as a DBA at the very same company. I wanted a side-gig for some supplemental income and I decided to take up teaching part-time at my alma mater, a university. My mentor warned me that there were some real characters when you take this type of job up and boy were they not joking.

&amp;#x200B;

I have patience, really I do, but sometimes you just run into someone that you can already tell is going to make your life difficult. I look back on my time as a student and well.. I've done stupid things and its never your fault, right? Always the instructor's, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

This story kind of skirts the boundary, but I did have to do a bit of digging and kind of help someone figure something. out. When you're a teacher or instructor in the C.S./I.T. discipline you kind of are at your student's only form of tech support whenever they have an issue with an assignment. Oh, did I mention that the majority of the students in that class aren't even in any STEM majors? That's important to keep in mind while reading this.

&amp;#x200B;

---

&amp;#x200B;

So, there I was, it was a rainy summer day and I was coming in to class getting ready to teach the ~~bunch of souls who are just thrilled to be here~~ looked like they needed a few shots of the delicious brown IT nectar known as coffee. 

&amp;#x200B;

The class itself was a Microsoft applications course, specifically Access and Excel. We happened to be on the Excel portion of the course and this student was one of the ones who was super-confident because their family was a bunch of accountants who used Excel all the time! So, naturally they didn't show up never shows up for class because it was too easy.

&amp;#x200B;

The due date for the assignment had just passed and I had spent the hour before time grading various assignments and getting caught up on some of the course-work. I hooked up my laptop and opened up my materials and started going about my business while others wandered in. During the lecture, my phone chimes and I take a quick peek to see a message from said student, who again is not in class. I ignore it and continue lecturing for at least an hour after that message came in and helping students out with the daily in-class tutorial.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, two more messages come in during that time, but the only indication is that my phone vibrates and I again ignore it. Class adjourns in the evening after a total of about 2 1/2 hours and I head home after having chatted with one or two others who had questions. I get in to stare at my phone and, of course, it's from a student who's not doing so hot. So the messages come in something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

Student: (Message 1) **WHY DID I GET A ZERO ON THE ASSIGNMENT?!?!?! I COMPLETED ALL THE STEPS AND I EVEN TURNED IT IN ON TIME?!?**! *long paragraph trying to justify why they should get full credit because they totally did the assignment*

&amp;#x200B;

Student: (Message 2) **DID YOU EVEN OPEN THE FILE?!?! I KNOW I TURNED IT IN!! HERE'S THIS ASSIGNMENT ATTACHED!** *I get two excel files in the mail and more trying to justify it*

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my policy on this kind of stuff is that you're not supposed to turn things in via e-mail unless I specifically ask you to. This worked before and without issue up until this point. They didn't even ask if I would accept it if they turned it in this way. What's more, it's' written on the syllabus as such, but who the hell reads that, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Me: So, I couldn't open your file which means I can't grade it so, that's an automatic zero. Normally, I don't accept files via e-mail so the fact that you sent it to me should mean that I don't accept it. If you want to turn it in via e-mail, I'll take it but it's going to have a late penalty.

&amp;#x200B;

I hit send, take the file and get slapped with about 3 more messages worth of ranting about how it's not fair, he should get full credit, etc. etc. To make matters worse about their e-mail submission, I don't even know which file is which, so among all the ranting, I have to send another e-mail asking which is which, to which I get a surprisingly calm and not caps-ridden response. Just to humor them, I open the original submission and, sure enough Excel can't open the file.

&amp;#x200B;

I open it the e-mail submission, compare it to what I'm expecting, post the grade and move on with my night. They must have been watching his e-mail for that notification and gone to check his grade, because within minutes of me posting it I get ANOTHER e-mail:

&amp;#x200B;

Student: **WHY DID I GET 50%, I TURNED IT IN TO YOU.** *more long ranting about how it's not fair, he's going to the Dean, etc. etc. I gave other students credit for turning it in via e-mail*

&amp;#x200B;

Student: *another message saying he paid money to buy software to do the assignment, oh woe is me, etc. etc.*

&amp;#x200B;

Me: You turned it in yes, but **I COULD NOT OPEN YOUR FILE** How is it fair to everyone else who did it correctly and turned it in on time that you get full credit? And you should be happy I'm giving you ANY credit. Look, this is what I get when I try *screenshot showing an error message from excel* As for giving other students credit, I **GAVE** them permission to do that. *Emphasis mine*

&amp;#x200B;

This is my final message of the night. I turn in after waiting 20 minutes for another message and getting no response.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day at work, early in the morning, I get another chime on my phone.. It's them, *UGH*.

&amp;#x200B;

Student: *Makes one final attempt, saying it's not fair and that they asked some staff members and students and they agreed it was unfair of me, etc. etc. The message is pretty long and it asks me to explain myself*

&amp;#x200B;

Out of curiously, I go back to the submissions and just double check. I noticed one difference from all the others... So I check my computer and--wait a second I've seen this! I open an Excel file on MY computer and sure enough... I see what happened! I had hidden files and folders on as well as show extensions from troubleshooting my own problem a few days ago. So, I respond. I also bring up something they mentioned during the previous night's rant after reading through all the messages.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: As I said last night, you turned it in, but it's incorrect so I cannot give you a grade as it's unfair to everyone else, but what you turned in is the file lock, which Excel can't open *provide helpful screenshot pointing out the difference* You may want to be more careful next time.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only had they turned in the Excel file lock, but they did the work on a Mac, which for an Excel and Access course is probably ill-advised. We can see WHEN you log in and WHEN you turn things in. They turned it in right at the cusp of the deadline expiring. 

I can only speculate, but I imagine that there was some setting on showing hidden files that was on and in their rush they probably just turned it in without double-checking. Whoops! Maaaaybe you shouldn't have waited so long and maaaaybe you should've sent a message before turning it in, but I guess Excel is too easy, huh?

t3_cohpwq,"If I Call Back, I'll Get A Different Answer","Hey all. I work as frontline tech support for a SaaS company in the midwest. We handle accounts all over the US and talk to everyone from business owners to ""IT people"" to actual IT support. We help guide these gentle souls through the hell that can be our software when it fucks up. Mostly.

So yesterday was my first day back after a week off to get married. I knew I should have taken that extra day.

Amid the usual ""How do I do this?"" and ""Is chanting supposed to be coming out of the speakers when I log in?"" came Bill (not his real name, I just don't like most Bills). Bill is a gearhead and not a PC guy, he assured me. A lot.

Bill got an error when trying to load our software up. I remote in and see the error. The data folder that the software is using has been moved from the default place where it was supposed to be. It's a simple fix though. I rerun the setup software from the server where the data lives on the client and in five minutes I'm done and thinking about buying a sweet HP DeskPro for my work-from-home PC again.

Slight hiccup. Bill doesn't know the Windows user name and password. Of course, no one in the shop knew them and the kid who set it up in the first place no longer works at the shop. I need that to get into the computer where everything lives and Bill can't help me. After explaining (*slowly*) to Bill what is needed from him, local IT, and the gods above, I send him on his way with ""cust was g2g.""

20 minutes later.

I am on a call with a really sweet lady who wasn't able to merge a couple of work documents together when I get an message from another tech. While watching the sweet customer marvel at the fact that she can merge documents, I look at the message. To paraphrase:

""Hey Nilmandir, I got bill on the line. Did you want me to follow your wording on this with the customer?""

I looked at the ticket number and sure enough it was Bill. I told the tech what I told Bill, contact local IT or Microsoft for assistance and then call us back when you are able to get into the server with a valid UID and password. We can't do anything with our software until they can log in.

Tech thanked me and went on his way. I can hope that 's the last we hear from Bill, but I doubt it.

Side Note: He had called in the day before because of the same issue, but we couldn't remote in because he could not figure out how to set up the remote. It literally is open a browser, go to the website, enter the access key, run the software that automatically downloads, and you're done.

M: Lets try opening one of your emails, click on this one.

she clicks on it, and again...

B: SEE?!!? IT. IS. NOT. WORKING!!!

M: Ok Betty. I'm not really sure why its not working, maybe your computer just needs a rest and it will go back to normal in a couple of days, sometimes updates cause problems but then they fix themselves.

B: Really? So if I leave it alone you think it will go back to normal?

M: yup, just give it a couple days, and if it doesn't go back to normal give us a call.

B: oh, ok. thank you for helping me.

t3_co6vv9,"How to print a brochure, if you teach CS","This story happened about two years ago back when i haven't discovered the wonders of Reddit and this sub. At that time, i was working as a 'lab assistant' at my college, that is, being responsible for a computer lab operation and general sys-admin stuff around the department, which included helping teachers and admin staff around computer-related issues.

 So, one day, a CS teacher asks me to help her with printing compendiums for her course. Compendium was made as a 54 or so page A5 brochure, which means that in order to print it you have to arrange these pages on an A4 paper sheet in a very specific pattern. Not a problem, since Word should've taken care of this thing automatically. Then, she gives me two documents, both with paper size set to A4 landscape, and both containing the same compendium, with the difference being that one had all the text on the right side of the document, and another had everything on the left side. Completely bewildered with this level of shenanigans coming from a CS teacher, i ask her what this setup was supposed to be.

 At this point i need to give a brief description of this teacher: full Caren haircut died black, notoriously irascible, with a catchphrase translating to pretty much 'i will piss off *everyone*', and inexplicably both lacking in her own subject and certified highest category teacher. She gives me a similar brochure that was printed the year before, and proceeds to show me, that i should open a previous year's brochure, find which page number is printed on which side of the A4 sheet and print it from the corresponding document, *one page at a time, for each out of a classrooms' worth of compendiums.* The thing is, judging by the state of the documents, the poor soul that was lab assistant the year before me had most likely went through this exact procedure. Even though i outright refused to put myself through such a torment, i spent about a week afterwards fixing the document and testing Word print settings. Among things that i had to fix were: manually numbered pages, indentation with spaces, page breaks made out of line breaks, pictures, that were placed over a bunch of line breaks and centered manually to fit in text and probably some other things that i do not remember.

 What was the reason for printing a new set of materials at all? From this year on, curriculum (which was made entirely by her) included lab assignments on *using Skype and Windows Movie Maker.* At the very least, i've got a sweet bit of gratification out of pointing to her a page in her own compendium that described all those things that i wasted no less than four hours fixing in her document.

I get in and check all the normal things; hub failure, etc etc. I then go to look at the server for these machines (this is 13 years before iPad and cloud POS became a thing).


Get on the server and it is fucked. Slow as molasses in an Antarctic winter. I walk into the room where the server was and I saw it. 4 Italian restaurant sized bags of flour on the rack above the server. I shut it down and pop the top. There was an inch or more of flour in EVERYTHING. Coolers, power supplies, the works.


I call the owner back and show him the situation. Apparently no one had ever told him that was a bad idea. I vacuum it out and then take it out back to a tire shop (it’s a shopping plaza) and use one one of their compressors to blow the remaining powder out. When I get back they had already moved the flour to another area and were working on cleaning out the room.


I hooked everything back up and the guy was super apologetic. Technically I should have billed him for it, which would have triggered upping his service contract cost, but instead I got a $200 tip (much cheaper than his expected cost) and I “swapped” a hub out as the culprit.

t3_cnwo3k,The curious case of the Friday evening system crash...,"So back in about 1984 we had an insurance system running on a Digital (DEC) VAX cluster in the Adelaide CBD (I worked for an OEM who wrote the insurance system software).

Every Friday evening the system would crash/reboot around 6:00pm.  In fact the customer scheduled no significant work load at that time (i.e. delayed the day/week/month over night processes).  I spend quite a few wasted Friday's on site trying to find out what was going on.  I'd rather be home, out socially, or pretty well anywhere else at 6:00pm on a Friday.

We worked with the DEC engineers to find a root cause, eventually tracked to a major power spike at that time (power monitoring).  Some additional power filters/cleaners (expensive) were installed and the problem mitigated.  But the root cause of the specific weekly big power spike eluded us.

Why would the power spike at exactly the same time every week?  Hmmm?

A few months later, having dinner with some friends, and one of them (Kris) works for a big local daily newspaper (now part of Murdoch, Adelaide locals know the newspapers). We are just chatting about work and stuff and I mention the power spike as a curiosity.  (Turns of the newspaper office building adjoins the insurance company building.)

So I ask Kris if they do anything at 6.00pm on Fridays? He thinks for a moment, ""Yeah we do a weekly fail-over to the backup power system to make sure it works.""

A little more investigation and it also turns out that the two building share the same power sub-station.

BINGO!! Root cause found!

$customer: young person, not really tech-savy, works for an architectural bureau we support.

Sometime around midday my phone rings. My colleague has $customer in the line for me. She tells me $customer has some issues with a temporary profile.

$me: *usual greeting and asking what I can help with*

$customer: When I log in I get a message that I am working in a temporary profile and I have to set up Outlook again and all of my browser favorites and local files are gone.

$me: Allright I will quickly connect to your computer and see what I can do. 

I connect to her system, log in with a local admin account and open the registry to find the key that refers to her profile with .bak at the end. There is around 15 keys for different profiles but not a single one that ends in .bak. and not a single one that contains a string with $customers username.

$me: So I can't seem to find a key that contains your username. Is this your first time using this computer?

In the meanwhile I check the C:\\Users\\ directory and try to delete the folder of the temporary profile.

$customer: No I have been working on this system since January

In the exact moment she had answered me,  I reached the users folder and saw a list of ""Temp.domain.local"" folders. At first I saw 10, then I kept on scrolling and scrolling and scrolling... There were 30, 50, 70, 100, and when I reached the bottom there were 125 of them. I slowly started to realize what must have happened here...

$customer: Well I did this everyday since I started working here. At first I found it weird but I thought everybody does this every morning when they start working.

$me: You really set up your Outlook and shortcuts and stuff everyday for seven months?

$customer seemed a little embarrassed at this point, but she handled it well.

In the end what caused the issue was, that my colleague who created her profile, put in a profile-path in her AD account, even though they don't even use server-stored profiles and he even put in their old long decommissioned SBS server as the path. Probably because he cloned an old, disabled profile.

Story: Within the past few months, we recently moved our HR department into a new suite within our office building in order to accommodate for a Mother's Room (required by State law), a new HR Meeting room and allow for better confidentiality for the HR staff and employees. As part of the move, the Director of HR received a new PC and other desktop equipment including a 34"" curved monitor, wireless solar keyboard &amp; wireless rechargeable mouse (keyword: rechargeable).

A few weeks ago, the director of HR submits a ticket to our queue, notifying us that their wireless mouse appears to be dead. In their description, they do notice there is a mini-USB port on the mouse, but they indicate that they did not receive the appropriate cable to charge the mouse. The day after the director submitted the ticket, they went on vacation until early August and came back a few days ago. While they were out, they left their office door open so I sent them an email letting them know I was going to enter their office and look into their wireless mouse issue (it is considered common courtesy at my company to email an executive or director if you plan on entering their office while they're gone). I make my way into the director's office and I immediately see the problem; the mouse is indeed dead, but the charging cable is in their office sitting on top of their PC in an open cabinet below where their keyboard, mouse &amp; monitor are installed. I grab the charging cable, plug it into the front of the PC and then into the mouse and the mouse starts charging and working without issues. I mention this to my manager and they just roll their eyes a little bit, but also suggest leaving a wired mouse in their office as a backup in case the mouse dies again. When the director returns, I follow-up with them regarding the mouse and explain to them that there is a charging cable in their office and let them know it was on top of their PC in the cabinet below. They laugh a little bit and said they figured as much. They also mentioned that they were getting notifications on their PC about the mouse battery being low and it should be charged (the wireless mouse is an MX Anywhere 2s by Logitech, which comes with software that alerts the user if the mouse needs to be recharged). I did also let them know I left a wired mouse in their office in case the mouse died again.

A simple issue fixed &amp; another ticket closed.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cnq1ie,"""Where did the internet go??""","Backstory- I was in the army, working IT. Signal closets get messy over time. The patch cables and premise cables were in sad shape in several closets. Having cables patch into a 110 block, go down to the floor spool up and back into the switch was not cool. It looked sloppy and unprofessional.  I decided that me and a junior tech would come in on a Saturday for closet cleanup. I asked for a volunteer to give me hand and they would receive additional training (along with a day off). I had made up a bunch of one-ended cables (RJ45 on one end only) to plug into the switch, clip off the excess, terminate into the 110 block, make them almost exact length they needed to be. 

This would require notification 3 weeks out, with a 2 week reminder, a one week reminder, and a day-before reminder. I sent out the network alerts reminding users in that location that there will be NO network connectivity on that Saturday from 0900-1700hrs. That meant no email, internet, login access etc (What part of NO internet users don't understand..?).

Saturday 0900hrs. We're there. Materials standing by and cable scissors in hand, clipping out huge chunks of CAT5 cable. We're pretty much done removing the old cable, we had a nice big ball out in the hallway. We start putting in the new cables and terminating them. 

1100hrs- A command sergeant major (the place is a ghost town, yet here's this one CSM), looks at us and walks by without a word.  15 minutes later, he comes out of his office and wants to know where the internet is. ""CSM, did you receive and read the network outage emails I sent 3 weeks, 2 weeks, 1 week and yesterday stating there will be no internet in this part of the building today from 0900 to 1700?"". He grumbled that he did but did not read them, he didn't think they were important. ""Oh.. OK. Well, they were very important"" He grumbles again that he has some very important work to do. ""We're getting the internet up as fast as we can, we should be finished by 1700."" He asked again where the internet was.. I pointed ""In that ball of cable, CSM"". He stormed off, never to be seen for the rest of the day. 

Afterwards, the job was uneventful and we were done by 1600. 

The lesson out of this- read emails with the subject line of  \*\*NETWORK OUTAGES\*\*, especially when it comes your own IT staff.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cnlysp,For want of a monitor,"At the call centre I work for, I work in software development and I do user support things between builds since I have a lot of free time. Recently, we upgraded most of our hardware and now must gather the old hardware to return (we rent equipment). We own some of our monitors, and the rentals all have a big sticker on the side indicating such.

$Me, $ES - entitled supervisor, $M - manager

So this was my day over and over again with all our supervisors (who generally get the best hardware)

$Me (To $ES): I've been sent over to do a hardware change since we're returning all the old equipment.

$ES: Okay, let me just save everything to the network drive and shut it off.

*Waits 5 minutes, despite the e-mail notices about this change today*

$ES: All done, I'm going to get coffee while you do this.

*I spend the next few minutes unplugging everything and swapping out EVERYTHING except the phone...when $ES comes back.*

$ES: Wait! You're taking the monitors too?

$Me: Yeah, the e-mail states all the hardware gets changed since we have to return all the rental equipment.

$ES: But I **need** my monitors, they're huge and it makes it easier to see.

$Me: Understandable, but they are rented equipment and due back now. It's not my call, contact $M, it's his.

$ES: I will, but I need you to put the old ones back.

$Me: Look, I have a job to do, and I'm not changing the job spec just because you object. $M is here now, go talk if you want.

*I finish up and return to my office to find $ES arguing with $M. I overhear most of the conversation and get called over to explain what already happened.*

$M (To $ES): We are replacing your screens, but we cannot lend out the same monitors you had since they are leaving.

$ES: That's unacceptable, I want those monitors.

$M: No, you don't get to decide what is unacceptable unless you have my job. Since you continue to be rude, I'll have $Me put the biggest monitors we have on your desk.

$Me: You mean the Dells?

$M: Yup

*I go to retrieve the old Dell monitors we have, which are...not small. They're Dell P973 monitors.*

When $EM saw them, her head darn near exploded. Since then, it's been department policy to give whiners the most reliable equipment we have. When HR heard about it, they all laughed and said it's within co guidelines so they're nothing they can (or will) do about it.

The next few upgrades went about the same way until the other supervisors caught on.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cnqtmo,Can't troubleshoot a locked door,"Short one that happened yesterday.

I work as a remote Help Desk for 500+ company owned retail stores (among other responsibilities).  A typical task we do is troubleshooting their data line if it goes down for some reason.  Among the first steps we do is power cycling their switch, router and modem.

Yesterday, I get a call and the new-ish assistant manager is in a panic that she cannot take credit cards, a common symptom of the data line being down.  A quick ping test to the router confirms this.  I direct her to the back room and start describing the equipment she needs to unplug.  We start with the switch and then the router, where she interrupts me.  She wants to know how much longer it's going to be, because the customer is getting impatient.  I tell her it'll probably be at least another 5-10 minutes at best and she puts me on hold to tell the customer.

When she gets back, I continue to direct her to find her modem and unplug that as well.  This is where she tells me that it's behind a locked door and cannot get to it.  I'm puzzled to say the least.  While every store's setup is different, the modem is never very far from the router, indeed it's usually right on top of it.  I relay this and she tells me that when she left the back room, the door shut behind her and her key is now locked on the other side.

I pause for a minute to process this.  She tells me that she will have to call someone else to come open the door and will call me back.  I assent and end the call.

A short while later, my ping tests shows the line come back up, so she must have figured it out somehow.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cnsiy6,Improper use of equipment or a lazy gamer sales rep?,"I work summers for a small-ish medical supply company that has several locations across the country, but I'm doing in-house tech support at corporate. I've worked a number of different positions at this company, some undesirable, before finally becoming IT this summer, so I'm pretty familiar with how things work around here and I'm glad to finally be doing something that I want to do. My task for this last week before I go back to school is to contact all of our $SalesReps with field laptops and let them know that I will be remote connecting to their laptop and installing our new antivirus software on it. This is also my first time ever using remote connection since I mostly worked on stuff in-house, so I'm excited and slightly nervous since I want to get it done quick and professionally, but I realize that I know what I'm doing and everything is going to be fine.

So I email a few reps and one gets back to me. 

$SalesRep: ""Sure but I'm already using another antivirus and just renewed it. Also I was going to ask $ITBoss to remove McAfee because its so annoying. Online now"".

Alright, so I go to my web-based remote connection site and see two laptops for his branch, both named under our company conventions. One of the laptops is online and the other is offline, so I figure I'm just going to send it on the one that's online and I hit connect. The session boots up and all of a sudden I'm brought to a screen displaying someone in the middle of playing Minecraft.  *What*? This guy tells me he's online and decides to slack off and start a game of *Minecraft*? The user then closes the window of the game and I take control, and check the user and computer name. Everything seems to check out so I'm bewildered and close out of the session, possibly in fear. I run downstairs to ask $ITBoss what I just witnessed.

$Me: ""So I just connected to $SalesRep's laptop and for some reason he was playing Minecraft?? Was I connecting to the right system?""

$ITBoss laughs and shakes his head.

$ITBoss: ""That was probably an older system that $SalesRep lets his kid use. Try creating a session and email him to invite him to the session so you can remote in to the laptop he's using.""

I come back to my workstation and see that $SalesRep sent me an email explaining that the computer I connected to was his old 10 year old desktop thats at his house and he uses as a backup and he lets his kid use it. He connects to the session from his laptop and I complete the install. I email him that he's good to go and to have a nice day and I see he quickly replies.

$SalesRep: ""Oooh one more thing please. Sorry I forgot"".

Of course you did. He goes on about wanting to change his email for some reason or another but as I'm not going to be at work tomorrow, so not my problem!

The rest of the installs I did today went pretty smooth though. No one was playing video games on their work computers, but I wouldn't put it past sales reps if that's what they actually did in their downtime.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cndsyi,I'm the temp and you will comply!,"After my [post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/cn5jyy/the_day_an_overachieving_temp_became_a_detective/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), I had a few users asking to hear about the story I'd alluded to at the end. This takes place during a three month temp role I held working internal tech support for a wealthy international tech company.

During my brief time there, one project I implemented was rolling all 400 employees in my office building from an old MDM (Mobile Device Manager) to the new EMM (Enterprise Mobility Manager). For those unaware, an EMM/MDM allows a company to oversee every aspect of their assets. This could be from enforcing HDD encryption, restricting web traffic, pushing out new company apps, forcing software updates, wiping the asset remotely, seeing what programs are being used, or even tracking the devices’ physical location.

It also handled the renewal of our network certificates; something that tended to break with our old MDM. Wifi/ethernet certs are necessary to even access the internet from inside our office building. So, if some bimbo off the street, somehow made it past multiple security checkpoints, and physically plugged into an office network jack, he wouldn’t see squat. Unless you had an active certificate, you were completely stonewalled.

Back to the ‘forced compliance’. For this project, I needed to meet face-to-face (one-on-one) with the roughly 300 employees that weren’t yet on the new MDM. They had to plug into a very specific (unlocked) port behind my desk, so I could make a few system changes. This would take anywhere from 7min to 20min for the ones that had trouble. To organize this, I created signup sheets in our online community with hundreds of 20 minute blocks staggered every 10 minutes (across a couple weeks) and had employees signup at whatever time worked best for them.

Everyone was contacted via a batch of individual support tickets that I would eventually need to individually close. They were also contacted via internal messenger or other methods for follow up. Most everyone registered for a time slot and over the next two weeks, I was able to manually enroll hundreds of users in our new EMM. These interactions were my bread and butter, allowing me to single-handedly raise my teams KPI that quarter.

Unfortunately, some employees were too busy (ie. important) to respond and a few even missed their scheduled appointments. Most of them were higher up in the company and could have easily terminated me (a lowly temp) if they were feeling temperamental that day. So, with my time frame on the project coming to a close, I got creative.

Going into the old MDM software, I pulled up a few of the users who were ghosting me and experimented on one by expiring their network certificates. Not ten minutes later, that ‘impossible to reach’ employee walked up to our help desk, as he was no longer able to access the internet. “Sure, I’d be glad to take a look at that connectivity issue for you.”

As there was already a certificate expiry issue with the old MDM, no one found their sudden loss of internet questionable; just annoying. More so, once they showed up for support, a member of my team took it upon themselves to enroll the employee in the new EMM. This both fixed the user's problem and allowed my team to confidently say, “this shouldn’t happen again with our new software.”

In the end, the only employees not enrolled were all on PTO or business trips at the time. Once they got back from vacation and realized they couldn’t get on the wifi, they would need to swing by for support anyway. Win win.

I never told anyone what I had done, as I wasn’t keen to get reprimanded, had an employee lost a sale from my actions.

TL;DR: Important employees are too busy for a short one-on-one meeting with me. So I decide to see how they like working without internet access.

t3_cn9omy,MOVE. YOUR. CAR.,"So I thought ya'll might like this story. 
I think it fits here but if it doesn't please just let me know. This story takes place last year in the South of England. Because it was last year it isn't word for word but as close to it as I can remember. 

The players in this story are:

Me, an IT help desk phone monkey. Give out tech support but don't go to physically visit users , calls that can't be solved remotely get passed to our device support team. 

My husband, Mike: device support engineer in the same company I work for - which incidentally, is the NHS. (National health service). 

Angry lady: aka, angry lady. 

Our story begins on a quiet weekday morning. The phone rings and I tingle in anticipation, at the thought of helping another friendly customer. (Lol). 

Me: good morning NHS IT help desk, how can I help today? 

Angry lady: you can get this car moved from outside my house! 

Me: *confused* im sorry, how did you get this number? This is an IT service desk, not a company related to cars. 

Angry lady: there is a sign in the car, and it says if I have any questions about this vehicle, to call this number! It is parked Infront of my house on my private property and I want it moved! Now! 

Important to note: all device support engineers are required to display an NHS parking pass on their car's dashboard, that tells people they work for IT in the NHS, and has the help desk number on it. The reason for this is that most hospitals charge to park in now, and this prevents the engineer getting ticketed. Mostly. I start to think this is a little weird, as engineers are not allowed to make home visits to staff that need support, they have to meet at their closest NHS building. Because network. 

Me: ok no problem, sorry about that. If I could take the car's registration, and find out what's going on. 

Angry lady: gives me car registration 

About three letters in, I realise this is my husband's car. 

Me: ok ma'am, just to confirm, can you please advise the make and model of car? (She does so, it's Def. Ours). 

Me: great thanks. And can I please take your address, so that I can advise the engineer in question. 

She gives the address. She is our next door neighbour. Complaining that we have parked outside her house. On a terraced street. Where there is no allocated parking and everyone parks wherever they like/can/wherever there is a space. 

I take a contact number, and promise to phone her back with an update. 

I call husband, who confirms that when he got home from work last night there were no other spaces on the road. He is not blocking her in (she does not have a drive way) and our road is not permit parking meaning any member of public can park there, and there are no restrictions, save some double yellows at junctions. 

I check with business support manager, asking how she wants me to handle a member of the public, angry about a car parked by her house, that happens to be driven by someone who works for the NHS. She tells me to go to town and do what I like. Excellent. 

While having this conversation, angry lady phones back and shouts at my colleague so loudly I can hear it through his headset. I ask him to transfer the call to me. 

Me: good morning, I was just about to call you back! 

Angry lady: about time when is this car getting moved from my property? 

Me: well actually, I've spoken to the engineer in question, who advised he lives on that road, so he would be entitled to park there....

Angry lady: it's outside MY HOUSE! ON MY PROPERTY! IT HAS TO BE MOVED NOW! 

Me: I'm very sorry this is causing you frustration. As I've explained to you, the viehicle is parked on public land, by a resident of that street  you have phoned an IT help desk for the NHS and as your call is not IT related, I need to end it so that I can free up the line, so that I may support doctors and nurses who are trying to treat patients. 

I hang up on angry lady. I would like to say the story ends there but she calls back and shouts at 4 more people. 

So. In light of this. I contact the council, give them the address, and ask them to please confirm if the resident of any property is entitled to park outside that property and demand others move Thier cars. 

They email me back, confirming it is a public street, anyone can park there, nobody is 'entitled' to park outside their house, and as long as no driveways are being blocked, nobody can be asked to move their car. 

I print the email. When I get home I post this email through her door. Husband's car was still there.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cn9et1,"""Then I'm taking you to HR!""","me$ - me

Eww - Entitled whiny worker

SA - my manager

&amp;#x200B;

Until a year ago we had 2 types of monitors, a 20 inch 16x9 LCD and a 10 year old 17 inch 4x3 ugly looking ones. We replaced all the 4x3s and put in 21 inch ones, but kept the 20 inches'. The department decided that unless there's a doctors note we will not move the monitors just because someone changes desks, which happens about 30 times a month, as well as people that beg for their newer monitors to move with them as well.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was moving this lady's voip phone to her new desk, which already has a full setup with 20 inches.

Eww: ""Can you also move my monitors?""

me$: ""Sorry someone else was put at your old desk, he has those monitors now. Plus we only move your phones when you switch desks, all other hardware stays. It wouldn't be fair to the other people with the 20 inches""

Eww: ""But I have bad eyesight and can't see anything on this""

I hear this all the time and this girl is young, no glasses/contacts, AND it's a small AF difference between the two sizes so I know it's bull.

me$: ""Well I can change the resolution to make everything bigger.""

Eww: ""No it'd be easier to just give me my old monitors"".

&amp;#x200B;

An hour later there's a ticket from her manager asking to swap them out. I contacted him and told him the reasons we won't and he was good. Closed the ticket.

Another hour goes by and there's a ticket from the floor GM. She personally went to him and then I told him the same thing. Closed the ticket.

&amp;#x200B;

Later I see her on the way to the bathroom

Eww: ""I can't work, I need you to give me the newer monitors.""

me$: ""Look, I'm sorry. My manager told me to not swap anything but the phones. Plus we don't have the adapters to put those monitors on your PC model."" (monitors had vga and DP, PC had vga and dvi. Had no dvi-DP adapters.)

Eww: ""What's your manager's extension?""

&amp;#x200B;

Later on my manager told her the same thing. Over the speakerphone he had her on I heard her yell, ""Then I'm taking you to HR!"" SA then called HR and warned of someone that might me angry coming their way, and explained we'll need a note to do what she wanted.

Some time goes by and HR calls up my manager.

HR: ""Look, she said she doesn't want to get a note and we really don't want to have to deal with her, can you please just do it?""

SA: with a sigh, ""I guess. Hey me$, go ahead and switch the monitors.""

&amp;#x200B;

So later that day, I go out and spend 45 minutes imaging a compatible system at her desk just to swap out the monitors and of course, she gets mad that she can't work because ""she has urgent things to get done"". As I'm doing so I get asked by another person with 20 inches to have her monitors swapped for the newer ones. I just say no, without the explanation I gave Eww.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_cnffq1,It's your first day? Strap in!,"It was bright and early on a Tuesday. We’d met our new tech a few days earlier and he seemed like a solid guy, but today was his first real day on the helpdesk. We spent a while getting him set up and showing him our environment, but after a few minutes, it was obvious that he wasn’t going to need much help. This was a relief as I’d spent the past six months training a revolving door of contractors and temps, and I was sick of climbing the learning curve with someone new every day.



The phone rang **ER POWER FAIL** and it seemed like as good a time as any, so I told him to take the call and I’d help him through it. Formal training is for other people... 



We’ll call the new guy m8 since he was a Brit amongst a bunch of rednecks and hippies and his accent stood out so much that, for a while we were accused of outsourcing our IT.



&gt;m8: Thank you for calling IT, this is m8, how can I can I help?

&gt;Nurse: This is NASCAR nurse, ah cain’t chart on my patients and I need to get on there

&gt;m8: What error is it giving you?

&gt;NASCAR: SQL client error something


In “terrible EMR land” where error messages never mean what they say, that means incorrect password. So, I told him, just unlock her AD account, maybe change her password. Easy peasy. 


&gt;m8: OK what’s the domain controller name?

&gt;Me: *fairytale unprofessional server name*


I’m giggling for joy inside. Some of the temps were BAD. This guy knows what a DC is. Thank GAWD. I might have a little training related PTSD. Or not. *twitch*


He RDCs into the domain controller, unlocks her account, and has her try it again. I would have used RSAT tools instead, but hey, the end result is the same.


&gt;NASCAR: It ain’t workin. You need to fix it, we’re busy and I ain’t got time for this sh!t

&gt;m8: Very sorry, let me change your password and we’ll try it again

&gt;m8: OK, your temporary password is 123456

&gt;NASCAR: YOU CHANGED MY PASSWORD? I DIDN’T WANT YOU TO CHANGE MY PASSWORD. I CAN’T REMEMBER THIS STUFF

&gt;m8: Very sorry, but that’s the only way we can solve this particular problem. Go ahead and try it

&gt;NASCAR: OK, do I type in *nonsense* or 123456?

&gt;m8: Type in 123456 and it will ask you to make up a new password

&gt;NASCAR: BUT I DON’T WANT TO MAKE A NEW PASSWORD, I JUST WANT IT TO WORK

&gt;m8: Unfortunately, m’am, that’s the only way I can solve this problem. Are you able to chart with the new password?

Cue more angry noises from NASCAR NURSE. In the end, the password change fixed it. Surprise.

After he hung up, he turned to me.

&gt;m8: You did that on purpose!

&gt;Me: ??? I wouldn’t do that, you’re new here

&gt;m8: You’re having me on. That was a fscking setup! No way that just happened to be my first call!

&gt;Me: Honest to God, no.

t3_cnfnvd,Send a Programmer to do the Heldesks job.,"My hospital is working on upgrading all our Windows 7 computers up to Windows 10. For some this is just a matter of re-imaging, but for about 1200 of them we actually have to replace the hardware. As many of you may know we are very quickly running out of time to do this, and since our helpdesk is currently only 6 people (including the supervisor) we struck a deal with our vendor. They would image and deploy the computers directly to our units, and one of us would just be there to domain the computers, less work for us and a little extra on each computer for them.

So the other day we send one of our guys (pd), who is formerly a programmer, down with the vendor to do a dry run so we can work the kinks out of the process. Pd just needs to show them how to remove the old computer and connect the new one without damaging the furniture, cables, etc. 

Before I go on I should explain that most of our computers are running HealthCast, this means that a non-privledged account is perpetually signed in and staff just tap their badges at a scanner to gain access to the desktop. 

About 10 minutes after we send PD down to the floor our private to the helpdesk rings, so I answer it knowing it can only be one of colleagues who needs something. 
Me: this is George, what's up?
Pd: can I talk to boss?
Me: boss is on a call right now, is everything okay?
Pd: everything is fine, I just need to talk to him before I can start this test run.
Me: alright I will put the line on hold and let him know its urgent.

I put the call on hold, and go over to boss. ""Boss, pd is on the line and says he has to talk to you about this test run.""

My boss quickly, less than 3 minutes, finished his call and picks up pd's call

Boss: what's going on?
Boss makes strange choking sounds.
Boss: hang on a sec not sure I heard you.
My boss mutes the line and calls us all over to his desk, once we get there he shushs us and then unmutes the line and puts it on speaker phone. 

Boss: alright can you say that again for me?
Pd: this computer has healthcast and is at the secured screen, how do I turn it off?

At this point the three of us standing by the desk almost collapse in silent laughter. But my boss, to his credit held it together. 

Boss: well there are a couple ways. Tou could tap you badge and use the start menu from the desktop, tou can also press ctrl+alt+delete to get around the secured screen (I personally only learned that a couple weeks ago), either of those should work.

Pd: okay I am through..... it has updates pending should I do those? 

At this point my boss struggled to keep it together.

Boss: we will be disposing of the computers once they are removed, do you think they will need updates?

Pd: alright I got it, thank you.

Boss hangs up.

My boss turns to look at us shaking his head.

Boss: I told him to go down and just pull the plug on it, what part of that was confusing?",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cn5jyy,The day an overachieving temp became a detective to catch company theft,"A few moons back, I worked a temp Support Desk role for a multi-billion dollar tech company. Basically, I was covering for another employee's planed three month paid leave. When I wasn't responding to countless tickets or wrecking havoc in Active Directory, part of my role involved asset management; including MDM/DEP enrollment of hundreds of brand new assets each month- mostly laptops, phones, tablets, etc.

Near the end of my short stint with this amazing company, I took it upon myself to inventory the build room and clean up their hodgepodge of databases. Surprisingly, I was able to account for every Macbook listed, with the exception of one. I confirmed it wasn't out in the recent batch of repairs and should have definitely been on a shelf or in a cupboard. Checked again; nope, not there. Odd. So, to appease my OCD and craving for mystery, I decided to investigate.

Using our help desk ticket system, I could see that a company contractor (let's call him Mr. Business) had the asset assigned to him one year prior. I reached out via messaging, where Mr. Business stated that, ""the Macbook didn't work for \[his\] software and \[he'd\] returned it to our service desk the year prior.” While this story lined up with our inventory database, it didn't explain why the asset had never been reassigned and was simply marked as 'retired' the entirety of last year. Very odd. Well, more digging for me.

With the help of our Access Management tool, (I had far too many admin privileges as a temp) I was able to determine that this missing laptop was accessed about 6 months *after* it had supposedly been returned to inventory. I could see what programs were used at that time, how long the laptop had been booted, and what networks were connected. There was also one additional bit of information available; the username of the individual who signed in at boot. A username belonging to our dear, Mr. Business.


He booted it again a few days later, for only a few minutes; making it easy to guess the Macbook had been wiped at that time. Pulling up our network logs, I determined that this asset had not pinged our internal network for around 10 months, which correlated with the unknown IP he had logged.

So, the picture painted was this: Mr. Business, who made well into six figures, borrowed a laptop that (for whatever reason) he failed to return. Instead, he decided to risk his career (well, at least his honor?) by lying about it and bringing the Macbook home with him- where it sat undisturbed for six months. Like a grade A genius, he booted it, connected it to his home wifi, and used it for one day- before wiping its memory.

Mr. Business was in the clear. That is until months later, when some kid decided to be an overachiever in a temp roll and clean up a few databases, trying to leave a good impression. I ended up compiling some irrefutable proof this guy was guilty.

No clue what came from it or if Mr. Business even still works for this company. I passed on what I'd found to my boss and knew better than to ask questions about how it was handled. Wasn't my place.

Anticlimactic, I know. Thanks for reading anyway.

TL;DR: A well paid business man stole a company laptop; then lied to myself and others about stealing it. Bad businessman, bad.

This actually reminds me of another solid story with this same temp job, where I revoked high-level users' network access so they'd schedule meetings for me to 'fix' their computers. Fun times.

t3_cnd8lz,"This time, I forgot about the basics","I work for a live entertainment video company, I started as a tech assistant and truck driver and worked my way up to a nice position with an office where I’m constantly testing new gear for new products, and I fly out to fix stuff if needed. Every tech in the company is also a tech support person, including me. 


Typically at a show or install if you have an issue you try to solve it with your own skill set, then you start asking the other techs onsite, then you call other field techs, then you wind up calling me, or one of two other people who know this gear inside and out. I don’t get too many calls these days because we generally have very good techs. When I do gets calls, it’s typically a situation where someone has been hammering away at a problem for hours and they are at the end of their rope.


Several months ago we setup a temporary show that runs for over six months. I flew in after the install techs finished so I could touch up their work and color balance the whole thing. During the run of the show we have some local techs babysitting the gear so they can respond to any immediate emergencies. It’s setup so I can remote in if anything needs to be reprogrammed, and the local guy can be my eyes.


So last week I get a call from the babysitter…


Babysitter: I’m having an issue with the big screen


Me: What’s going on?


Babysitter: It shows the test pattern just fine, but the actual video feed looks messed up


Me: Ok, is it the center hung screen, or the center side screen? (two wildly different products)


Babysitter: It’s the center hung screen.


This product can’t generate it’s own test pattern, so the problem MUST be in a piece of gear upstream, I don’t remember if we have a scaler that can create a test pattern in the signal chain or not, and I wasn’t at my computer, so I couldn’t look up the drawings.


Me: Do you have your personal laptop there? Does it have an HDMI out?


Babysitter: Yes and yes


Me: Ok, plug your laptop into the processor and tell me what you get on the screen


Babysitter: Ok, I’ll try to find a cable.


I hear some stuff being moved around int he background, then this…


Babysitter: Hey, do you think I should try turning it off and on again?


My head just about explodes, he should have tried that LONG before grabbing his phone


Me: Yes, definitely try that!


Then I hear him flip breakers. He didn’t power cycle the processor that was acting up. Nope. This chucklefuck power cycled our entire setup, twelve jumbotrons and all of our production gear! Fortunately everything came back online just fine, including the processor that was acting up. After confirming that everything was fine I instructed him to ONLY ever power cycle the gear that is acting up, and to ALWAYS do that before calling anyone. 


I don’t know this particular tech, but I hope he was just having a bad day and that’s why he called before doing the basics that every other tech starts with. Usually a tech has already power cycled gear, factory reset it, swapped out gear, and so on, long before I get a call. I made the mistake of assuming he had already tried that stuff, my bad.

TL;DR: I forget to check if he had power cycled the gear that was acting up.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_cn4qtl,"Ancient tech story from another former sailor, US Navy","Thought I'd post an uplifting tale of success for you to enjoy. This one was my biggest success working on equipment that was literally old before I was even born. So I was trained to work on equipment that handled communications for ships. Nothing super fancy, basically it connected radios to antennas for various operations. Since these were Marine haulers we'd have a dozen or so different commands with their own setups. I was lucky in that I got turned around out of my schooling to become maintenance at said school. So after spending months learning on broken down crap it bcame my job to make it work for the next few dozen classes and I jumped into it hard.

Now when I say old I'm talking just after transistor invention old. No fancy ICs here, we had ""cordwood modules"". These things:

https://i.imgur.com/B7tWVqA.jpg

The machine I was working on had been broken for decades and I decided I wanted it to work. On top of having ancient tech, literally hundreds of those little boxes and each one was a gate. XOR, OR, AND each a little box of discrete components with hair thin wires running all over the place.

https://i.imgur.com/hZBInpg.jpg

We also had ALD or Automated Logic Diagrams for it all from IBM.

https://i.imgur.com/ZAhhtkh.jpg

So you see, a signal came from another page somewhere on the left, went through whatever gates it needed then went out the right to another page somewhere. They did group things a bit, so the display stuff, power stuff, input stuff would be grouped together but it was also designed by engineers so the ""logic"" part was not always apparent.

So, the deal was, this system had an old monochrome green monitor tied to it that never worked. The teletype worked, the card reader worked, and the paper tape reader worked so that was how they did all their training but in the field they'd have monitors that no one knew how to use.

Shiny new crow on my hat and I jumped in to the display area! And found nothing. Actually I found a few spots where things were wrong but tracing them through dozens of pages I'd find it working earlier on. After weeks of hunting I was literally down to testing EVERY signal on EVERY page and learning ever so much about oscilloscopes. This was in between routine maintenance duties on things like hydraulic disc drives and reel to reel tape drives.

So as I'm digging through signals one night I notice at the bottom of a page a line. It crosses the page from one side to the other with nothing on it.I follow it forward and it ends up eventually in the display area where it loops back. So I follow it backwards and deep in the drive interface logic I find an XOR gate. So I test it. Good signal in, no signal out. Hm.

I go digging and find the module off in the middle of nowhere and get a replacement in which takes forever since fleet has priority.

Best guess? An engineer needed to flop the signal for whatever reason and ran out of XOR modules over in the display section but found an unused one miles of tiny wire away and just looped it in.

Got mad props for getting the system up and running again and learned never to trust an engineer to make sense ;)",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cmzssm,I think I got the new girl fired...,"Some background - Started working at my current job about a year ago on help desk, recently promoted to IT Specialist about 4 months ago, while still doing help desk things. This story is from when I was still on help desk. TL;DR at the bottom.

Characters: 
Me = Verbal_A_Saltz  
JM = Jerk Manager, thinks IT should drop what they're doing and help him because any inconvenience prevents him from doing his job  
NG = New girl JM's Assistant, been with the company for about two weeks  
$user=Enter username here

It was a typical day. Trying to knock out all my blocked tickets, but the phone won't stop ringing. We had been getting calls about people trying to access an Excel file ($File) on a network share, only to get an error that ""$user"" had it open, even though ""$user isn't here today"" (can confirm, $user wasn't logged in anywhere, and hadn't logged in in over 24 hours)

Start researching it, find out that there's an issue with this kind of document and network shares, but there's a workaround (but it doesn't work for everyone, and can't remember what it was). Also, find out that even though it says $user has the file open, it's half correct. The file is open somewhere, but $user was the last one to save the file. I don't have a ticket for the issue, so I'm not focusing on it, but I pass on my findings to my co-workers.

Phone rings. It's my turn to answer.

Me: IT, this is Verbal_A_Saltz, how can I help you?

JM: Hey, Verbal_A_Saltz, this is JM. I need to access $File to make changes, but it says $user has it open. (He sounds kinda pleasant, but I know it's about to change)

Me: Yeah, we've been getting calls about this, and we're looking into it.

(Cue his typical behavior)
JM: I NEED IT NOW!

Me: As I said, we're looking into it, and we'll provide an update as soon as we find out more.

JM: This is BULLS**T! I'm sick of calling this line, and you can't even do what your job title says. (Probably about another 30 seconds of him ranting about how much he hates the IT dept). If you can't help me, what can you do?

Me: I can continue looking into this to try and get it resolved.

JM: (back to ranting)
(At this point, I had a random idea on how to find out who had the file open. Open Computer Management -&gt; Connect to another computer ($FileServer) -&gt; Shared Folders -&gt; Sessions. Don't know why I didn't think of it before. See NG has the file open)

Me: I found it! Looks like NG has it open.

JM: No, she doesn't! She's working on something else. (goes on that I'm trying to get him off the phone and argues that I'm wrong)

(While he's ranting, I find out what computer NG is on, and remote into her computer.We use some remote desktop software that allows us to view/control a user's desktop through a web browser. She has FB open, and she's playing some game. I see down in the taskbar, she has Excel open, but it's minimized)

Me: I'm just going off the information I'm finding. If you could go check, we could confirm my information is correct, or if I need to continue looking into this.

JM begrudgingly agrees to go check and puts the phone down. I go back to watching NG's screen. She's happily playing her FB game, clicking here, clicking there. Then all of of sudden, the mouse stops moving for a few seconds. Then it starts to move towards the red X. I figured she was busted, and in my excitement of possibly being right, I accidentally moved my mouse cursor over the web browser, which takes over her screen, and moved her mouse cursor, causing her to miss the red X. The mouse stops moving for a minute. Then I hear JM yelling through the phone, but I can't make out what he's saying, but I'm definitely sure she's busted. Yelling dies down, then the mouse starts moving again. Closes FB, clicks on Excel and viola! NG had $File open the whole time.

Ten seconds later, JM gets back on the phone. No apology, doesn't admit I was right, just says he's all good. Calls finally stop coming in about $File (that day anyways)

A couple days later, I see JM submit a termination request for NG. Not sure why, but always thought that call had played a part in it. JM's boss submitted a termination request for JM a couple weeks after that (not sure why)

TL;DR - Caller can't access a file, I find out is assistant has it open. Send him to go check and he busts her playing Facebook games. She gets fired a couple days after the call",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cmzvl8,I didn't think a password expiration was that important.,"So a manager walks to my cubical saying an account reps email is no longer forwarding to him. The account rep had forward his email to his manager while he went on vacation for the week. ""But I figured out what happened,"" the manager declares. ""Their password expired."" He was talking about the account rep's Active Directory password. 

Me: ""Wait he didn't change it before he went on vacation?""

Our AD users are emailed 10 days prior to the password expiration everyday warning the user that their password is about to expire.

Manager: ""No he didn't""

Me: ""Well, that was kind of stupid.""

Manager: I know. . . . . Can you reset it?

Me: I CAN, but 1. not for sure that will fix the email forward 2. You can not have the new password (against password policy) and 3. this will mess up their mobile access to their email (so we need to contact them with the new password).

Manager: Let's just try it, but I do not think we can reach him. 

Me: OK no problem.

I reset the password, which un-expires the password. Evidently email starts flowing because I do not here back from the manager. I try to call the out of office account rep and leave a voice mail on the only personal number I have. Two hours goes by and then I receive an agitated account rep phone call. Let him know what has happened and give him the new password. ""Wow I didn't think a password expiration was that important.""

Me: Yeah, that is why we send you emails for 10 days prior to it expiring asking you to change it.""

Fast forward 5 days later to today.

Same rep makes it back to work and stomps in my office saying that they can not sign in this morning because their account is locked out. They tried the new password and it does not work. ""You need to reset it now.""

Me; ""Uh, you are not locked out.""

.....two minutes of arguing with me......

Me: ""Oh I see,"" (fake typing) ""Here try it now."" 

He walks back to his desk, tries it and calls me back, ""OK it is working now. Thanks.""

t3_cmsay5,"""I don't think you have enough rank to work on my computer""","Back story- In the army working as a computer tech. Windows NT 4.0 and Office 97 time frame. I get a call from the boss (colonel) to go down and load Office 97 on another colonel's computer. Was this story insubordinate? Most likely. Did he deserve this? oooh yes he did.

I go down to the colonel's office to do the software install. I knock on his door and announce that COL. ""cool boss"" sent me down to install Office 97 on his computer. He pauses. Looks me up and down and says ""Where's major ""other cool boss""?"" I tell him that he's busy and can't make it down. The he asks where's COL ""cool boss"".. ""He's busy and he sent me down to do the install"". The colonel thinks about this for a second and says ""I was expecting someone with more rank"". ""Well.. Both are busy. If you like, you can wait a couple weeks to get it installed"" I replied. Being a grouchy old colonel, he replies back ""Oh.. Ok... I suppose I can let a sergeant work on my computer"".. He gets up and allows me to sit down at his desk to work the install. I install the package and walk out, report back to the boss it's done and move on.

Fast forward 8 months later..

I get assigned a work order from LTC ""I don't think you have enough rank"". He is moving between commands. He wishes to move his documents down to the computer that he'll be using in his new office. I look at the work order, remember the slam I received and decide to write a nice document up (with color pictures) of how to create a share on the new computer, how to locate that computer on ""network neighborhood"" and how to copy/paste his documents from his old computer to the new one. I send this set of directions back to the good colonel and closed the work order.  A week later, this same work order shows up again. I took the directions I sent him, condensed it down to the ""readers digest"" version, send it back and close the work order. Week later, same work order. Send an email referring to the last two documents and close the work order again.

A couple days later..  I run into the good colonel in the hall way...

""Say SGT.. I submitted work orders to move my documents from my old computer to my new one and they keep getting canceled.""

Me- Sir, did you read the emails and read the documents with pictures and directions to facilitate this..?

LTC- Yes, but it was just complex and complicated.

""This lady wants to be escalated."" I take a long sip of my coffee and get up to go use the restroom. I come back and answer him. ""Details and send er over."" 

Lady is using *loan program* to pull pdf files out of *loan program* and into *not adobe pdf* to split them before printing each pdf to pdf, all with the same file name, and re-uploading the split PDFs into *loan program.* Yes... my eye twitched when she printed a pdf to a pdf inside citrix.

&gt; $Lady - Yes this is Karen with *our company branch number* I am having an issue with *not adobe pdf* failing to upload files into *loan program*. 

&gt; $Me - Yes *other tech* was explaining this to me, he said it really need to be demonstrated to understand. 

&gt; $Lady - Yes, that is the one thing he was right about on that phone call. 

&gt; $Me - Hmm (Slaps mute button) No he was correct about everything he said about you when he was muted. (Unmutes) Yeah go ahead and show me please and I can see whats happening. 

&gt; $Lady - So I open up *loan program*, download this PDF onto my computer, open it up here in *not adobe*, split each file and then save them. 

By saving, she goes to print and prints the split pdf into pdf using the *not adobe* pdf printer option. She names one file and uploads it back into *loan program* by dragging and dropping it into the file manager and then dragging each one into the folders. 

&gt; $Me - So you split the files, and instead of naming each file separately you are overwriting the files and uploading them into *loan program* one at a time?

&gt; $Lady - Yes. 

&gt; $Me - Ooooookay. I would suggest creating folders in your documents folder for each borrower and then deleting them when you are done. I would refrain from overwriting each file before uploading them and... 

&gt; $Lady - Its not me. Your program must be broken. I don't know how many times I have to explain this. 

I tell her ""one second while I check something"" and mute my microphone. I talk to the tech who handed her over to me and learn she gave him the same spiel. I walk into the break room and grab another cup of coffee. 

&gt; $Me - I checked with the network guys, no one else is reporting an issue with *loan program* so you may be the first one to have this issue. Go ahead and pull up a loan that you need to do this to and run through the steps so I can see where the error happen please. 

&gt; $Lady - You want me to just do one of the files I was about to work on?

&gt; $Me - Yes please. 

She opens up *loan program* and pulls up the megadocument and goes to print. She starts the process of printing a pdf to a pdf. 

&gt; $Me - Want me to save you some time and an extra step?

&gt; $Lady - I love time savers, show me. 

I back out of the printing screen and go back to the file and click ""save."" 

&gt; $Lady - But I need it as a pdf. 

&gt; $Me - Mhmm it is. 

I open up the file in *not adobe* and take tell her to do her thing. She extracts pages 1-3, 7, 9, 12-13, 17, and 20-23 out of the document. 

She runs through the process of saving each set of documents to the same folder named the same thing and uploading them 1 at a time to the *loan program.*

&gt; $Me - You skipped 9. 

&gt; $Lady - No I didn't. 

&gt; $Me - Yeah you did and I will show you. See here you went and changed the file name to *file name* and saved it overwriting the previous file. (Clicking along with her on her PC to show her in the re-enactment.) You then uploaded the file into *loan program* bu forgot to save it. Then you went to the next one and made it the same file name overwriting page 9. You uploaded that one and saved it. 

&gt; $Lady - No I definitely saved it. I know I saved it. I want to talk to someone else. 

&gt; $Me - Ok I will transfer this to my boss, just want to check one thing. 

I open up the file that she did not save and it showed a ""You have unsaved changes"" in the top right corner. 

&gt; $Lady - The 9 page is in there. 

&gt; $Me - Yes but it is not saved. As soon as you close *loan program* and reopen *loan program* you will find that page 9 is gone. 

&gt; $Lady - See this is why you guys are useless. Watch this. 

She may not have actually said watch this. But my brain thinks she did. She closed the loan program by force killing it in task manager to ""prove a point"" and then re-opened it up navigating to the file. 

This next part requires no embellishments. No fabrications. No lies. What happened next is 100 percent what happened to me a few hours ago on the phone. 

&gt; $Lady - Watch I am going go back into the file and open up and see page n..... iiine. Where did it go?

&gt; $Me - You did not save the changes when you were in it the first time and when you closed out of it the changes were not saved. Meaning they were lost. You will need to re-save page nine and re-upload it into *loan program*. To prevent this from happening in the future  you will need to not save each file as the same file name and save them as different file names. You will want to keep the files for a time so you dont have to do double the work. 

&gt; $Lady - Could this be a glitch in the system?

&gt; $Me - No this is just a simple case of user error. 

&gt; $Lady - But what about...

Every single response I gave her was doubled up with a ""But what about?"" response. Finally I just told her it was user error and that she had been given the fix. I apologized but said I had to get back to work and hung up on her. Pulled the call log and sent it to my boss.

The large format copier is offline, A copier shows as online but the attached card reader that rings up the copies isn't.  At this point we're all confused.  Tone for connectivity is good.  I go into my toolbag and pull out my cable tester which has the ability to test the run.  Plug cable into one of the problem jacks, repeat at the rack.  All 8 lights blink on the rack side, on the jack side light 3, then 6, then 1 and 2, then 4 and 5, then 7 and 8.  We realize the wiring guys who worked overnight have created cross connects between the rack and the floor.

Talk to the GC, he gives my coworker the number of the vendor.  He calls and leaves a message, emails our boss and whoever at corporate is in charge.  He gets a call back that afternoon, ""We'll be there tomorrow at 7:30am to fix it.""  We all show up the next day at 7, no vendor at 7:30.  Calls to the phone go to voicemail. Repeat on day 3 as well.  Day 4 a guy shows up, at 8:30am.  It turns out he had punched B at the rack and one of his guys did A while the other did B on the jacks.  He then had to check each drop and fix it at the rack (so now that rack has some A and some B).  It took him a couple of hours to check and fix all of the drops.

The whole week my coworker had been documenting and emailing our corporate overlords with the status and what was wrong.  If I remember correctly he forwarded me and our other coworker an email from the PM.  They were renegotiating payment with the wiring company for failing to do their job properly and wasting all of the man hours.  I do remember that they had screwed up another site after the one we were at and the company had them thrown out and replaced with a different vendor.  They were never seen again.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cmwe9y,"About children, cables, call-centers and social media addiction","So some time ago before I moved away from my parents city I was considered the ""tech support"" of the family and all of our friends / colleagues.   
Not professionally (like most of you) but as the tech-savvy guy in the family I was the one to call when there were any tech issues ranging from TVs set to the wrong input (with the owner unable to set it back) to completely fucked up Windows problems or internet issues.  

I never complained because I liked doing it, it gave me experience for the career I am starting now and sometimes a few of the people I helped even threw in a few bucks for me.  
But there is one moment I will remember for a while:  

I was doing some stuff, can't remember what exactly, when my father called me in panic telling me I have to go to a colleague of his *right now* because her internet connection is not working and she needs it urgently. I assumed for work.  

When I arrived there not long later I found a grown woman - not kidding - in tears about being unable to access the internet, primarily not work related stuff but social media.  
I always try not to judge people and I know myself how an unhealthy connection to social media can develop but this woman really shocked me, she began throwing stuff and yelling at her child (5 y/o at that time) while I tried to troubleshoot the issue as calmly as possible.

But I couldn't find out what was wrong. The router was connected, cable plugged in on both ends correctly, the internet was reachable from all other devices, I even tried to turn it off and on again. No luck, the windows computer did not recognize the Ethernet connection.  

At that point said woman told me to just call the ISP and let them tell me what's wrong. At first I didn't want to, as this didn't seem like an ISP issue to me but she kept telling me to call so I did.

I was greeted by a nice man listening to my problem and going through a check list with me. I have to admit I was annoyed. I thought I was smarter than this stupid check list. Of course I checked all of these things!

Then we came to the **cable**.
ISP: Is it plugged in?
Me: Yes.
ISP: Are you sure?
Me: Yes, of course. Do you think I wouldn't check that?
ISP: Could you please follow the cable the entire way with your hand?
Me: Are you serious?
ISP: Yes.

So I moved back the desk and did like he said, while feeling smart. 

Then I suddenly felt stupid. 

In my hands I held two ends of a freshly cut Ethernet cable. Turns out the previously mentioned child had access to scissors somehow and felt the need to cut the Ethernet cable.  

And that my friends is how I learned to value checklist troubleshooting and to never think of yourself as too smart.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cmr2v6,What do you mean it can't do that?,"I work as tech support for a company that provides pharmacy automation solutions to hospitals, mainly in the US, but pretty much everywhere in the world as well.

We get calls every day about technical issues, most of them being user errors or oversights, some of them being actual technical issues that we might or might not be aware of but, sometimes, we get a call from a customer who thinks the system is supposed to be specifically tailored to suit their every needs.

PL: Pharmacy lady
M: Me

M: Welcome to the technical support center, what can I help you with today?

PL: Yes, the labels that print out of the Zebra printer at X device are missing information.

M: Okay, what information are they missing?

PL: Well, it doesn't print out the prescription information and the administration instructions.

Now, at this point she has me confused. For the particular type of device that she is printing the labels from, there is no such thing as prescription information. The med orders come in, the user can select an order on a patient's profile, remove the med from the drawer and administer it to the patient. The labels that usualy print on the external Zebra printers, are barcode labels to identify the medication properly. 

There is also an intergrated thermal printer that prints a slip for certain transactions, whether it be a removal, a return or things such as meds that are stocked out or are getting critically low in stock. This can be adjusted individually for each device but, then again, no prescription information.

M: Just to make sure, we are talking about X device, right?

PL: Yes! The nurses remove medications and give them to patients to go home with, but the label doesn't provide the prescription or the administration instructions.

M: But, m'am, the medications that are removed are to be administered by the staff and are not expected to be used to as take-home prescription medications. The system is not tailored for this type of procedure as we do not keep neither prescription information or individual medication administration instructions.

Now, at this point, she begins to get noticeably irritated. 

PL: We had called a couple of months ago for the same thing and they had also told us that you couldn't do it but we think this is unacceptable. You see, we pay for the printer and also pay for its maintenance contract and we expect it to work as we please.

M: I understand, but the system is not designed to hand out prescription and drug administration information. It is designed to automate in-house medication administration and we do not keep any of the information that you want to have on the labels. Plus, the information on the label is hard coded and there is nothing I can do to add or remove any of it.

PL: You can ask your programmers to change it.

With this statement, she was actually serious. She thought that I could just turn around from my desk, shout real loud from my desk to just ""ask the programmer"" to make the change for this machine, as if it was just a question of changing two or three lines of code for a product for which we don't even release a version a year for.

I ended up finding the old ticket she had called for a couple of months prior and the other agent had told her the same thing and even had the product support engineers involved to confirm exactly what I had just told her.

We also have an ""idea portal"" where customers can submit ideas that is about as efficient as you'd expect from something called ""idea portal"". I walked through the procedure of submitting a resquest with her and she asked to be provided frequent feedback about the ""progress"" of the request.

She also wanted to file a formal complaint but I have never heard anything about it since.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cmysi2,Helm Hell,"I work for the US Navy.
I’m on mobile.
I’m a native English speaker, just can’t spell worth a damn.

I was holding off on posting this till the second part got resolved, we also just got back from a long underway yesterday.

For those not familiar with ship controls, the helm controls steering, the lee helm controls thrust. Both stations are manned up by seamen and Bosun Mates(BM’s) while being supervised by a master helmsman (another BM), helm safety officer, Conning Officer (Conn), and Officer of the Deck (OOD). None of these watch stations have seats and are forced to stand there for the 4 hour watch. That is the origin for both problems.

Story 1: Carpal Tunnel
Due to previous problems with the helm wheel being hard to turn due to watch standers leaning on it, we have to take a torque wrench and test it before getting underway. A few months back, it tested at 40 inch-pounds. That is less force than it takes to turn your steering wheel with power steering, but is considered out of specifications on the high side for our purposes. 

We place a new wheel and some of the assembly on order and was received a little over a week later. We go up to the bridge to replace it.  While putting the new one on, the BM sanding helm looked at us and said something along the lines of “Oh cool, you’re replacing the helm wheel? I was starting to get carpal tunnel from this thing.” The three technicians up there with me, my Cheif, my Divisional Officer, lee helm, Conn, master helmsman, and the OOD all stared like he was an idiot and the ten of us conducted training and corrected the deficiency on the spot.

Story 2: Mind as blank as the screen
The lee helm has no wheel to lean on, so the watch stander leans on the console. Evidently these guys have a fetish for leaning on the power button. There was hardly a day that goes by without us getting a call that the screen went blank. Every time we went up there we got the same variation of “It wasn’t me, it just turned off.” We knew it was BS and told them as much and instructed them not to lean on the screen, they never listened. They kept doing this till it broke, the screen wouldn’t come up to the right channel and the menus controls no longer worked to to the frequency of having to be used. A war was waged between us in Combat Systems, Navigation, and the triad (Commanding Officer, Executive Officer, and Command Master Chief).  We got petty. We placed a new screen on order and replaced it. Guess what happened, the fault followed to the brand new, proven good screen. My division is no longer required to respond for the lee helm screen turning off. As an added bonus, the BM’s now need to build a don’t touch that box to put over the power button so they stop “accidentally” pushing the button.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_cmwpe2,The little RAID that could,"A little context: I work as a Onsite MSP guy doing maintenance for a very large CCTV and access control system. 250 cameras and a rack full of storage and servers to run it all. Generally a very robust system, but not today. 


On to the story, TL;DR at the bottom. 


It was a very peaceful day so far, I spent most of my morning getting the ticketing system sorted out and doing some backlogged work. The client (a senior IT sec guy, very cool, very respectable) asks me for the serial number of one of the storage arrays, who had a failed drive after only a month, so we could warranty it. 

I decided to be ~~stupid~~ proactive and take out said failed drive just for a minute to take a picture of the label. So far nothing out of the ordinary right?

As soon as I pulled it out a second red light came on in the drive just next to it. Fuck. This is a RAID 5, so if two disks are gone everything is gone. 

I went into the office to check if the storage was still online, it wasn't. It was after this point that the client could read the despair in my face and I had to explain what happened.

I had to call my boss who managed to get the second bad drive back online and rebuild the entire thing without losing data, all while I finished almost half a pack of cigarettes and was considering restarting my music career. And I learned the most valuable lesson of all, don't touch anything important unless asked. All in all I could go home with a job.

I'm helping my coworker with a store remodel.  The store is staying open during the remodel so we have to move computers, copiers, printers around the place so the construction can take place in phases.  As registers are being moved around the security camera company has their guy out moving cameras and getting everything set up.

We come back from lunch and we can hear the camera guy swearing under his breath a bit.  I've known him for years so I go see what's up.

&gt;Camera guy: It's weird, I ran cable and some of my cameras aren't working.  I can see some of them on the DVR but not all of them.  Have you guys done anything?

&gt;Me: That's strange, we've been on lunch so we haven't done anything.

Camera guy starts tracing cables.  He finds that his no signal cameras have no power, which is odd since it's part of the cable he's run.  Then we hear the loud expletive while he's on the ladder above the ceiling tiles.  He comes down, goes marching over to the GC and drags him back in.  Points up to the ceiling and makes the GC go up.

Talking to the camera guy later we found out that while we were on lunch the GC had his guys start demolishing a wall that was coming down.  In his wisdom he had his guys cut all the cables that were going to the wall coming down.  Unfortunately the new camera cables went over that wall and his guys cut about 7 cables they shouldn't have.

That honestly was the least of the problems that happened at that site.  The network wiring was the stupidest issue and got a business fired.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cmigrj,I got friends in low places...,"back story- I was in the army as a IT tech. I had to visit a very remote location to service their computer systems at the hangar. The remote location could only reached by air. I flew out on a C-23 Sherpa transport with duffel bag and tool bag in hand. It was a 3 day job with a return flight on the Sherpa. I had spent 2 18 hour days working on the Aviation unit's  computers. This happened as I was getting ready to leave.

I came back from another part of the installation and was greeted by 30 brand new freshly baked second lieutenants (AKA butter bars) . I had my duffel and tool bag with me. I was a SGT at the time. All 30 pairs of eyes turned to me. One of the group of butter bars asked where I was going. ""catching a ride out of here this afternoon"". All of those green LT's started laughing. ""uh, what's so funny...?"". The LT that had asked said ""we're lieutenants, you're just a sergeant, do you really think you're getting on that plane?"". I replied ""yep. I KNOW I'll be on that plane."" The gaggle of LT's laughed again.  I went to the bathroom and took my time. I came out, all the LT's has sprinted out to the plane to ensure they would get a seat. I walked out of the hanger and across the ramp to the plane, got up to the stairs.. The crew chief yells out ""Sorry Sarge, we're full!"". The LT's laughed again in unison. Suddenly... Someone comes running from the hangar and up to the plane. ""This SGT came out here to work on our computers and network. He has a seat on this plane"". The crew chief looks at the closest LT and tells him to get off his plane. The LT is in shock and horror to having to stay behind. ""What do you mean?! I'm an officer and he's just an NCO!"". Crew chief-  ""Yep, and he came out here to work on Aviation computer equipment. His seat is guaranteed, you flew stand-by and your seat is not. Now get off my plane"".  The LT got off, I got on. The crew chief stowed my duffel and tool bag. I sat down in the recently vacated seat, looked over to the LT sitting next to me and smiled.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cml2gb,Faculty members vs. MS-DOS,"Back in the late '80s, in the pre-Windows days of MS-DOS, I worked PC support at a smaller university.  When the office workers called with problems, they were usually just normal, every day hardware or software issues.  The faculty, on the other hand, could be much more creative.  Two examples:

1) A professor called and said his system wouldn't boot.  We went over to his office, and sure enough, it wouldn't boot from the hard drive.  We booted it from a floppy and checked out the c:\DOS directory.  Instead of the usual list of files, however, we found that the files had been renamed ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", etc.  I asked the professor what happened, and he said ""Well, I knew those files weren't mine, so I renamed them so it was less messy.""  He didn't want us to reinstall anything, so we spent the rest of the afternoon figuring out which file was which based on size.

2) A faculty member called and said his hard drive was full, and he couldn't free up any space.   When I looked at the root directory, in addition to the usual contents I saw a directory named ""BACKUP"".  I asked him what that was, and he said ""Oh, I copy everything there daily so I don't lose any work.""    I looked in BACKUP, and sure enough, it contained a copy of everything under the root directory... including BACKUP.  I looked in \BACKUP\BACKUP, and again, it contained everything in the root directory, including BACKUP.  You can probably see the pattern forming here, so I'll just jump to the end; somewhere around 15 or 20 recursive levels deep, DOS just gave up and decided not to touch those files any more.  I had to reformat the hard drive to get it cleaned up.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_cmc1dj,"""Just remember, another office is getting screwed right now"".","I was one of the lead techs on a military post. Most of our users were in one building, in several units; compartmentalized in offices.  We would send ""the boys"" (junior enlisted) out to do the day-to-day tickets, whereas I was a ""janitor"", who would go into an office and blanket fix everything in that office and move to the next. I was in the middle of a clean up job when I get a ticket for another unit demanding high-pri assistance. I call the user that put the ticket in and ask that he hold on for 2 more days while I finish up the job I'm working on now. He'd furious! I blow off his attitude and finish up the job I was working on. 

I showed up to his office, told him to crank out a list of issues (to include the one on the ticket) and I'll make it happen.  At first, he was pissed that I did not show up instantly when he put the ticket in. This was a major clean-up and install operation. Several new computers, 20 new printers, 3 flatbed scanners, various user issues. I spent the next 5 days hammering out IP address allocations, system installs, software installs, profile moves, resolving user issues and teaching users how to use their new flat bed scanners. EVERTHING was DONE. (I don't like having to make repeat visits after a clean up, it means I did not do my job correctly)

The last day I was there, I went back to Mr. ""impatient"" with his list. Everything was checked off to include problems that were not on it. He was happier than pie and was showering me with atta boys. After he was done, I said ""remember that ticket you put in and wanted it done right now? Then got mad when I asked you to hold off a couple days?"" His face went sheepish and started looking at everything but me.  ""Yeah, I remember."" he said in a low voice.  ""Well..

Context: My friend, lets call him Bill, and I work as tech support representatives in the CCTV industry. Before working with our current company that deals mainly with technicians, we both worked at a different company that was oriented towards end users. Finally, one of the most common issues and calls were about connecting the recorder to a phone. While exchanging stories, Bill told me about this gem:  


A woman called in asking for help connecting her system to her phone, and Bill was happy to help: He asked her to check that the cables from the system were connected properly and he asked her to follow the Ethernet cable back to her router. According to the customer it was all connected.

An hour of troubleshooting every possible option later, the issue remained, and Bill was just about ready to request a warranty replacement, when he had an idea: He asked the woman to describe each cable and tell him where exactly they were connected. By the end of the descriptions Bill had figured it out! Turns out that the woman had the Ethernet cable connected to her smart TV, and she thought that the TV gave internet to the system using the HDMI cable. They connected the recorder to the router and everything worked fine.

t3_cmiaq8,When you mess up but L1 messes up harder,"As previously mentioned, fruit-based company as a L2 advisor (although we use T1 and T2). This is another long one.

This was over a year ago, about an hour before the end of the work day. I had had a shitty day, full of crap escalations and stupid consults and in comes another one.

One thing about our system is that we can see the name, vendor and location of the consulting advisor and others on the case. In this case, this guy was from my site, although we were a floor apart. 

Now, we generally are confident that our T1's will cover all the bases before escalating, we help with mentoring and supporting them throughout the day, but this was not the case.

The issue was what is best known as an iCloud lock on an iPad. This locks a phone/iPad to a specific account, although there is a hint that says the first letter of the email address as well as the domain. About 50% of those cases are resolvable on first contact, others require the customer to send in documentation to unlock the device.

The first thing we do in these cases is ask for the serial number of the device. This helps in understanding if what the customer is saying is accurate and if the unit is not marked lost (a deal breaker in these cases). In this case, the escalation was made without a serial number.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Me: Me. T1: The hapless first-line advisor

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*\*upon seeing the case notes and logging\**

Me: Right, where's the serial number? You need to ask for it.

T1: The customer couldn't give it to me, but he's absolutely sure it's \*this account\*. (\*this account\* does contain an iPad)

Me: You know that what they say can't be taken as gospel. Also, it's an iPad, can't they see it on the back of the unit?

T1: Oh yeah, but he's really sure of the account, that's why I didn't push for the serial.

*(Upon hearing this, I smack my desk and mumble a ""For fuck's sake"".)*

Me: Fine. If you're that confident, give me the call. But if it's the wrong account, you're getting a negative peer feedback for not logging per procedure.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I take the call, gather the serial and, guess what, the account linked to the iPad was different. Our system shows what names the users name their devices and the names didn't match.

10 minutes later and with the magic of research and identity verification, the device was unlocked. (the customer knew the password, just not the email)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

A few minutes later, I was finishing my last call when I notice a dude sit next to me. I had seen his face but never spoken to him. When I finish, I ask him what's up, to which he says:

T1: ""Hey, I was the one you spoke to a while ago. I wanted to apologize for not gathering the serial but I also heard what you said and I will put that in a negative feedback.""

I should point out that T1 and T2 were in different floors precisely to avoid confrontations regarding escalations (not like this anymore).

I took it lightly and told him it was a long day and it sucked to get a poor escalation from someone from the same site.

However, I went to my supervisor and asked to listen to the consultation. Sure enough, my muttering was audible on the call. She then asked what the guy wanted. I told him what it was, to which she acts surprised.

""He told me he just wanted to talk to you about something unrelated, I thought you knew eachother! He said he got permission from his supervisor downstairs, but he shouldn't. I need to see what happened.""

I shrugged my shoulders and left. On the elevator down, I stumble upon the T1 supervisor, who happened to be on my team when he got promoted.

""So, did you listen to that consult?"" - I ask him.

""What consult?"" 

When I explained to him what happened, he simply goes: 

""That god damn moron, he didn't ask for any permission, I would never let him go up! He told that to your supervisor? FFS, we're gonna need to talk to him.""

The following day I heard he got his ass handed to him by his management and got a disciplinary warning by HR while I got a negative feedback, which has 0 negative impact.

background. was working out a ticket to set up a PC for a new hire in a remote office.

M = Me

U = User

First off, when I reached out to the user they were logged into another user's profile, which is already a no-no. In their defense, they hadn't gotten their credentials yet and their manager probably told them it was okay.

*not* in their defense, I sent the manager the new user's credentials days prior; but that's not the subject of this post.

&gt;M = Okay, we need to get you set up on your own profile. is there anything you had saved on this desktop you'd like me to transfer over?

&gt;U = yeah, just these few spreadsheets on the bottom.

&gt;M = Okay, are these your files or &lt;profile owner's&gt; files? do you share them?

&gt;U = honestly, they're just templates that I grabbed off the J:/ drive. we can get them back from there.

now, I do know that the only drives IT manages or are aware of are a P:/ drive for department shares and a few folks have legacy personal H:/ drives (we're migrating to OneDrive/Teams/Sharepoint for personal network storage).

&gt;M = Wait, what's the J:/ Drive? Can you show me?

&gt;U = sure, let me open it up.

Proceed to find that the path doesn't point to a network path as I expected (\\AMXXXVF01) ""North America, Location code, Virtual Fileserver 01"". Instead, the path pointed to \\&lt;COMPUTERNAME&gt;\J:\PUBLIC_DRIVE

At this point, I'm more perplexed than anything.

&gt;M = so, your whole team uses this? 

&gt;U = yeah, the whole department as far as I'm told. I just started so I don't know the details.

I then proceed to gather more information from the user's supervisor and department head. Turns out, this is a 4TB External HDD connetced via USB to an old Windows 7 desktop that is due to be replaced. 

And an entire department has this drive mapped to their PC as a J:/ drive. They're all using if for ""backup"" storage and have ~60GB used so far.

I brought this to my IT Director, who then reached out to the Branch Manager to let them know this is completely not okay as it's a huge security risk. Anyone could just walk in, grab the drive and walk out.

We're now heavily pushing them to work with us in migrating the data to OneDrive.

There's no local IT presence at any other offices, so all work is done remotely. No local IT presence also means that these offices inevitably often turn into the wild west as the managers start treating it like their own little company.

t3_cm9hgg,User self-administers clue-by-four,"This is my buddy's story who works at the help desk of a medium sized woodworking/manufacturing company. He told me this last week in a series of text messages, and (with his permission) I've written it down for you.

## Characters:

$IT: buddy

$USER: Office worker who is not very tech literate and disliked by IT because he is usually condescending to IT. $IT has more than one story from him.

$BOSS: Boss of $USER, good friend of $IT

## For context:

$USER uses a 4 year old laptop and an external monitor which is mounted on a self-made monitor stand made out of a 2-by-4. It connects via VGA because $USER for some reason refuses to use Displayport or HDMI. $USER'S desk is in the middle of his office. 

$USER calls Monday morning:

&gt;$IT:   Hi, this is $IT from IT, how may I help you?  
&gt;  
&gt;$LUSER: THE FUCKING MONITOR IS NOT WORKING! WHAT DID YOU DO TO IT? FIX IT! NOW!  
&gt;  
&gt;$IT: Calm down, buddy. Watch your language! And there's no reason to shout. Is the blue light on the monitor on?  
&gt;  
&gt;$LUSER: YES OF COURSE IT'S ON! DO YOU THINK I'M THAT STUPID?
&gt;
&gt;$IT internally: yes
&gt;
&gt;$IT: OK, is the screen blank or does it say anything?  
&gt;  
&gt;$USER: It says ""No signal"". WHY DID YOU BREAK IT?  
&gt;  
&gt;$IT: We didn't touch it. Is the cable properly plugged into the laptop?  
&gt;  
&gt;$USER: YES IT FUCKING IS, YOU IDIOT!  
&gt;  
&gt;$IT: Calm down. One more swear or insult and I'll disconnect the call. And just so you know all calls to the help desk are recorded. Understood? ***long pause*** Now, could you check if that cable is plugged in to the monitor?  
&gt;  
&gt;$USER: OK. ***A couple of seconds later*** Ugh, Agrh, Ugh, *straining noises*  
&gt;  
&gt;$IT: What are you doing?  
&gt;  
&gt;$USER: Pulling...on...the...CABLE!  
&gt;  
&gt;$IT: No, stop it!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Couple of seconds later:** BANG, Aaaaah, Bang, Bang.  
&gt;  
&gt;$IT: Hello, are you there, what happened!?  
&gt;  
&gt;A couple of seconds later $BOSS picks up the phone.  
&gt;  
&gt;$BOSS: Hello? Who is this?  
&gt;  
&gt;$IT: Hi $BOSS, this is $IT. What happened? Is $USER all right?  
&gt;  
&gt;$BOSS: He's knocked out on the floor! I'm calling an ambulace. *click*

$BOSS told $IT what happened during lunch. Apparently he was on the floor putting his full weight on the screwed in VGA cable (because always screw in VGA), which lead to the ""monitor stand"" 2-by-4 coming loose and smacking him in the head, knocking him out and giving him a laceration that had to be treated at the hospital.

$USER also got a good scolding the next day from $BOSS, after he listened to the call.

$USER hasn't called the help desk since this incident, but has written an apology to $IT.

Maybe we should actually bring back the clue-by-fours.

**TL/DR**: User pulls too hard on VGA cable while under desk, monitor and stand hit him in the head.

*Update*:

Since some of you were asking, I asked $IT:

- $USER built the monitor stand himself

- The monitor surprisingly still works, because it hit $USER with it's back. Just the back housing is broken and the metal VGA port bent, with it's threading destroyed.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cmd39m,Computer is slow please help!,"So this just happened a couple of minutes ago.

Then I feel really hot air on my leg and notice the personal heater is on and guess where it is. You guessed it, right next to the computer.

Grab a case that looks like it will be a quick call and done. I don't have a ton of time, so that will be great! Call customer contact. He gets a user who was told of the issue on the line as well. We start a screenshare. User says that some reports are missing from a patient's chart that should have come through an interface. They don't know what reports or where they would have come from. All they have is the patient's name and that ""something"" is missing.

I look and they have a number of document interfaces, so I don't know which this mystery document should have come through. If we ever got it. And I can't find any errors on any interface lately anyway.

Friday:  
We reconvene with a different user who the contact says he was told knows about the issue. This call is the first time the user is hearing about the issue.

The contact says he'll find another user. One that knows that the issue is. And we can meet on Monday.

Monday:

One employee in particular is a great source of weird and whacky problems.  One time really stands out.  My office is less than 20 feet from hers but the first part was by phone:

Coworker:  hey there, my computer is broken again

Me: hi!  Is this Coworker?

Coworker:  yes, I don't know why but it's not working, I keep getting kicked out.

Me:  oh ok, so it sounds like the computer is turned on and you are seeing stuff on your screen.  What do you mean by being kicked out?

Coworker:  I can't check my email.  It won't let me in.

Me: ok, I'll be right there

At this point, I'm thinking anything but she just printed something to our copier and I'm able to use the internet, so I'm guessing it's probably a password issue.  I get to her office.

Me:  hey, so show me what's wrong.

Coworker:  see?  I try to enter the password and I keep getting kicked out.

Sure enough, her input isn't going into the text box.  What the heck?

Then I notice the problem.  Her desk is completely cluttered and she has a big fat file folder diagonally sitting across the top left tip of her keyboard.

It's pressing the escape key down.  Amazing.

I work for a company that sells machine parts from 3rd parties as well as custom machined parts. It's spread out over most of the US and Canada. I work in the US based support center (been there about a year at this point, moved up since then). The year 2015. The ticket notes help recreate this retelling. So, to the story.

OP - me
CE - clueless employee
M - my manager

OP - ""Good morning, this is OP. How can I help you?""

CE - ""I can't keep working like this. Why haven't you fixed the printer yet? It's causing major issues here!""

OP - ""Did you call previously about this printer or submitted a ticket?""

CE - ""No. Not my job."" (oh, the foreshadowing) 

OP - ""OK. Let me get some info first. Who am I speaking with? Can you confirm the branch number?  One moment please.
All the network office printers appear to be online and aren't reporting any errors.""

CE - ""I never said there was a problem with the office printers!""

OP - ... ""Could you please elaborate then on the printer you said was causing issues?""

CE - ""The label printer! What did you think I meant?""
(we have industrial label machines for printing bin labels or shipping labels) 

OP - ""Which computer is it connected to?""

CE - ""We boxed it up already but you never sent us a return shipping label!""

OP - :realization on what they were babbling about: ""Is this a label printer for your shipment system?""

CE - ""Yes. Are you even listening?"" *grunt*

OP - ""When did the issue start? Yesterday or this morning?""

CE - ""6 months ago!"" mumbles to someone ""...these idiots are going to put us out of business..."" 

OP - :eyes rolling: ""Excuse me but how have you been printing the shipment labels all this time?""

CE - ""I've been going to 'local po box store'. That reminds me. We need to get these invoices fixed too. It cost way more than what the sales order has listed.""

OP - :😒: ""Why didn't you report this sooner? We could have sent a replacement the next day. This is why we have a contract with the shipper. Those values are based on that contract."" 

CE - ""Look, I don't have time to waste with you. You're supposed to be IT. I wouldn't have to report anything if you were doing your job. Just get this fixed!""
mumbles ""I T must mean idiots"" *group laughter*

OP - ""Hey M, just had someone on phone that thinks we have a crystal ball for all their problems.""

M - :smh: ""Yeah, heard the tail end of that. Besides, our ouija board is broken.""

OP - *chuckle* ""Yep.""

Needless to say we shipped replacement label printer and a few weeks later they finally ship us the broken printer back.

Turns out they put the labels in upside-down jamming it and the thermal ribbon was backwards too. That was a mess to fix.

Also, an apology letter, about her rude comments, was stuffed in the bottom of the box to try and hide it.

This isn't the first time, nor will it be the last for those of us in IT. 

Coworker bought an 8 ball to give advice to those seeking a crystal ball response from us a few days later. Definitely some amusement from that since we'd tried to add the results to our phone conversations.

The worker in question was terminated shorty after. Her boss and HR got a copy of the call audio.

So here's how it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

Guy with problem = GWP

OP = me

&amp;#x200B;

\*GWP sends email\*

Hi GWP,

Something tells me you're not going to be able to get a connection whilst out on the boat GWP. Maybe try when you're back on land.

GWP: No problem! \*Noises of him sitting down and getting laptop open etc\*

GWP: I still can't get into the office OP!

OP: I know, that's why I need you to connect through your hotspot so I can see if I can help.

&amp;#x200B;

GWP: Nope, still not work!

&amp;#x200B;

\*Crys a little internally\*

&amp;#x200B;

GWP: Here I'll send you a photo of what it says.

&amp;#x200B;

And this is where the magic happens for me.

He sends me a photo of him attempting to connect through the VPN. Comes up with the obvious, can't connect blah blah blah. But its the one little piece of information below that just makes my day because I know he is trying his best to connect and he is the most gentle giant you'd ever meet.

His next comment being: ""Shall we try another laptop?""

I could of laughed, I could of cried. But it made my day. After spending the next 30 minutes explaining to him that I doubt he's going to be able to get in, let alone why he shouldn't whilst he's on annual leave. It made me chuckle and when telling others in the office we all laughed because we know he has the best intentions.

&amp;#x200B;

thought this might be worthy of the tales here.

t3_clxw44,What do you do for work,"I used to install car alarms and remote starters for an automotive shop.

I installed a car alarm in customer's car that comes with a key-less entry key fob. The lock and unlock buttons arm and disarm the alarm as well as control the locks on the doors. No problems, totally routine.

The next day customer returns to the shop complaining that his key fob is no longer working. He hands it to me and sure enough, no response from the car.

These alarm units have a sequence of button presses etc to pair and reprogram the key fobs. I attempt to pair the customer's current fob to the alarm unit, but it fails to recognize it. Hmm strange.

I get a new fob from off the shelf and try the pairing again. Works perfect. Great. See you later. It's under warranty.

Next day customer is back again, same deal. Fob that I paired yesterday no-longer works and won't pair again. Grab a new one, pairs straight away. See you later.

Customer returns for a third time. OK, something is fishy here.

I ask the customer:
&gt;""what do you do for a living?""

He says
&gt;""I'm a welder.""

(internally) Bingo!

I ask him:
&gt;""Do you keep your keys in your pocket while you're at work?""

t3_clqqyv,The internet hates my wife.,"This happened many years ago when the internet was newish to consumers and people were still using dial up to access it.

I was working for a PC manufacturer in a call centre as a second level support agent.  I took an escalation call that had been passed on by another L2 agent who was at his wits end.

&gt;Husband: the internet works fine for me but not for my wife.  Every time she goes to use it, it disconnects.

Previous techs had tried all the basics, but no love from the internet for her.  Even if he left it connected the minute she sat down to use the computer it would disconnect.

Eventually, I was reminded of another client who couldn't use the internet between 3pm - 6pm and 5am - 7am.  That was because that's when his neighbors electric fence was turned on and the cheap modems that we were shipping were so sensitive to outside RF interference that the fence was enough to prevent his modem from connecting, we resolved that by shipping a hardware modem instead of the usual soft modem.

So, I started digging into the situation.  Was anything electric running that she was using that her husband wasn't?  I was thinking maybe an electric wheelchair, turns out I was close.  She had a prosthetic arm that had some kind of motor in it to open and close the hand, that was enough to knock out the modem.  Solution was to send a hardware modem, after that the internet stopped hating his wife.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_clstn8,Tales from the past - The Magic Computer,"In the late 80s, early 90s I got re-involved with a charity that was trying to help disabled people, especially those with progressive illnesses, stay in work.

One of the clients had multiple sclerosis. She was a talented architect in her mid 50s and was the senior partner of a practice. Unfortunately the MS had become so bad that she could no longer go to the office to work. She was wheelchair bound and needed a 24 hour carer. But there was nothing wrong with her brain or her vision of how building should be designed.

This was driving her crazy so we arranged a home office for her using the highest specked PC we could think of at the time. It had a Wacom tablet that weighed a lot, an A3 plotter as well as a daisywheel printer and a early model Dragon Dictate card. The computer ran AutoCAD software.

We spent a couple of weeks recording the verbal commands for controlling the software as she spoke them and matching them to the appropriate keystrokes. Think “Undo” matching to CNTRL-Z etc.

Eventually we got it all working and she was a happy bunny. Then I got a call from her carer saying that she had a problem and could I call in. 

Me: Hi Bunny - what’s your problem

Bunny: the computer is magic - It’s doing things to my designs before I tell it to.

I’m somewhat confused as I has never heard of a computer that could predict future action except in Science Fiction.

Bunny: I see you don’t believe me but if you can stick around I’ll show you.

She starts working on an incredibly complex drawing for some restoration project she was working on. Then all of a sudden she has a spasm and the Wacom tablet’s stylus goes flying and the drawing has a huge line added to it. Almost simultaneously she yells ""OH F\*\*K"".

The computer thinks for a second and removes the line.

Bunny: See I was going to tell it to undo the last operation but it has done it already. It’s magic.

Me: Is it a problem? - I can make sure it doesn’t happen again.

Bunny: DON’T YOU DARE. Do you think it will learn to read other thoughts? Could I get it to do more things?

Me: I don’t think so - it could have unintended consequences - best left alone I think. 

However I did get a brand decal made for the computer that said “Magic Computer”.

She was happy and told everyone who came to see her that was worried she couldn’t produce the work that she didn’t have a problem with her work and her MS because she had a magic computer.

I didn’t tell her that I had mapped her ""OH F\*\*K"" sound file to the undo command also.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_clnnp0,Hero To The People or: The Case of the Confidential Password,"Here's a short tale on how my school's administration manager declared me a Hero To The People. 

A little bit of background: My school has three distinct networks - a semi-public one (which all teachers and pupils can connect to and which is obviously ranked lowest in the router's list of priorities), a private one for all the school's PCs and a seriously locked down one for the administrative and privileged stuff. The latter one also isn't supervised by our school's own IT staff but by a dedicated company (The Company from hereon) which solely does this kind of work for our state.

They're also a bit weird. You'll see.

That much for the background. On to the story!

So, our administrator (let's call him Felix) has this really powerful laser printer. Coloured prints, duplex, \*really\* fast, stapler, everything you might need to print lots of documents (be that certificates or disciplinary records). Costs a considerable four-figure sum.

He recently had to replace the fuser - that one was easily done: Open the lid, pop out the old one, push new one in, close lid and reset the fuser counter.

It was the last step where he hit a small snag: The menu in which to reset the counter was password protected. The Company in its undecipherable wisdom had decided that because the printer was connected to the administrative network that all its features needed to be locked down. Hence the password. I'm not precisely sure what havoc the maintenance menu could wreak on the network but hey! And yes, maintenance menu. This printer also had a *separate* configuration menu (protected by a different password).

Off to the support hotline he went to answer the riddles three - promptly to be thrown into the abyss.

Felix: ""So you see, I kind of need this password?""  
Support: ""You cannot handle the ~~truth~~ password!""

For some reason this then resulted in a three months standoff after which The Company could finally be persuaded to dispatch a technician.

Come the day of His Arrival:  
Felix: ""Good morning! You can help me with this password issue?""  
Technician: ""You cannot handle the ~~truth~~ password!""  
Felix: ""Yeah, I kind of figured that out by now. That's why **you** are here, after all, right?""  
Technician: ""I ~~can't handle the truth~~ am not allowed to know the password either!""  
Felix: *\*twitch\**

Yeah, the rest of the meeting went equally well. The proposed solution was thus: Buy a new printer (remember the four-figure cost? That would come out of *our* budget!) and **scrap** the old one (because it had been contaminated by secrets!)

Needless to say, Felix didn't think much of that ""solution"" and that's when he approached me. The rest of the story is somewhat anticlimactic:

I had a look at the printer and it definitely had a bit more computing power in there than your usual $30 printer from Walmart. In a flash of inspiration I also remembered that most devices have some hardware capability of resetting stuff to factory settings. A quick Google search yielded a video on YouTube how to do just that for this exact model of printer (you can find tutorial videos for the most insanely off-track devices on there. Now, if those guys could just reduce their waffling from ten minutes down to the actual 30 seconds of relevant stuff...). One minute with a screw driver and a change of position for a jumper and presto!

No more password. And yes, the default configuration works just fine, too.

It was then that I received my title of Hero To The People.

For about one day, after which had to talk to my principal who for some weird reason is not that keen on new and exciting blotches of colour on the ceiling (I'm also a chemistry teacher).",talesfromtechsupport

Then she yells at me that I was responsible for her home wifi not working.
We strictly are not supposed to troubleshoot the users personal devices.
Still I make her restart the router and check and the wifi still doesn't work. So I tell her to check with her service provider as it is out of support for us, she was pissed as shit when I told that, she wanted me to contact her service provider and check as I am IT and should deal with it.
Tried explaing her that this is corporate tech support and we do not deal with personal device issue and will have to speak to her service provider herself.

CK : (yelled at me) Do you know how much work I've got to do and how important it is and because of YOU I cannot do my work. I will escalate to the management and get you fired right now and make sure you don't get a job again.

Me: I'll do that once I make sure of what account is on the phone. I believe you, but I can't move on without making sure. (I can, I just wanted to rub it in her face)

K: Ugh, you're being unbearable! Just reset the password! I'm making lunch and I have a child with me, I don't have time for this.

Me: Alright then. Regardless of the account, I need to verify the accountholder's identity and I need to speak to your father directly, is he on the line?

K: My God, you're being insufferable! He's upstairs, I'll get him. \*finds father and hands him the phone\*

EM: Hello?

Me: Hi there, EM. Please do me a favour. I need to verify your identity but I need to know what's the correct account first.

EM: Of course.

(guide him through the Settings and confirm the correct account)

Me: Thank you so much, your daughter was convinced it was the other account and we would've been on a wild goose chase.

\*inaudible talking from the daughter\*

EM: Be quiet, daughter, I'm talking to the man. \*put call on mute and agree with the gentleman\*

(we eventually manage to verify his identity and schedule a password reset email to be sent to an alternative account)

Me: So that's it, you just need to wait for the email, click on the link and create a new password. You'll be able to download your apps afterwards.

EM: Thank you so much, young man. Sorry for taking your time and not knowing how to work the phone well.

Me: That's perfectly fine, EM. Call us if you need anything.

t3_cl8oht,Ineptitude^2,"A most recent tale of the most inept person I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with.

This fine example of divergent evolution had to configure a VPN token on her phone to remotely access our network.

The process is fairly simple for anyone capable of tying their shoes or using a spoon. You download something on your phone, enter your credentials on our webpage and scan the QR code on screen with your phone when it shows up. Then you enter the resulting code under the QR code.

&amp;nbsp;

I tried to explain this process as simply as I could, but the user got stuck on finding the QR code. I asked her if she could see ""A black and white square with 3 black corners"" on their screen, which, of course, she could not. 

Being unable to describe to me what she was seeing with her own eyes, I managed to get her to send me a screen capture. I was sent a dropbox link with a terribly pixilated JPG. In this image, I saw that she had scrolled all the way down the page and, thus, could no longer see the QR code, because she had not yet attained object permanence. After much effort, I'd managed to get her to look directly at the QR code. She described it as: ""A black and white square with 3 black corners"", and assured me with great confidence that this was not, in fact, a QR code. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now came the step of scanning the code. I asked her to press ""configure by scanning"" on her phone and to scan the code. She spent 3 minutes scanning the lint and partially eaten crayons on her desk, then asked me when the process would be over. I had to told her to lift her arm and scan the code on the screen.

&amp;nbsp;

Once the code had been scanned, her phone started giving her a 6 digit code to plug into the webpage. That code changes every 30 seconds. This arduous process took her more than 30 seconds. By some miracle, she managed to gain access after a few tries.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, she could download the thing she came for on our page. I got her to click on the bigass ""DOWNLOAD HERE"" button, but she told me that nothing was happening. I told her to describe what she was seeing to me: ""2019 October, a black cat"". She had opened her download folder and started clicking on random things instead of the thing she had just downloaded. 

She told me that the process was taking too long and that now she was tired and hung up.

t3_cl4wun,OH MY GOD!! What do you mean?!,"This JUST happened and now I'm taking a break, so here I am...

:Admin

:ME

One of the things that I do at work is build Cisco phones for new hires, replacements for failed devices (fracking data ports!), SNR, EM... all of that.

We have large number of offices and *most* have a Deskside team who would provide the appropriate MAC address of the phone to build. For the offices who do NOT have support, we contact the manager - how THAT often goes could be a whole other post.

A ticket comes in for a new hire who will be located in an office that does not have a support team onsite. I contact the manager who passes it off to his administrative assistant, who he says is new to the position, but ""pretty good with computers."" Not yet having lost ALL hope, I say great and give her a call...

Me: Hey Admin, I have a ticket for NEW-HIRE reporting to MANAGER and MANAGER told me to contact you to get the MAC address of a phone to build for her.

...and this is where I learn that she is either having a REALLY super bad day and/or is just a total and complete, uh.... not-nice-person. This horrible attitude of hers, right or wrong, prompted my final comments to her.

Admin: Well, that's just great, isn't it? I have no idea what the heck a MAC address is and now I'm supposed to go running around the building in search of something that I've never heard of?

...I have her go to the desk location in the ticket and on the Cisco phones that we use, it's a simple GEAR button, #4 to get the MAC. She does that without trouble and reads it off to me.

Admin: I don't know how I got stuck doing this, I'm not the phone guy. Are you going to actually DO anything with the number that I just gave you or was all of this just busy work for me?

ME: I'll log into the Cisco systems and build the profile for NEW-HIRE so that on her start date, she'll come in to find a working phone with her name &amp; extension on the desk.

Admin: Yeah, well, there is already some personal stuff on this desk and a crapload of dust.

Me: She doesn't start until 8/12, that must have been left behind by the previous person. Usually that would have been cleared away, any maybe still will be, but without a local team there I'm not sure how that will handled.

Admin: NEW-HIRE will be given a phone used by someone else?

Me: Well... yes.

Admin: That's so gross. Someone has had their hands all over it and has held the handset up to their ears. There will be germs, oils and all kinds of stuff all over that phone. That's just plain bad practice.

Me: It's not feasible to provide a new phone to every person who needs a phone. The cost and overhead of providing a brand new phone to everybody would destroy the budget. Some of the offices have Clorox wipes that people can use for all kinds of things, including wiping down the phone, I guess.

Admin: No, that's gross and just shouldn't be done. I would NEVER use someone else's phone.

t3_cl3qfc,Please use your eyes....please?,"Context: My work has a custom word menu. the menu is split into two parts, the first being standard templates, the second being printing macros. You accessed it by going to a ribbon in word called 'add-ins' and there were two separate menus.

&amp;#x200B;

This menu was originally created and only amendable using word 2000. It is an important part of our environment, both for every day usage and for compliance purposes. It has to be on everyones PC.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been wanting to replace it for years with something that doesnt require Word 2000 to edit it. I built a new menu using word 2010 about 18 months ago, and ran it alongside the old menu. The idea was to get people used to the new menu, as while it had the same options, the layout was different. each section had it's own ribbon, which was clearly marked. I sent out an email with screenshots and red boxes indicating where users could find things. i made it clear that if they didn't have the new menu or couldn't find anything, to get in contact.

&amp;#x200B;

I hadn't retired the old menu yet as I had not found a way to push the menu onto a rdp environment until recently. When i got it working, and tested it successfully over a period of time, I sent another email out, going over the new menu, where everything was, and announcing that the old menu would be retired on the 1st August.

&amp;#x200B;

So onto the story. i remove the old menu, and await the calls. odd. nothing. so i forget. until late afternoon, when i have two calls back to back that made me facedesk.

t3_cl4fo4,"I'm a very busy man, I don't have much time!","Hi. I've posted here before, but I figured I'd give some background info again; Our company sells security materials, which includes CCTV material and everything related (servers for VMS systems, tech support for the IP-camera's etc). We're pretty much a distributor and we only sell to installers who install products for end-users. 95% of our clients have a basic understanding of IT and as such have no issue installing the security materials and only call when there's a product-specific issue. In fact, in this line of business, it's kind of required to have at least some basic knowledge of IT.  

In this case our customer calls us and tells me he has an issue with one of his customers (B2B and all that). His PC was doing strange things with the VMS program that was supposed to run on it and I had a hard time figuring out whether it was the actual VMS or the PC that was giving the issue. We e-mail back and forth trying a few things until his customer snaps at my customer and tells him he wants it fixed ASAP or he won't pay his bills. My customer asks if I can't call his customer. 

""Sure,"" I said. Normally we don't do this being B2B, but I decided to help my customer out on this. 

I call his customer. Let's call him **OhHiMark**. I'm **me** (duh).

&gt;**Me:** ""Hello, am I speaking with OhHiMark?   
&gt;  
&gt;**OhHiMark:** ""Yes. You're calling about the computer right? Can you fix it already?""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** ""I can certainly try. Can I get a teamviewer access to your computer?""  
&gt;  
&gt;**OhHiMark:** ""No.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** ""No?""  
&gt;  
&gt;**OhHiMark:** ""Yes, I have teamviewer reserved for other purposes for my business and I don't need you guys breaking it. If teamviewer stops working I lose a day worth of business.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** ""Oh. Okay. Well then I can't connect I'm afraid.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**OhHiMark:** ""Yes you can, use Anydesk!""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** ""...Sure. I'll download it. Give me a minute.""

So I download Anydesk and he gives me his ID. I log on and I check out the PC. 

&gt;**Me:** ""Hmm. Something's definitely wrong. I'd like to confirm a few things with the manufacturer of the VMS to make sure we're on the right track, would that be alright with you sir?""  
&gt;  
&gt;**OhHiMark:** ""Yes, whatever. I'm a very busy man. Do you know how many people I have under me?! Just get it fixed.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** ""Alright. ""

I hang up  the phone but stay connected to his PC. I dial the number to our manufacturer and within seconds I'm in a call with them. I explain the issue, we go back and forth a bit and this goes on for about 5 minutes. Suddenly out of the corner of my eye I see him moving his mouse and I see it going to the START-menu. He opens freaking solitaire and starts playing it. During the entire conversation I had with our manufacturer, which was a good 20 minutes, he was playing the game. Even after I hung up he kept playing. The only reason why he stopped playing is because I called him again.

&gt;**Me:** ""Okay so I have some news.""

Suddenly he remembers I'm still connected to his computer and he quickly turns off solitaire.

t3_cl52iu,That's just not cricket.,"I work 2nd line for an MSP supporting a hundred or so companies. Even though we have more than 1,000 client employees reporting to us, there are always some we deal with more than others. This is doubly likely to be the case if they're in-house IT, allowing them to deal with the 1st line issues before it is passed to us. Invariably, this means the tickets those clients pass to us are 10x more complicated...

* IT - In-house IT engineer, damn good filter.

* NE - Network engineer

* Me - ...me

The client in question is very much an email based company. About 3 weeks ago, their external IP address was blacklisted due to a machine sending out hundreds of SMTP requests, meaning they were then unable to send any emails out using their software. Thankfully, my colleague investigated it at this time, and through speaking to both NE and blacklisting company was able to ascertain which machine it was, so was able to run complete virus scans on the machine, cleaning it completely, by which point all SMTP traffic had ceased. This allowed the IP address to be unblocked, and the issue was finished. (Or so he thought...)

This morning, I receive a call from IT saying that the software isn't sending emails. We share a mutual grumble about how unhelpful their software support is (story for another day), and agree that I can reboot the servers in half an hour, giving work time to be save, etc. I schedule the reboot, and ask for a call back if the issues continue. In a shock to literally nobody on here, the issue did continue. In this call, however, I was notified that they not only there was an error, but that this had happened recently when IT was off on holiday, so he was unfamiliar with the resolution. It was at this stage that I learn about the aforementioned ticket, so was able to read into it and see that the exact issue had occurred again.

Armed with this knowledge, I immediately called NE to see what information they could provide about the machine in question, as they manage the network. Unfortunately, the only information they could provide at the time was IP address and MAC address, and that it was on the guest network, though on request they were able to block port 25 for the guest network. I contact IT again, and ask him to pop a laptop onto the guest wi-fi so that I could find more information about the machine, and potentially even the user in question, as no machine matching those details was showing in our software. He then joined me to the guest network but I was unable to find anyone else on it at the time (later found out this was due to disallowing client-client communication on that network), so I took that to mean the machine in question had stopped using the network. Went back to the provider a final time before contacting the blacklist company, only to find out the machine was still on the network. Nonplussed, I did some more scans but was still unable to locate the machine, so I called NE again to see if he could tell me anything else about the machine, this time he was able to tell me that it was being used to stream the cricket. 

From this, I was able to ask IT to do a floorwalk and see if he could find who would be streaming it, though warned him that whomever was doing so wouldn't be able to just exit the stream, we **NEEDED** to get onto their machine to scan it. He back only a few minutes later to say that one user had brought in a personal laptop so that they could stream the cricket in the break room. This made me realise something, and check the dates of the previous outage. The thing in common between the two days? England vs Australia. Clearly a user of good taste, if poor security sense.

IT offered to phone the user (as they had now left the office), and was able to get them to hotspot using their phone, and confirm it was that machine causing the issue. When then asked for my advice for what to do with the laptop, I suggested that if he brought it within a mile of the office again, it could be removed via the window. (Preferably, with the user to follow) 

The only things I'll say in the user's defence is that at least they used the Guest wi-fi, and I've been informed they sounded absolutely horrified when they discovered it was their fault for the 12+ company hours wasted. I have also offered to personally visit the office if he brings it in again, though that could cause more problems...",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cknody,Remote that doesn't work when wife is home,"I was working for a TV distributor with both cable and dish channels. They had their own brand of TV box/decoders.

When the customer in question called in and started by saying that I had to believe him, I knew it was going to be a great call. The log showed he had called several times before.

Customer: When my wife is at home, the remote control to the decoder doesn't work.

Me: Yes, it does, but I'll hear you out.

Inner Me: I bet she takes the batteries.

Customer: Your colleagues all guessed that she takes the batteries..

Inner Me: Darn it.

Customer: ..but she doesn't! I can be holding the remote control and it works fine. She comes home and ten minutes later it doesn't work any more. I haven't let go of the control, and even tried changing batteries when it stopped working just to be sure, but it doesn't make a difference.

We go back and forth for a long time, thinking of different things that could be an issue. He's being nice about my inability to help him, and though I started out thinking he's just another customer who thinks that the reply to ""Did you check if the cable is connected properly?"" is always ""Yes, I did, I even tried five different cables."", even though they didn't, I quickly realise he's tech-savvy and we test and discard a dozen theories.

In the end, 45 minutes later, we solved it. 

When his wife got home, she pulled the curtains apart to let in light, and the sunlight was directly on the IR reciever, interfering with the remote control. When his wife left, he pulled the curtains to see the TV better. They'd tried to lower production cost of the new line of decoders, so the dark plastic in front of the IR reciever was just that - dark plastic instead of a filter to block other light.

Old man: *incoherent noises* phones not working.....*more incoherent noises*... 

Note: the incoherent noises were not disturbances in the call but rather something he did, like rolling around his tounge in his mouth. Giving me an impression he was not 100% healthy from the start. 

Me: Do you have a problem with your phone? Can you give me the number to the affected phone?

He gave me the number and i started to troubleshoot. He was about 56 years old and I didn't find any problems. 

Me: What kind of problem are you experiencing? 

Old man: *incoherent noises*... I.... I can not call.... 

Me: So you cannot make any calls? 

Old man: mmhm... *incoherent noises*

Me: What happens when you try to make a call? 

Old man: pfffffhhhnnnnn iiiiii cant rrRRRrreach mme me me me my b b.... Rother r r r. 

At this point i starter to think that he have had a stroke at some point. 

Me: I understand, so when you're trying to reach your brother what happens then? 

Old man: *incoherent noises*.... Dott... Doottt.. Dot.. It sounds. 

Me: Aha, is it a fast doting sound or slow? 

Old man: ssssssSSS S ll l loow, slow. 

I thought the number he is trying to dial was wrong or something has happened to the number. 

Me: which number has your brother? 

Tge old dude could not say, or i didnt understand at this point. So i asked for his name. 

I got his name and searched him in our system, i found him and tried to make a call. 

Old mans brother: Hello? 

Me: This is OP from \*Company\*, its about old man. 

Old mans brother: Has something happened? 

Me: Well he says he cannot reach you but his phone seems to work. 

Old mans brother: well so what you can about it. 

We talked for a bit and i found out that he indeed have had a stroke and that he is reliant on his phone to be able to call his brother and the hospital. I got back the the old man. 

Me: Hello! Thank you for your patience. I got hold of your brother so his number seems to be working. 

Old man: I i i n n nnnneeed to call m m y brother! 

He sounded distressed all of a sudden. 

Me: I understand, can you just try to call him again, and please repeat the numbers you dial so i can confirm that it is correct. 

Old man: HNNNN m most c c ch call brother!! 

Now he seems very stressed. 

Me: Is it something urgent? Do you need me to call him? 

Old man now shouting: HHHHHOOOSBITAL.... (i heard something hit the floor). 

Me now freaking out: Hello? hello?! Are you there? 
I was thinking what the F? Did he just fall?! A heart attack?!! 

I maxed out the sound on the headset, the call was still ongoing and i could hear a faint breathing.

Me: Hello?! Can you hear me? Are yiu conscious? 
He did not answer... 

I freaking out, a light panic gripped me and i froze like a deer in the headlights. I could not think straight. 
I called his brother because idk, maybe he knew what just happened. (panic)

Me: Hi again this is OP. I was just in a call with your brother and all of a sudden he became stressed out and yelled hospital and then i think he fainted. He seemed to want to cone in contact with you? Do you know what just happened? 

Old mans brother: Oh dear.. I think he just might have had a stroke again, the doctors had warned about this. I cannot check on him im 10 miles away! 

Me freaking out even more: We must get an ambulance! 

Old mans brother: Ofc we do! But i don't know his exact adress! 

Me: i have all of the information infront of me. I can call them. 

So i called the emergency number and asked for an ambulance to the customers adress, they asked me to hold the line with them and the old man if i heard him stop breathing and keep trying to contact him. 

The police and ambulance came to the customers door and tried to open the door after failed communication attempts. 10 minutes after i called the emergency number the old dudes breath became irregular and weaker, i told them that and the freaking firemen came and broke down hus door with heavy duty equipment!! 

I heard how they found him and tried to talk to him, and how they moved him around. 
I heard them saying that they have to take him to the emergency room at the hospital and brought a stretcher to lay him down on and carry him to the ambulance. 

I just sat there on my butt like :O the whole time untill the woman from the emergency number told me that we could hang up. 

After that i called the brother and told him what had happened. He was very upset and i heard his voice crack a little bit. He told me to call him tomorrow and we hung up. 

I had no freaking idea what to do. Am i in trouble? i thought. I told like EVERYONE at the office what happened and all of them encouraged me to contact the brother the day after. Which i then did. 

I was nervous and kinda scared when i called. I didn't know how to act because i was not in a situation i had traning for or had ever experienced. 

The brother picked up and immediately shined up in the voice when i introduced me. 

He said that he could not thank me enough for what i did. And that i probably saved his brothers life. 
He actually had a stroke!! He went unconscious and hit his head on the livingroom table in the fall. Luckily it caused minor damage, and his brother had woken up and was alive.
He told me that he would personally call my boss to have a talk with her and tell her to give me a raise, lol. 
I was completely humbled during the entire length of the call, i could barely utter words.

I didn't get the raise but... i got my face printed out and put up in the cafeteria with the text ""Super supporten som räddar liv"" Which means the ""The super supporter that saves lives"". And i fine with that... I barely wanted to think about if he didn't survive, or if i passed him off like a wierdo and hung up! Just to let him lay there and die... 


Nothing like this has ever happened to anyone i know, even after 6 years in the tech support. I don't know if i was unlucky or that it was luck. 

Please tell me if you have had a similar experience some time :)

t3_ckst8n,The Best Dam engineer,"I think that this tale needs re-telling due to the timeliness of this news story, and apologies for not having any I.T. angle.
https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ckoyy3/town_evacuated_as_dam_wall_collapses/

Disclaimer: It was a former colleague at a previous employer that is the hero of this tale. And the details were pieced together from office conversations and trade press.

Approximately a decade ago there was a similar earth dam that was at imminent risk of overflowing / collapsing due to excessive rainfall, threatening to wipe out an entire town downstream.

$hero was driving to a different dam to perform a routine examination a few hours away (a normal day for him), when he received a panicked phonecall from the onsite dam manager saying that due to the rain the water levels were too high and the spillway was taking the excess water away, but the flow of excess water was such that it was eroding away the spillway.

For those that are not familiar, spillways look like giant versions of children’s playground slides and they are built (usually of concrete) into dams slightly lower than the level of the tops of the dams, and act exactly the same a your sink overflow mechanisms at home, just a million times larger. And can cope with a certain flow of water, but if that flow is exceeded then the spillway will erode away, and will continue to erode away through the body of the dam.

$hero on hearing the news turned his car around rapidly, (I don’t know if the car tyres actually squeeled, but imagine that they did for dramatic effect), and started heading for the failing dam as fast as the wet road would allow (rain flooding the dam remember).

$hero kept pulling over the the side of the road on his journey to $failing-dam to make and receive phonecalls. The calls were to 
1/ reschedule the routine exam, 
2/ assess the condition of the failing dam, 
3/ start the de-watering of the dam to reduce the pressures and minimise the chances of complete failure, and 
4/ marshal the first responders to evacuate the town below (including the setting up of a temporary evacuee centre / commandeer a community hall).

On the way to the failing dam, $hero heard on the local radio news with the local police chief giving an interview, where the reported actually used the pun “the best dam engineer/ best damn engineer”.

By the time $hero reached the police cordon around the control room / crisis command centre, the locally available pumps were already working and more lorries with additional pumps were on their way, the evacuation of the town was in progress, and barriers to control large quantities of spilt water if the dam were to catastrophically fail were being erected.

When $hero reached the police cordon he was stopped and was denied entry by the officer manning the gate, so $hero calmly phoned the most senior police commander in his phone’s address book (who he had been speaking to a few minutes earlier) and handed his phone to the officer on the gate. It was later said that the profanities from the police commander could be heard from 20 meters from the handset.

The officer on the gate let $hero through as quickly as he could and $hero ran into the control centre, where he was greeted with a standing ovation from the assembled first responders, local government types and dam owners, as he had (without fully realising it) instructed / explained all the necessary steps to deliver, setup and anchor the pumps.

Then as an anticlimax the dam was dewatered, and so saved then over the next few months was repaired and put back into operation.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ckuk1n,Can I please get my data back?,"This happened to a friend, a senior manager at a state agency.

Her: Yes, we can get on but it hasn't worked in a month.

t3_ckpph4,"The 3 Week Saga of the Broken Wifi, and a Hero Named Jeff"," First time poster, long time lurker. I do not work in IT but I wanted to share a story of one of my IT problems as a token of my appreciation for all you fine folks do. I don't claim to be tech savvy or knowledgeable about this field in any way so if any of you think me stupid, I agree. Also I$P was literally my only option for internet if anyone is wondering. 

My story starts in late 2011. I had just moved to Houston after taking a new job and was anxious to get my apartment ready. Shortly after getting my Internet installed I started having trouble connecting any of my devices to the wifi so I called I$P support. What followed was three solid weeks of calls to resolve the problem and after a couple hours on the phone, being told that there is clearly not a problem on their end.

I had techs from I$P come out twice only to tell me there wasn't a problem, though when one of them couldn't connect his own device to the wifi, he said, ""Huh, that should be working"", and left shortly thereafter. All together I, conservatively, spent about 20-30 hours trying to fix this problem over the course of 3-4 weeks.

Then, after reaching my breaking point I took two days off work just so I could have an unlimited amount of time to spend on the phone with support trying to fix this. I called I$P with the number I had by then memorized, and told the tech support person that answered that my problem was beyond their capabilities and I needed to be passed on to next level. You can imagine how that went over. After going through the same troubleshooting issues I had done dozens of times, she said, ""I'm sorry I'm unable to help you, let me pass you on to someone who might have a better idea of the problem.""

No shit.

Next comes our level two guy, we'll call him Sparticus. Sparticus actually does a few new things with me that the other dozen or so level two guys haven't. We go into the back end, change a whole bunch of stuff that I don't recognize, and my wireless begins to trickle to life. It is by no means working, but my devices recognize that there is in fact a router somewhere. Sparticus and I work till about 11am and then, exasperated and defeated, he says, ""Look Muckman, I've tried everything I know and I'm really frustrated, so I'm passing you on to a specialist.""

I knew I was in good hands when, instead of a ""This is Blahblah at I$P tech support, etc"", I hear, ""This is Jeff."" I quickly go over what's been happening over the last month and he joins me in my nearly irate state. He says that he's going to stay with me until we get this resolved. I like Jeff. We start going through things I don't comprehend and giving him access to my computer and such. Jeff starts to get frustrated. About an hour into the call he starts asking me really random questions. ""You're googling this aren't you"", I ask. He replies, ""This is mostly what we do to fix things that don't make any damn sense"". I like Jeff.

Around hour 2 or 3 we've reached a level where we're both comfortable with him working in total silence, occasionally telling me to change or try something. We even took a short break and ate lunch together. Suddenly, around hour 4, he asks, ""Do... do you by chance have the brand new wireless gaming headset from Brand X?"" I do in fact have this wireless gaming headset, this is something I have mentioned to a several people over the course of the month but never raised any flags. ""Unplug it. Don't turn it off, don't disconnect it, remove power chord from the wall.""

I'll be damned if my internet didn't surge to life right then. At this point I'm feeling a strange mix of relief and frustration at both myself and everyone I had talked to for not having solved this seemingly simply problem earlier. He mentioned that he's heard of interference coming from them but never directly cancelling out the signal. He seems excited to log this into the system as as possible problem since apparently no one has ever encountered this before. We say our goodbyes and he comps me 6 months of internet for my troubles. Wherever you are Jeff, you are a hero.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ckpliy,"I'd like to sign up for the childbirth classes, please","It was my day off, and I was busy wrestling the engine out of my riding mower when my phone rang. 

&gt;Me: Hello? 

&gt;Caller: Hi, I’m calling to rent a breast pump

&gt;Me: Uhh, I think you have the wrong number

&gt;Caller: Sorry *click*

WTF I thought, that’s a pretty strange wrong number. I didn’t think anything of it and carried on disassembling the mower. 

A few minutes later, my hands are nice and greasy again when the phone rings. It’s $Hospital. I wipe my hands and answer it.

&gt;Me: Hello? 

&gt;Caller: Hi, I’m calling to sign up for the breastfeeding classes

&gt;Me: Uhh, I think you have the wrong number

&gt;Caller: Sorry to have bothered you *click*

Two calls in a row? I’m willing to bet it wasn’t a coincidence. I was tempted to message our phone guy and ask him to have a look, but before I got the chance, the phone rang again.

&gt;Me: Hello? 

&gt;Caller: Hi, I’m calling to sign up for the childbirth classes

&gt;Me: Uhh, I think you have the wrong number

&gt;Caller: Oh, sorry *click*

Then, I realized, hey dummy, this has happened before. I caught my phone number on the $PhysicalTherapy phones before, and strangely enough, got overflow calls from the switchboard routed to my cell phone once or twice. No coincidence here, there is a ghost in the machine.

**Message time!**


&gt;Me: Hey @phoneGuy I keep getting phone calls meant for OBGYN. Can you search the PBX for my 
cell phone number?

&gt;PG: Can’t, busy racking the new switches and patching stuff in

Fair enough, we’ve been stupid busy. I was just relieved that none of these calls was my boss calling me in for more overtime. 


A while later, I’m almost ready to start my repaired Franken-mower when $Hospital calls again. 

&gt;Me: Hello? 

&gt;Original Caller: Hi, I’m calling to rent a breast pump

&gt;Me: Uhh, I think you have the wrong number again

&gt;OC: Oh Sorry *click*

So I message again

&gt;Me: @Phoneguy, @contractorX, I keep getting wrong number calls from the hospital. Plz out my phone number from the PBX. Someone has a callfwd on.

&gt;PG: Too busy, my dude

&gt;Cx: *crickets*


I’m a little steamed. PhoneGuy is busy and Cx is MIA. I called Cx but didn’t get an answer.

After another wrong number, I grabbed my phone, went to contacts, tapped **Hospital** and checked ‘Send all calls to voicemail’

Minutes later, I get a call from $ContractorX.

&gt;Cx: Hey Bacon, any idea why people can’t get through to the breastfeeding line?

&gt;Me: Oh, that’s why I’ve been getting those strange calls. I’ve been telling $phoneGuy my phone number is in the PBX somewhere. I forgot that has happened before

&gt;Cx: Oh so he’s already aware? Thanks, I’ll give him a call.


Next thing I know, it was fixed, and it never happened again. Was definitely worth a laugh on my day off.	


PS: Many months later, we were searching the PBX and discovered something. Turns out that $PG was using a helpdesk phone as a template, so all of the new phones had my cell number as the default call forward. You better believe I yeeted that out of the PBX with the force of a thousand suns.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ckp5r0,Supporting the techs,"This is another story from my time with the cable company in California.

Occasionally, the company would perform audits of apartment complexes.  The tech assigned the audit would go building-to-building, verifying that people were connected to the services they were paying for (or disconnected if they weren't paying).  Every tech at the company performed audits from time-to-time.  As a backup tech, sometimes I would be sent to remote areas that received few work orders (trailer parks, condos).

Often, we would find someone hadn't been disconnected on their disconnect work order (lazy tech didn't do it, or disconnected the wrong person who got reconnected on a later work order, that sort of thing. Then, there were the thieves.  Bobbie (Roberta) had found such a thief.

Catching cable thieves is hard to do.  You must catch them in the act or they will get away with it.  At the time, we would just disconnect them and move on.  Beyond a sticker on the (locked) service box explaining that it was a crime, it wasn't worth any further effort.  This story is about a time when extra effort was made.

She came into dispatch fuming about someone she had disconnected in an audit a month ago, and today when she was in that same service closet - the guy was connected again.  I looked up the unit and confirmed, no service. Bobby had an idea to fix this guy.  The next day, she went back to that complex and cut his cable back to 3 inches of the wall where it emerged.  Not enough cable to reach the service panel, and just enough cable that we could splice onto it if we needed to.  She was satisfied that he was finally cut off for good.

A few days later, Bobbie fumes into dispatch again ""HE HOOKED HIMSELF BACK UP AGAIN!"".  I said, ""how? you cut his cable"".  The guy had used trash bag twistie ties to build a makeshift cable to the service panel.  He stripped the paper from the ends, tied them together end-to-end making 2 conductors, stripped back his stubby cable and tied himself back in. This guy wasn't taking no for an answer.

She had returned late that night, and it was almost time for me to be off work.  I suggested ""do you want to hang out in the service closet and catch him in the act?"" She wasn't sure if it would work, we didn't even know if the guy was home - but she was game for it.

So we grabbed a 6 pack of beer, went to the apartment complex, ripped out the trash-tie-wiring, and sat down on the floor of the service closet cracking jokes and drinking beers in the dark.

It didn't take long at all.  The closet door swings open and a guy steps inside with a flashlight and a screwdriver prying at the door of the service box.  Bobbie and I turned on our flashlights, spotlighting the guy, and I said ""It's a $10,000 fine for stealing cable"".  The guy nearly jumped out of his skin, he turned to us - caught...hand in the cookie jar.

Bobbie said to him, ""It's $12 a month. Just order service and stop messing up our equipment and we'll forget we saw you doing this."" I can't say for certain, but I think he ran back to his apartment.

I don't recall if he ordered service after that, but we didn't have a problem with him again.",talesfromtechsupport

I show up with my binder of certificates and request that my 201 file be updated to reflect the continuing education I've completed. The personnel SGT looked at it and said "" no way, I'm not adding this in, it's too much work"". Ooook... I walk out without a word, knowing this will be coming back to haunt G1 yet again.

t3_ckdttn,How DARE you give me free cancer?!,"Hello! So this is my very first story i have ever posted here and if i have done anything wrong in the storytelling please let me know. :)

&amp;#x200B;

I have been working in IT customer service for some years now and I have had my fair share of crazy and stupid people.

&amp;#x200B;

This story is from a couple of years ago in 2014.I was working for my country's biggest ISP as a customer tech supporter, i was mainly helping people with wired internet. Fiber optics and copper cable aswell as home phones and TV.

The company gives a free router to almost all our internet customers that even has a thunder warranty.Before the company had that deal the customers got a simple modem. This will become important later.

&amp;#x200B;

So i was there answering the phone to one lady late at a friday night about 18:30 o'clock.

Me: Hello! My name is OP how can i help you?

Lady: About time! do you know how long i have been in queue? why is the queue so long? don't you have enough staff or are you all just lazy? (She was one of those, i did a mental sighs and mustered my regular nice service voice)

Note: She had this VERY obnoxious tone in her voice and we very rude.

Me: I apologize about the queue time, there has been a major disturbance at a station so alot of people are calling in at the moment. But how may i....(i was interrupted)

Lady: I don't care about your excuses! My internet is incredibly slow and my phone has this annoying scraping sound in it! it has been this way since 3 months ago!! Why havent you done anything about it?!

Me: I understand, i am sorry that you have experienced a slow internet connection for some time but its important to let us know about that sooner so we can help you. Let me just run a few analytics. (The analisys showed a diversion in the cable, a problem that commonly is caused by units connected home at the customer). I proceeded to tell her: The analytics show me a problem that causes your experienced problem, i need to run a few tests to find exactly where this problem is.

Lady: ""She huffs"". Well okay i can wait but make it quick, i don't have all day! and staying in a call like this makes me feel sick! (Me thinking: Wait.. sick?)

Me: How nice of you to help, together we can locate and fix the problem i am sure of it. I need you to pull out all of your units from the internet sockets so i can run the same analisys again to see if i get a different result. But before we do that i need to borrow you mobile phone number so i we can proceed the call from there.

Reluctantly and ranting under her breath she gave me her number and we proceeded the call over the MB.She pulled out all the stuff and the troubleshooting showed that her old modem was the cause of the problem.I explained to her that she needed a new one and that its no longer in stock because at the time that modem was over 7 years old.

Lady: What do you mean its not in stock?! i want a new one now!

Me: It means that the modem has expired from our stock, it is no longer avalible, but we have another free product that we can give to you in its stead.

Lady: Mhm fine, i sure hope you can send it to me so i have it by tomorrow.

Me: I am afraid that sending this new product to you in such a short notice is impossible due of how the postal service operates. But it will come to the nearest postal service location within 2-3 workdays!

Well now she became out of nowhere really mad.She proceeded to loudly yell at me.

Lady: NO you will send it to me, to MY mailbox by tomorrow NOT to the postal service office!! I don't care how you do it and i expect not to having to pay anything! this is the least thing you can do for me after making we having to endure such a bad internet connection for 3 months and having me call you and wait in a queue for 30 minutes then do YOUR work so we can find the problem! You WILL make what's nessessary so that i can have it by tomorrow.

At this point getting quite upset having her attitude showed in my ear for now about 20 minutes and now she starts screaming at the person helping her?

Me really trying to sound nice: Miss, as i said, that is impossible, and we cannot know if your internet is behaving if we never get a notice from you who uses the internet, i can send... (interrupted again)

Lady: I said i don't CARE how you make it work!!! JUST MAKE IT WORK!

Me: That. is. impossible, i would send it to your mailbox so you would get it by tomorrow if i could. You live approximatly 400km from our storage facility, where the product is sent from and its friday 19 (something) o'clock now. You can expect your package to the nearest postal service location next tuesday or wednesday.

Lady: WHAT?! So i will have to wait 4-5 days for it?! This is the worse service ever! \*Company\* has SUCH a bad customer service!!! (\*Company\* actuarly has the country's best customer service and best waittime for issue resolvement)

Me at the moment had enough of her banchee screetching: Yes. You will have to wait for the package to be delivered.

Lady: Ugh... (Went silent for about 5s) I guess we will get nowhere with that..

lady, somehow now calm?: What exactly is this new product?

Me, quite confused by her complete 180: Eugh... its a router that \*company\* gives away for free to all out internet customers as a free rental product.

Lady, again screaming but now completely livid: WHAT?! you're sending ME a router?!HOW DARE YOU?! Don't you know how dangerus those things are?!! i am ALLERGIC TO RADIO SIGNALS!!!

Me quite stunned by the next 720 turn in the conversation again: Eh.. Well if you're feeling unconftible with the wifi running, i can turn it of for you.

Lady, even more angry... how that by this point is even possible: YOU, Y-YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER MY ROUTER?!!!

Me: Well technically its not your router, you borrow it during the time you have inter... (interrupted)

Lady: THOSE THINGS ARE DANGERUS AND DEADLY, how can \*Company\* send out those things FOR FREE when you KNOW how dangerus they are?! do you WANT people to get CANCER?!!!

Me: Lady... i assure you that our router meets the european standard wifi regulation.(Silence except for breathing).

Me: The wifi signal emitted by thi... (interrupted)

Lady: WIFI IS CANCER and cause all manners of sickness! young boy, i am educated and I know ALLOT more than you about these things, i have been reachearching this.

Me, now quite fed up with her BS and no longer gives one F: Oh, if you have knowlage about this? then you should know that the radio signal emitted by our router is at standard 2.4Ghz and that radiosignal is non ionizing. Meaning that the radiosignal does not carry enough energy to excite the electrons in the molecules that builds your DNA enough be flung away from the molecule and damage your DNA structure to cause cellular damage. This signal cannot cause cancer.

Lady: YOU LIE! (She did not try to correct me) And i want you NOT to send me that POISONBOX!you will have to send me a modem instead!

Me: I'm afraid i can't do that.What i just offered you for free as a sulotion to your problem is what we hand out. IF you do not want it, you can feel free to buy your own product from anywhere. Just note that if you do \*Company\* has no support over the product you have bought outside our company as a sulotion not provided by the ISP to a problem that could have been fixed with \*company\* products.

Lady: So you are now FORCING me to BUY a product at another \*company\* to have my internet work?!

Me: Noone is forcing you, you could have our router for free and let me turn of the wifi. but you denied it and want a product that is no longer avalible.

Lady: I will make you the headline of the newspaper, i will report you to the polise for fraud and have you fired!! You are giving away CANCER FOR FREE!  WHAT. IS. YOUR. NAME?! (I gave her my name at the start of the call, but i guess she forgot)

Me: I do not feel comfortable telling you my name. but you can call be Robert (Far from my actual name)

Lady: Do the people at \*Company\* know who ""Robert"" is?

Me: No.

Lady: Wh... what?! WHAT?!

Me: If you want us to send you the free product to solve your problem, feel free to call us again.

Lady: NO I..(Klick)

I think the call duration was about 45 minutes in total and during the time she allways complained about something, it was me, the company, the service, our methods of work and our systems.

After the call i told my boss what have happened and she was supportive and told me that i should have hung up sooner than i did and was proud of me for trying to help that nasty customer. She told me that she have overheard some of it and that i did it good.

t3_ckc3wy,"Yes, It's turned on... Tale of the broken POS cash register system...","CB = Me, Codebooker, Private Tech Guy Who Does IT Work

RE = Sam (not her real name), the Restaurant Employee, a 30-something-year-old woman who has worked at this restaurant for many years

Backstory: I had replaced the cash register system at a restaurant because the old one died unexpectedly and was very old and in need of replacement. Moved the POS software over to a Dell XE2, and got them a new Elo touchscreen monitor that was bigger and brighter than their old one. They were very pleased with this as it was faster and the big screen was nicer. A day after the install I got a call from the restaurant’s cashier/bartender who handled when customers came in to eat and when they were ready to pay, so she was the sole user of this POS system during business hours. The restaurant’s owner would get on the POS system after hours every day to get sales totals, keep note of this, it’ll be important later. What happened next went like this…

&amp;#x200B;

Cellphone: RINNNNNNG

CB: Hey, thanks for calling -*business name here-* this is Codebooker, how can I help you?

RE: Hey Codebooker, It’s Sam at -*restaurant name-* I’m having a problem.

CB: Okay, what seems to be the issue?

RE: The new cash register system you setup, it isn’t working.

CB: What do you mean it isn’t working? Like specifically what is it doing?

RE: The screen is black and when I tap it, nothing happens.

CB: Okay, are there any lights on the screen?

RE: Yes, a green light in the bottom right corner, it’s flashing on and off.

CB: Okay, that sounds like the PC isn’t on, can you look under the counter for me and tell me if the PC has a green light on it that is lit up?

RE: Yes, it does, the light is solid on (note that the XE2 is turned around backwards so the PSU’s green light faces you when you look under the counter, it allows easier access to the cables)

CB: Have you tried pressing the power button on the back side of the computer, it’s a large square button in the top corner.

RE: Yes, and nothing happened.

CB: And it isn’t doing anything when you move the mouse or tap on the keyboard?

RE: No, nothing.

CB: Are all the cables connected? There shouldn’t be any disconnected plugs under there.

RE: Yep, everything is hooked up. I don’t know what to do, can you just come out here? I have customers starting to come in and I’ll be needing the system to cash them out when they leave.

CB: Sure, I’ll head over as soon as I can.

Cellphone: CLICK, end of call

&amp;#x200B;

So, I dropped what I was working on and hopped in the car and rode 20 minutes over there. I walked in the door of the restaurant and headed behind the counter and as soon as I was behind the counter I noticed that the XE2 was not indeed on, and the PSU light was not lit up. I pressed the power button and the system sprang to life. After about 20 seconds it was booted into Windows and was sitting at the logon screen for the POS software. Then Sam walked over to where I was.

&amp;#x200B;

RE: Great, you fixed it, and that was really fast too. What was the problem?

CB: It was off, all I did was press the power button (motioning to the power button’s location).

RE: Oh, geez, I feel so stupid.

CB: It’s all good, it’s working now, but why was it off? I thought you guys left it on 24/7.

RE: Yeah, we were, I’m not sure.

CB: You mind if I take a look?

RE: No, go ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I looked at the Windows Event Logs and saw where it was shutdown properly right around the time that the owner checks each day’s sales totals. He must have turned it off after he got the totals. So I rebooted the PC into the BIOS and set it to auto-boot 30 minutes before they open each day, then I left and drove back to what I was working on before the call. I haven’t had an issue with them since…

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Restaurant employee couldn’t figure out why POS system wasn’t working… It was just turned off…",talesfromtechsupport

t3_ck7vip,The Adventures of Dr. Awesome,"A more lighthearted tale from healthcare IT.

One day, I got called up to med/surg to help Dr. Awesome.  Dr. Awesome was an ex-Army combat surgeon with multiple tours in Iraqistan under his belt. He was always laid back, amazing under pressure, and well respected by everyone. I don’t think I ever saw him raise his voice to anyone and he was always very courteous with his patients. In short, the dude was awesome.

Seems he was having trouble viewing his charts. No big deal, just have to reinstall the ActiveX control. Five minute job, easy.

I go up there and say hello. As I’m sitting in front of the PC clicking away, he pipes up.

&gt;Awesome: I know it’s not your fault, but this EMR is a real piece of sh!t man. We’re always having problems.

&gt;Me: ….   

&gt;Awesome: It’s like we bought the $500 car of EMR’s. You know how $500 cars are?

&gt;Me: LOL yeah

&gt;Awesome: You buy a $500 car, it breaks down the next day, and you sink all of your paychecks into it until it’s all sorted, but at the end of the day, you still have a hooptie and you can never rely on it.


I’m just nodding and smiling as enthusiastically as I can. Best summary of our situation I’ve ever heard, and as the owner of a lot of $500 cars, I can vouch for that part too.


&gt;Awesome: And I’ve always wondered...who got a kickback on this deal? We could have easily gotten  different software


My jaw is on the floor. I’m probably not supposed to agree, but he’s right, you know.

But he’s not done yet...

**Cut to a few days later**


Dr. Awesome stops by the HD. Seems his laptop needs some help – he’s been having trouble charting from home and can’t figure out why. He said he’d gladly stick around while I worked on it, so I set him up in the cubicle next to mine and got to work.

It was an easy fix – just update his VPN client and reinstall that pesky ActiveX control. I’m tapping away when the phone rings. I look over and it’s my boss, ContractorX.


&gt;Awesome: Hey man, I can answer that if you want

&gt;Me: …. sure, but put it on speaker 

&gt;Awesome: Thank you for calling IT, this is Dr. Awesome, how can I help you?

&gt;Cx: Uhhhh….what? Hi Awesome. This is Cx. Did I call the wrong number?

&gt;Awesome: Nah, this is the helpdesk. What can we do for you?

&gt;Cx: Oh. Uh. Can I speak to Bacon?

I piped up and answered his question and he hung up, sounding more than a little confused.


I was still working on Dr. Awesome’s laptop when ContractorX walked in. He saw Awesome sitting next to me and blinked hard. I guess we really threw him for a loop. Maybe he thought he imagined it.


&gt;Cx: Dr. Awesome, nice to see you. You guys really had me going. ROFL.

&gt;Awesome: Yeah, I always wanted to do that


I laughed, Dr. Awesome laughed, ContractorX laughed, the refrigerator laughed, I shot the fridge. All was well.

t3_ck7uu9,Vendor support is the best,"First time posting here but thought you might like this one:  

Edited: definitions at the bottom of the post, it would break the flow to explain it in the story.

So I am essentially tier 3 support at a managed service provider, anything from on site discovery to rebuilding networks is in my scope.  
Yesterday one of our clients submitted a ticket stating their SAN had some ""blinky lights on it""

 Before going further it should be noted that we inherited this system from their on site IT support before they opted to use a MSP for IT, so alot of the design was out of our control.

 One of our support techs informs the client of their support contract for the SAN and to request some replacement drives (we verified that all of their VMs were online and that no ESX datastores were offline).

 Several hours later our monitoring platform alerts us that one of the clients VMs has gone offline.  It just so happens to be their file server, so they are appropriately concerned.  We look at the SAN (fwiw this SAN is VMWare aware, so it hooks directly to ESX and is aware of its datastores) and see that the file server datastore is inactive and critical.  Do some digging and discover that the datastore is essentially like 12 drives in....raid5.  There are 2 hot spare drives on the system, but from the logs it looks like the hot spare was correctly engaged, but the datastore still shows offline, even though only 1 drive has failed.  

At this point our familiarity with this particular brand of SAN is fairly limited and they have a support contract, so we decide to engage their support.  At the same time because we have been doing this awhile, we decide I should drive over a 15tb QNAP and get it on their network and begin restoring the file server from backup, this way if vendor support cant bring the datastore back online, we at least have a plan b.  

So I get the QNAP installed on site, configure an iscsi target and iscsi lun on the device, then configure the ESX cluster to see the iscsi lun as a datastore, point the backup software at the lun and kick it off.  

The time is now 9:30pm and we figure the restore is going to take around 15 hours (the file server is not all that big, just over 2tb, but the SANs iops (input/output operations per second) are being crushed by array rebuilding and whatever else vendor support is doing, plus the backup data lives on the same SAN because I'm sure budget constraints lead them to believe that was OK.  Couple that with a single 1gb nic on the QNAP and you can see there are alot of throttles).  

Cut to 2:30AM and vendor support is still working on the issue, they had completed their ""Equalization"" process and were attempting to bring the datastore back online when they decided ""hey, we need to **turn off iscsi on the LUN**....  

Up to this point they had been remotely connected to, of all servers, the backup server (which inherently isn't the issue here), and as soon as they issued the command, the backup vm died.....which also killed their connection to the SAN.  Turns out the LUN that the file server lives on also houses the entire...backup...array...  

It is, at the time of writing this, 6:20 am and the sitrep is that an entire LUN is offline, 3 core servers are dead, restores are impossible to perform, and vendor support is, and I kid you not here, typing commands that aren't real into the cli for the SAN multiple times hoping that maybe the second time they issue the exact same command it will work... 

root@(none) spb:\~&gt; server\_mount all

\-bash: server\_mount: command not found

root@(none) spb:\~&gt; server\_mount all

\-bash: server\_mount: command not found

Maybe third time will be the charm there guys...

tl;dr Vendors are idiots and always put your backup data on a different SAN, or at least it's own LUN.



Definitions:

VMWare Esx - hypervisor platform for hosting virtual machines

Datastore - ESX logical data storage for virtual machines

SAN - Storage Area Network, basically a large array of disk drives allocated into disk groups to allow for shared storage on servers.

Raid5 - redundant array of independent disks, just a logical structure of drives where, in a group of drives, 1 could fail without dataloss.

Hotspare - like it sounds, a drive in the SAN that can take over for a drive that fails.  Hot meaning the system remains on and spare being spare.

QNAP - brand of network attached storage, just a device with drives

Iscsi - internet small computer interface, think of it as a digital cable to connect virtual or physical devices to each other over the network

Lun - logical unit number, essentially the volume of data contained inside a disk group on a san",talesfromtechsupport

t3_cjwpqi,My passwords are gone and it's your fault!,"I'm a developer at a mid-range BPO company. I recently made an in-house password management application because our phone agents can't remember their logins. It's particularly bad in our line of work, because a forgotten login can keep them from being productive for 30 to 60 minutes while it's reset. Before this they were storing their passwords in text files, but due to a company wide mandate all of our agents had their access to any kind of text editor removed. Naturally, I field basic support questions for the application since I'm the only one with any real familiarity with how it works.

I got an email a week ago from a manager (Mgr) absolutely livid with me and the application. He has an agent who claims their passwords are just gone. This is how the conversation proceeded:

Me: Okay, give me some quick reproduction steps. I need to know what the agent did.

Mgr: He just had them one day and the next they were gone. You need to fix this right now. They're not being productive and it's your fault!

Me: That doesn't explain anything, I need step by step what he did.

Mgr: He says they were there last night when he left, and when he came in today, they were gone. I checked, there is nothing in the application.

(Repeat this same loop 4 times)

After that fruitless conversation, I tell him to have the agent re-enter the passwords he can remember. At the same time, I use our remote monitoring software to watch his screen. The manager comes back 10 minutes later.

Mgr: They're in there now.

Me: No they aren't.

Mgr: Yes they are, I saw him typing.

Me: Well I watched the screen. He didn't even open the application. I've got the video if you wanna see it.

I play back the recording. Mgr watches, eyes wide, as the agent moves the cursor around for a few moments, and then the highlighted icon on the desktop shifts around, indicating that they're typing on the desktop. Pretty sure I got the guy fired. I did eventually get an apology from Mgr over the ordeal. The application is used by 1500 people on a daily basis and has been for months... so an odd out of the blue catastrophic failure is beyond suspicious. As best I can tell, the guy wasn't using the system at all, and when he got caught (probably by forgetting a password), he panicked and said my application was at fault.

EDIT: Quick update, While it's clearly easily possible to defeat the mechanisms in place, I had no hand in how they went about banning text editors. The general idea is to make it difficult for the vast majority of people, and catch those few who are smart enough to pull it off. Anyone who knows enough to bypass the restrictions, isn't likely to hang around in a job that pays $10 an hour.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cjyc8t,We just throw it in the trash,"So where I work we got a 4 floor building with several multifunctional printer/scanners spread out over the building, I think a dozen in total. When their inkt cartridges run out or the waste toner gets full, we get a mail message to warn users and us about it. Most of the time we place cartridges and waste toners in cupboards near the multifunctional printers so users can change it for themselves (being a 24/7 workplace and all). The printers auto-order new stock as needed.

Recently we noticed empty waste toners piling up in our supply so we figured that we had been overlooking the need to place them in the building. Shortly afterwards we get a notification mail that a waste toner was almost full and would soon require changing. One of our IT-team members goes out with a new waste toner to the multifunctional printer. He goes to the menu of the printer to check how much waste is in the waste toner.

0% full. No waste was present in the toner. He figures that that is strange and figures he will need to check notification settings on the printer. Before leaving he tells people that he will place the new empty waste toners near the printer. He opens up the cupboard and sees a pile of waste toners laying there unopened. He goes to ask the people what they do when a waste toner is full.

""Oh, we just dump the waste in the trash bin.""

The highly flammable and cancereous waste....is just dumped....in the trash bin. Apparantly they found a way to open the waste toner (normally for safety reasons it only opens when inserted into the printer) and used it to dump it in a trash bi We are very glad we don't have any users that require us holding their hands through everything, but this might just be a bit too much of the ""we'll figure it out ourselves""-mentality.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_cjntl5,Sort of a side gig,"I got my start in support in the pre-personal-computer era while working for a cable company in Southern California.  We had a few actual computers, but mostly there were dumb terminals on a token ring network.  I was supporting the in-house PCs (80286@16MHz), but my main responsibilities were as backup to everyone.  I was trained to do everything, so when someone called in sick - I was the fill-in guy.  If an installer called in sick, I knew how to do installs.  If the dispatcher called in sick, I dispatched.  My normal schedule put me in the office at 11AM and I was there until closing.

As the closer, I had all the keys, and all the codes for the alarms.  I also took the last two hours of support calls before shutting down the phones.  That meant I got calls from every person who forgot they had an installation appointment and was pissed that they had to wait 3 or 4 days for the next available install slot.

Then one night, I got THAT call...the one that opened my eyes to the possibilities of the power I held in my pocket (the keys to everything).

The customer called in a near panic. He just moved into his apartment, invited all of his buddies over to watch ""the big game"", and while he was busy taking care of the minutia in preparation for his party - he forgot to be home for the cable guy.

What opened my eyes was something he said.  ""Don't you have someone who lives in the area who can come and install this?  I can pay him! What will it take?""  It was then that I realized - I live in that area....and I'm going to be off work in 15 minutes....and I have access to all of the equipment I need...it's in the warehouse....I won't even be taking anything out of a service vehicle...this is all the extra stuff.  I can take the paperwork, fill it out like a normal install, and put it into the system tomorrow when I get to work......nobody will know...it will just magically be completed.

This customer had awakened my inner schemer.  I told him that I'd get in touch with a tech that lived in the area and see if he was available.  The guy said ""tell him I'll pay him $50 if he can come right now"".  So I put him on hold for about 5 minutes, and when I came back I said ""The tech can be there in 30 minutes (about how long it was going to take me to get there after locking up the shop).

Not only did everything go as planned.  The customer got his install, I got $50, but I also had a couple of beers and pieces of pizza when the install was complete (it was a party after all).

That became a regular gig for me.  I would lay out all of the local missed installs in the dispatch office after everyone else left for the day and wait for someone who was desperate for an immediate install and quietly suggest that there was a tech who lived in the area who might be willing to make a late night call.  Eventually it expanded to people who were non-pay disconnects.  Someone would forget to pay and wanted a reconnect after-hours.....I'd take their check and an extra $whatever-they-offered to take care of it.

For a 19 year old kid, making an average extra $200 per week under the table in the early 90's was awesome.  Some weeks I made more in after-hours service than I did in my regular paycheck.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cjg0ta,De-overwrite my file!,"Today we have a delightful story of an intrepid IT support manager (me), a clueless client (client), and an unfortunate desk.

For context, this client has individual workstations all synced up to a cloud server, but they sometimes store stuff on their desktop (macbooks) which ISN'T synced, and not backed up (and they know this)

 

Me: (Going about the humdrum of the day)  
Client: OMG HELP I DELETEZ FILE FROM DESKTOP AND EMPTY TRASH BIN HELP HELP  
Me: How long ago did you delete this file?  
Client: 10 days ago!!  I need it back!  
Me: 10 days?  Well, in that case I can almost guarantee it's not recoverable.  
Client: But this file is IMPOOOOOORTANT!  
Me: Sorry, we can try scanning your computer for the file, but chances are it's been overwritten.  
Client: Then de-overwrite it!

Me: De-overwrite it?  I'm sorry, but that's not possible.

Client: But it works that way with my ipod!  I can delete a song and then download a new one, then download the old one again!

Me: ......................................... *Head smashes into desk...poor desk.*

Me: Ma'am...that's different.  You're downloading the song to your iPod, yes, but that is just downloading the song from the iTunes servers.

Client: Then download my file from the iTunes servers!

Me: Ma'am, unless the file is a movie, song or an app, that doesn't work.

Client: THEN MAKE IT WORK!  I NEED THAT FILE FOR A VERY IMPORTANT MEETING!

I launched a file recovery program we keep, and started the scan.  Two minutes later, the client was nagging at me to ""hurry up and just recover the file.  It's not that difficult!"".  Five minutes after that, they are yelling at me to ""speed things up, because you're going to make me late!""

I tell them that these scans can take three or more hours and that they cannot use their computer in the meantime.

THEY.

GO.

BANANAS.

Make-me-late, don't know how to do your job, useless waste of money, get me your manager, I'll have your job type bananas.

t3_cjn969,Printers and exit signs,"I work in a tech support team for a decent sized organization. We get a lot of interesting questions, a lot of them about printing and photocopying, but I think these stories are my favourites:

# Printing Videos

&gt;User: Can you help me print a video?  
Support guy: How would that work?  
User: I don't know, that's why I came to you guys

# Fallen Exit Sign

A few years back one of those (unpowered) green exit signs fell down at reception during a two week break. Someone found it and rested it on the bezel of the receptionist's screen, leaning the sign against the LCD panel.

I had a call from the receptionist

&gt;Receptionist: Hi David, I've got a green exit sign picture on my screen that won't go away  
Me: Uh.. an exit sign.. picture?  
Receptionist: Yeah, you know the stick figure running out the door on a green background? That. I can't get rid of it, even when I turn the screen off and on. I think it's burned in.  
Me: That's interesting. I'll pop over and take a look

By the time I got there, the receptionist had worked out that it was a sign and was having a good laugh about it. 

I believe she did the same thing with a post-it note someone had left on her screen, but I didn't field that query so I don't know for sure.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cjmjlb,Computer Destruction Part IV: Frequent Fryer Miles,"Yet another installment in the tale of the evil $RegistrationHead and her many employees.

Thanks to some recent 'improvements' at the helpdesk, we were down to 2 people on day shift. Ordinarily, that might suffice, but $Hospital was small enough that helpdesk handled phone calls, PC deployment/repair, and application support...



It was 7am and I felt like a man treading water with a brick on his head. The phones were ringing incessantly and our wonderful schedule meant that, for the next few hours, I was THE IT department. 


I was dealing with $RN1 and $Doctor1 when the phone rings again. Caller ID says **FRONT DESK #2**. 


F$cking great. That was Cathy's office. Just what I needed. She was just going to have to leave a message, and I'd get to her when I had the time. Probably just can't figure out how to login. 


A few minutes later, I'd managed to stem the tide of phone calls, so with a sigh, I girded myself for 
battle and dialed into the voicemail system.

&gt;VM: Hi, this is Beth. I'm working in Cathy's office today and the computer won't start. Please call me back.

Relieved that I weren't dealin' with Cathy today, I called her up.


&gt;Me: He11de$k, Bacon speaking, got your voicemail, how may I help you?

&gt;Beth: Hi, this is Beth. I'm up here in $front_office and the computer keeps shutting off. Every time I restart it, it says something about cooling fan failure. Can you come look at it? We've got a room full of clients waiting and $RegHead is getting flustered already.

&gt;Me: *f$ck* Tell, you what, that's not good. I'd go ahead and shut it off before it cooks itself. 

&gt;Beth: Well, it has been running for a little while already. I'll just leave it alone until you get here

*sh!t* At this point, I still had hope. They didn’t open until 7am, so there was a chance that it hadn't been running long.

&gt;Me: OK. Honestly, if it is the fan, the computer might be dead already. How long is 'a little while'? Five minutes? 

&gt;Beth: Hehe. More like twenty minutes. I got here early today.

*le sigh*

&gt;Me: OK, I'll be up there as soon as I can. Go ahead and shut it off in the meantime.

&gt;Beth: OK, thanks! 

*click*

Of course, as soon as I started to walk out the door, the phones blew up. After a solid ten minutes of password resets and going Schwarzenegger on Citrix sessions, I finally headed up to see Beth.

As I walked down the hall, I noticed a smell, but I couldn’t name it. By the time I got to her department, the smell of hot plastic filled the air. Strange, I thought, it doesn’t *smell* like burning PCB...


I walked in and sure enough, the smell was coming from the PC. I leaned over to to unscrew the PC from its mount on the back of the monitor, but it was wayy too hot to touch. It’s dead, Jim. At that point, I started having nightmares of $RegistrationHead bursting in and screaming. Dead reg PC’s were bad news. Then I realized it had only been a day or two since the training room incident and RH was very much a ‘shoot the messenger’ person. Dear God, don’t let her show up now...if she shows up while I’m in the middle of unhooking this PC, she’s going to loose her mind.

As I stood there waiting on it to cool, RH burst into the office and immediately started yelling. She was quite insistent that it be fixed ASAP, wanted a guarantee that it would be fixed in a few minutes, etc, etc. 

This made me sweat. Getting it resovled in a hurry would be near impossible; registration PCs needed a lot of specialty software loaded, but due to software licensing issues, we deliberately didn’t keep a hot-swap PC for them. RH knew this, because she did the UAT for their software when it was implemented and wrote the workflow for her staff, but that didn’t temper her anger when I told her it would be a few hours before we could get Beth back up and running.  To Beth’s credit, she was defending me and trying to explain the situation to RH, but RH was having none of it.

Right about the time she reached peak unhappiness, my phone started ringing. Caller ID said it my boss, ContractorX. He wanted to know if we notified the COO that there was a registration PC down.  Why would the COO care? Why did they expect me to call them? When did this policy start? We’d never done that before. To this day, I have no idea, but I was losing it inside. The pressure of being the only IT staff was bad, Cathy’s PC being dead was worse, RH’s screaming was making me grit my teeth, and Cx panicking in my ear over the COO’s unhappiness was about to make me clock out and never come back.

I took a deep breath, and mumbled a few halfhearted promises to RH, tucked the hot PC under my arm and nope’d out of the situation as fast as possible.

I got a new PC setup in record time, and we had Cathy’s office (mostly) back in action an hour later. Autoprinting still had some quirks, and RH made sure to let us know how unhappy she was about that, but that was a known issue, and at that point, that was small potatoes to me. Given the shambles that was our registration software, as far as I was concerned, doing it in an hour was a minor miracle, so I was happy that that was all they could find to nitpick.

In the end, the new PC ended up being a bit more trouble free than the old one, but it didn’t stop Cathy from being our most frequent caller for the next several years. Small victories, right? 

Thankfully, this incident was the end of RH’s rage fit. As time went on, RH actually became an ally to IT, and under different circumstances was quite reasonable, but that’s another kettle of fish entirely.

t3_cjjcjr,What's a GPU?,"Just had one that made the think - what are some analogies you guys use to explain computers to the non technical types?

For example: Yesterday I had a user rush out of a team meeting and grab me mid DHCP migration because ""the (presentation) screen is all jumpy and flickery"".  I halt my work and walk to the meeting room where indeed the screen is all jumpy and flickery. Not due to any fault of the physical gear or PC itself, but because they were trying to run a 3D rendered VI type design demo (I work for a construction firm) on a low level meeting room PC designed for powerpoints and word documents. 

I initially blurted out ""Oh I see, this PC's CPU and lack of GPU can't handle anything that demanding so it's causing the screen to flicker and jump"". After a dumbfounded look from the initial reporter and all meeting attendees I switched to analogy mode:

""Ok guys - right now you're trying to pull a very large caravan down a highway with a Nissan Micra. You might get there in the end but it'll jump around like crazy and stands a very high chance of crashing en route.""

t3_cjic19,It is my proffessional opinion that your tv appears to have caught on fire,"Sadly, no pictures, will add it if I can find it. 

A while back I was working as an IT provider for a major cable company down here in Mexico. As part of my duties, I was also in charge of documenting and determining fault in cases where problems in instalation on part of our workers had, in fact, damaged our user's personal property. This is one of those stories. 

So, it started when I recieved a mystifying note on one of my ""damages"" jobs. "" Electrical fault, damaged tv"". Usually the notation is not that specific, its usually ""Tv may have problems"" when the screen got smashed to bits by Dan the Repairman for the second time this week or so. The Damages people never try to admit fault. 

So I arrive, greet the customers and before I even note how unimpressed they are I notice the smell. Its an intense penetrating smell, like when you left your  silly plastic spatula on the open fire of your stove and melted it. So the guy leads me to his living room, and I can kinda see the problem.

The cable box caught fire. Apparently it burned very fast and very insensely, because it made the underside of the tv where it was installed catch fire too. By this time I am aware there is zero to no chance of the cable company not admitting fault here. 

After talking to the client and watching the damage I piece together what happened. Dan the Repairman klutzed it up again. The  coaxial cable that goes into the box was installed from the pole. It carried a couple thousand volts from another line down to the cable box, which promptly died and catched fire. The HDMI port on the tv was also badly burned, and the main board of the TV was probably also fried, so there was no way anyone was gonna fix this tv.

t3_cjgibd,Your comPOOTers aren't workin!,"Early in my career, I used to work for a small public library as the assistant to the IT Manager. What that usually meant was taking care of the people who used the public computers. I have many stories, but this is one of my favorites.

Users without a library card could ask for a guest pass from the Information Desk. We would generate a one-time password (alphanumeric) for them that would print out on a receipt. They would take said receipt to the computer, type in the password and have access.

Easy.

One day an angry woman comes in and demands a guest pass. Done. She stalks over to the computer, plops down and starts to type out the password.

t3_cjfl9i,The 10 hour call,"I've written about the $2/minute help desk before.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the most expensive call ever received at that desk (up until the point when I resigned)

&amp;#x200B;

My position on the per-minute help desk was that of a manager. I was promoted up from a phone tech several time, and given an elite department to manage. I was basically the highest point of escalation in my help desk organization.

&amp;#x200B;

Callers had to go through the regular per-minute techs (superstars), to senior techs (computer gods), and if they couldn't figure it out - that's when I received the call (the smartest guy in the room). I spent a good portion of my time screwing off, because when you've got a team of the best-of-the-best techs, not much escapes them. I only answered the phones on a 2nd escalation (super rare) or when we were getting slammed (because $2/minute isn't beneath me.)

&amp;#x200B;

The twice escalated caller had purchased 2 top-of-the-line computers (like $2500 each), and professional in-home setup. Her first issue, the store delivered the computers to her driveway, in boxes, and drove away. She was pissed. I don't recall the exact amount, but I want to say it was more than $1000 for the installation - and they just drove away....they didn't even take it inside.... That was the first part of the call - a good old fashioned rant. I listened to everything she had to say, because $2/minute.

&amp;#x200B;

She was not a dumb lady. Not a computer person, but not dumb. Most computer peripherals are keyed, so she didn't have much trouble unboxing and setting up the computers. One in her office, and the other for her kids. I liked this lady because she wasn't helpless. The setup didn't happen, so she did it herself; for the most part everything was set up correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

Her order included 2 complete computers, monitors, keyboards, mice, speakers, HPNA (phone line ethernet) and internal PCI DSL modems. I questioned her about the DSL modems, asking if she had 2 separate DSL lines and she confirmed that she did NOT. So, a salesperson didn't understand how DSL worked and assumed that she needed 2 modems for 2 computers - this was not a surprise to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Then we got to the actual reason she called for support. Both computers worked, but not at the same time. She could have the computer turned on in her office, but while it was on - the kids computer would not turn on. When the office computer was off, the kids computer would turn on - but while it was on, the office computer would not turn on.

&amp;#x200B;

We spent time going through all of the wiring. She verified that the office and kids rooms were not on the same breaker. They were physically separate, because it took the woman 5 minutes to walk from one computer to the other (She spent $6k on 2 computers, I assume she was made of money and had a house to prove it). It was ridiculous! I knew both computers worked, but what was the issue causing them to fail to power on at the same time?

&amp;#x200B;

It was then that I decided to take care of a problem I noticed when we were going through the wiring. Having spent a few years supporting DSL service, I knew there was no point having 2 DSL modems on the same line. Judging the office PC to be the most important, I sent her to the kids room to adjust the wiring of the DSL and HPNA cards. I explained what we were doing, and she agreed that the office computer should be the internet gateway and the kids would share internet via HPNA. So we proceeded to reconfigure the wiring on the back of the kids PC to eliminate the DSL modem.

&amp;#x200B;

That turned out to be the key to the whole problem. I don't have the electronics knowledge to explain how, but I believe that a sync'd DSL modem on one computer would cause something to fault in the PCI bus DSL modem of the other computer, preventing it from powering on. Whichever computer powered on first would cause this error in the DSL modem of the other computer. She could now power on both computers at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

That was the first two hours of the call. The other 8 hours involved configuring networking on the HPNA cards, ICS, VNC (now she didn't have to spend 5 minutes walking back and forth), web content filtering, installing MS Office, kids programs, her work programs...yadda yadda yadda. She had this vision of she wanted everything - and I was going to spend every minute she was willing to pay for to get her set up to do it.

Players in today's story are Me and the Office Manager.

A while back the office manager brought me a walkie charger to take a look at, it's been sitting on my desk for a while, but today I decided to open it up and take a look inside. First hurdle is that it has stupidly deep screw holes (deeper than my usual screwdriver will fit) so first I have to hunt around to find a screwdriver that'll fit in the damn thing.

When I finally get it open, the first thing I notice is that one of the ICs is looking nice and toasty. On second inspection, I notice that all of the ICs have the same halo of doom surrounding them. I figure the unfortunate charger has been the victim of a power surge and go up to the office to reenforce the concept of surge strips.

&gt;Office Manager: Hi Vespum, what's up?

I log in remotely and it's all working fine.  She's frustrated but thanks me and does whatever she needed to do.

The next day, the same thing happens so I go visit her in person.  I ask her to show me and sure enough, it doesn't work.  I watch her type it in and see it fail.

Then I try it and it works.  Huh?

I log out and ask her to type it slowly while I watch closely... and Aha!  I see exactly what is going wrong.

She does most of her work on mobile.  The password has a few capital letters and on the PC, she was hitting the shift key and then letting it go before typing the letter.

Not today.

IT support guy called in because he has been seeing an error with our software and Outlook. You can email directly from our program using any email program that can handle the mailto: command. Most users choose Outlook because that's what Windows recommends (*cough***pushes***cough*). I still see Thunderbird occasionally though. I digress.

So the user is getting an APPCRASH error when he goes to email from our program. I remote in and take a look (he's still using Windows 7 Pro, FML) at the error. As soon as I do, I can see that it's not our error, it's a Windows side error. We remote in for everything, we're told do do it when we're in training and after a while it becomes habit. User said that he's been dealing with the error sporadically for months and that if he closes everything and reboots the software and Outlook, they play nice.

I tell him that this isn't our error. Almost all of our errors have a code attached to them that we can research. I refer him to Microsoft for more assistance.

The IT guys tells me it's our error and that we need to fix it. While he's bloviating about how long he's been dealing with this issue, I pull up the error in Google and get him a solution. I then tell him how I found it in Microsoft's Knowledge Base. I then get a rant about how all they are is link after link and no solutions (I agree, but I have Google skills this guy doesn't have apparently).

So we're having a pretty cruisy day, and week so far, only had a user account and mobile phone to setup for a new user when suddenly we have a call come in from one of our plant managers (PM)

&gt;Me: ""Hi, it's Animosus speaking, how can I help?""

&gt;PM: ""Our whole plant is down, WiFi, network cable connections, printers, even the mixer, it's not working and there are 5 trucks in line to be loaded up!""

&gt;Me: ""Ok, it sounds like there is a network issue, are you able to send someone down to check out the coms cabinet?""

&gt;PM ""Yep, I'll get &lt;Plant worker (PW)&gt; to go check it out""

About 30 seconds pass

&gt;PM ""According to PW, it's all lit up and running""

We do some more investigation on our end, speak to the ISP and they confirm there is no network outages on their end, so we book an urgent last minute flight, and unfortunatlely for me I am missing out on my two weekly coffee meet and dinner with some friends, so a little peeved.

4 hours later I arrive at the plant am I am escorted by PW (mentioned earlier) to the coms cabinet, which as it turns out is a little cutout under the stairs where the wall has just been bashed away and network equipment stuffed in there.

Straight away I can see that there is no power running to it, so I turn around to the worker that showed me there. 

&gt;Me: ""You said that it was completely lit up and running?""

&gt;PW: ""Oh yeah it was when I had a look earlier, before my shift, but it doesn't look like it is now""

&gt;Me: ""Ok, but I thought you told me it was lit up after the network went down?""

&gt;PW: ""Oh I thought it'd still be ok, didn't really want to go downstairs again because it's kind of warm""

&gt;Me: ""Well it's not running now, let me have a dig around ""

So I dig around the spaghetti cabling of network cables, power cables and general bullshit in there that has been piling up for about 5 or 6 years, to find that all of the power cables went to a powerboard, which was a cable run through the wall into the locker room, to a powerpoint with a label on it that said:

DO NOT FUCKING REMOVE, DO NOT FUCKING TURN IT OFF, IT WILL SHUT DOWN THE WHOLE FUCKING PLANT (Little harsh but I guess the old old technician really wanted to drive in the point NOT TO UNPLUG IT)

Low and behold, it is unplugged, with a phone charger plugged in it's place, I am completely dumbfounded and just stared at it for what felt like a good five minutes, I've flown across the country, missed out on my coffee meet,  because someone just wanted to charge their phone and didn't bother to read the label??

PW walks in, asks ""Everything alright?"" and then grabs the phone and unplugs it

&gt;PW ""Oh sweet, phones charged!""

I just stutter over my words until I manage to get out

&gt;""y-you unplugged the power cable, that specifically said DO NOT FUCKING REMOVE, DO NOT FUCKING TURN IT OFF, IT WILL SHUT DOWN THE WHOLE FUCKING PLANT.......to charge your PHONE????!?! Did it not occur to you that this is the reason the plant hasn't been able to work for the past 5 hours?""

PW just shrugs and says 

&gt;""Nah not really I guess, thought it was just some of the lads having a laugh, you know what locker rooms are like haha""

Well I just am left speechless, I plug it back in, walk up the stairs and make sure that everything reconnects back to the network, then drive to my hotel and expense a shitload of cider to my work because fuck, I wasted an evening I was looking forward to for someone charging their phone.

Since then we have had a power point put into the coms room, and upper management has told all plant workers that they are not allowed to charge their phones at work anymore and must get a manager to check the coms room if we have network outages in future.

TL:DR Worker unplugs power to the coms room to charge his phone and doesn't think the label on the power socket is real because ""It's the lads having a laugh""",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ci87wd,Ticket closed. Reason: scale actually router.,"One of my IT jobs was client-facing phone support for a company who supplied consumer and business PC postage solutions. We sold scales too so people could weigh their shit.

This is an account of my favorite call. 

Entities: Me, Caller, Company.

*Auto-attendant beeps

Me: Hello, this is Me, thanks for calling Company, what can I help you with? 

Caller: I can't get this scale to weigh anything. You guys sold me this scale and I need it for my business. I'm going to cancel this account because your product sucks.

Me: Yikes, OK, let's see what we can find. Is it connected to both power and the computer?

Caller: Yes, both, I just traced the wires and I see blinking lights. I know it's connected right.

Me: OK, great. Let's validate app and driver status.

[Remote in: Nothing wrong found in settings. Customer removes item, replaces item on scale: 0 action.]

Me: Huh.  Can you find any identifying information on the scale so I can look up the KB for this model? A model or revision number?

Caller: Well it's gray, square, flat, plastic, has a power cable and another cable that goes to the computer. It doesn't have a readout but it does have blinking lights. I have a heavy box on it RIGHT NOW and the computer isn't reading it. Are you sure you know what you're doing?

Me, politely: Are you sure it's our scale? There are third party scales which might not be compatible.

Caller, not politely: YES ITS YOURS I PAID EXTRA FOR IT 

Me: OK, well let's get that model number. It's on the back [describes location]

Caller, even less politely: IT'S NOT THERE. I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

Me: Let's back up. What words are written on the back?

Caller: [pause] Link System.

Me, frantically waving at the QA desk to audit my call: Do you mean, Linksys?

Caller: Yes, Linksys. That's who made this scale.

Me, calm as you like: Can I place you on a brief hold? I need to verify something. Thanks.

[Verifies that no, in fact, Linksystem doesn't make scales. I just had to be sure. CYA people.]

Me, back: Hi Caller, I think we have it. There's no easy way to say this, but that's not a scale, that's your internet router, and you may want to remove the box from on top of it.

Caller: [mortified soul death sounds, shameful weeping] 

Me: I can see how you might feel that way, let's get the scale installed. [Describes scale just to be sure.]

Caller: Oh is THAT was that what that other box was. 

Me: 

Caller: You're going to post this online, aren't you? Tell everyone how dumb I am?

Me, lying: No ma'am, we are professionals here. [Installs scale] Looks like you're good to go, thanks for calling Company, have a great day.

Epilogue: while this was paraphrased for brevity, here's the actual tickets notes as I wrote them:

""Cust called stating scale not reading. Began troubleshooting, determined that scale was actually router.

Installed actual scale, tested OK, closing ticket.""

t3_ci8pbi,The UPS driver is here! He's an IT guy,"This week I was working on a project to move an industrial facility. I'm an industrial engineer and our job was to make sure the expensive automation equipment didn't get damaged in the move and was unloaded in the right place. As I was walking through the offices of the new facility with a colleague, C, an older shipping clerk who we'll call Dorothy stopped us and needed help.

Dorothy: ""Can you two help me, I need to print this paperwork, it's extremely important to print today and the new printer doesn't work""

C: ""Did IT come by and set up your network printers on the new server""

Dorothy: ""I thought you guys are IT""

Me: ""No, we're IE, industrial engineering, different department, I don't know the new server address off the top of my head but there are some IT guys in the server room, I can get one of them for you""

Dorothy: ""You sound like IT guys""

Just then, the UPS driver showed up with some packages

Dorothy: ""We're in luck, the UPS driver is here! he's an IT guy.""

Me: ""Umm what?""

Dorothy: ""Yeah, all UPS drivers are IT, they have to carry around the little hand computers""

It was at this point that we realized that she did not know that IT was a specific profession, but rather, she thought it was just a generic term for anyone who was proficient with a computer. We got an IT guy from the IT department to map her PC to the printers on the new server, paperwork crisis averted.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_ci60q6,More money than sense...,"I spent a few months moonlighting as a technical consultant for a network hardware manufacturer....actually...they make everything, but I was representing them for their network hardware.

A couple (Joel and Susan) was directed to me regarding some network hardware for their business, and I helped them out as best I could (making recommendations, suggesting topology, etc).  By the end of the conversation, they seemed confused - and that's because one was the owner of a light fixture company and the other was his girlfriend and a lawyer.  Neither of them had any experience setting up anything like what they needed done.

So they asked if I was available to set these things up for them; my contract made no restrictions against doing that work, so I accepted. 

It took a couple of days to get all of the cables run and routers/switches configured for their POS and inventory systems, but it went well and everything worked out as expected. In their minds, it went so well that they invited me to be their once-a-week-or-so on-call tech.  For their part, they were pretty consistent.  I'd get a call around the end of the week to pick up some piece of hardware and install it, or repair something, or run some new ethernet....

I would go to their office, or either of their homes (I'll get to their homes in a moment) and do general maintenance or installations about once a week.  Sometimes they would be out of town, or they might not need anything done and I'd get a week off - but they were generally pretty consistent.  I'd get paid travel time to their location, and then an hourly rate while I was there.  It was good for a couple hundred dollars a week for an afternoon of work.

If I happened to be working at one of their homes around dinner time (Susan bought the house next door to Joel after they got serious), then I was invited to dinner - which was super weird, because Joel was a big meat-eating manly man, and Susan was a vegetarian.....but Susan did all the cooking.  She made great steaks!

One evening, I get a call about 8PM (way later than normal for them) because their printer wasn't working.  Joel had a big presentation to a client the next morning and needed to print out a bunch of things - but couldn't get it to work.  I went through the normal phone stuff, network connectivity, power switches, printer queue....and Joel said ""no man, I tried all that - please come right away, this is really important.""

So, I packed a bag with some gear and drove the hour to his house.  When I got there - I shit you not - I walked in, pressed the power button on the printer, and pages started shooting out. I looked up at Joel and he said ""huh...are you hungry?  We have steaks!"".  Susan was behind him with a smirk, shaking her head.

To this day, I'm fairly certain that he was playing dumb so I would come to dinner and he didn't have to eat steak alone and that Susan was shaking her head at the lengths he went to to have a meat-eating buddy over for dinner.

Joel and Susan were weird, but I really liked them.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ci4gdy,Why wasnt I informed before someone cut your cable?,"I work support for an ISP. Had a call yesterday after a cable had been cut due to someone being a bit careless with a digger. Customer called in around 6pm.

C = Customer

M = Me

&gt;M: [Company] customer service, c0ffeeman speaking. 

&gt;C: Hello. My internet isnt working!!! Why hasnt it been fixed yet?! Someone is digging in the street outside and i think they've cut the cable.

&gt;M: We've been informed of this and our technicians are on it and will have it back up as soon as they can. Given that it is late afternoon they wont be able to do anything aobut it today. 

&gt;C: BUT WE WERE NOT INFORMED OF THIS!

&gt;M: Neither were we. This wasn't planned in any way, the people that cut the cable called us 15-20 minutes ago to let us know. And like I said the technicians are already informed of this. 

&gt;C: THEY CUT IT ON PURPOSE?!

&gt;M: I'm certain they didnt, and that it was an accident.

&gt;C: WELL I WANT MONEY BACK FOR THE TIME IT TAKES TO FIX IT, I PAY YOU FOR A SERVICE I AM NOT GETTING. 

&gt;M: If it is not fixed within a reasonable time(1-3 working days for regular customers) we always adjust the payment on the next bill for the time you were without our services.

&gt;C: But I need internet! We're in 2019 and we don't get much done without internet!

&gt;M: We will have it up and running again as soon as we can, most likely already tomorrow.

t3_ci62g8,Lucky exploding box reveals how not to let people set things up by themselves,"A little background to get You around:

I worked for a hotel company that got divided into four parts, three of them got transferred to other owners and the fourth one was left with things no one really wanted, and was prepared to dissolve. Since I worked as sysadmin in the divided company, I managed to stay in touch with those freshly created ones, because in fact they were made from departments taken away from the divided one.

All of them used one hotel management system, which was also a pain, because of GDPR and other privacy and economy-related issues (It was basically one, big database, that would be shared among 4 different companies. It doesn't sound well right as it is, and it would get worse). I've migrated those companies to their own servers, and by this one simple trick, I became sysadmin in all of them.

So here I am, about one month after successful migration, going to the one of the new companies HQ, to check if everything is working properly and eventually discuss some things with their own, hotel IT-administrator.

The first thing that's off - he is on holiday. Okay, I've been there many times, I can handle myself. Due to traffic jams, I came a little bit later than expected, so everyone was already gone, except for one receptionist, who gave me the keys to my room. Having some free time, I plugged my laptop to the TV (ah yes, always have some additional cables in my backpack, and HDMI has proven its usefulness once again) and watched some movies.

Then I heard a loud ""BANG"", which caused power outage everywhere in the hotel. Ok, since I don't have anything better to do, I check at the reception in the lobby. Surprisingly, they also heard the bang (I was on the 4th floor), so it must have been something big. After a few minutes, I got a call from other department of this company:

\[Dept.\] -The reservation system is down, cause we can't login.

\[Me\] -Yes, I know, you have power outage in the HQ, we are currently working on it.

It turned out that the power box (i.e. that box with meters and main connection, where ""Power company lines"" become ""our lines"". It works this way that their technicians can't touch our stuff and vice-versa), simply exploded. It did that in a funny manner of exploding right before the connectors, so it took a while before we managed to prove the power company that the problem is on their side, so they have to send their people to fix it.

Okay, the power is back on line, I'm booting up reception PC to check if nothing crashed, my new receptionist friend checks fire alarms and other devices- everything seems to be working.

Then I get another call from that department which called earlier:

\[Dept.\] -Eh, guys, how long will it take you to fix it, cause we have guests that need to be checked-in to the system.

\[Me\] -What are you talking about, it should be online right now.

At this moment I'm trying to login from the reception PC, which is in the same network as the server- I get no answer from it.

\[Me\] -Okay, hold up a sec.

I go to the improvised server room this other guy made up in a control room of a bigger conference hall and see servers being out cold.

YES - that guy just set up a server containing peoples' personal data, on a floor in a room where everyone can waltz in, provided they need access to microphones and projectors (and they usually need it during presentations in huge hall) AND didn't even set it up to turn on after power outage- **something I told him to do personally (I remember that), since I cannot just ""teamviewer into"" the BIOS**. There was some UPS standing on top of the server, but it quickly discharged, cause it was the only one, powering 3 servers and a NAS.

Hadn't it been for my arrival, those poor guys would just sit there offline for at least two days, until someone switched the server back on manually. Also, the server with personal data, was just standing in a room without any bigger access control, secured only by some PC-designed UPS...

Whats worst in it, is the fact that I told him to do it- I migrated all the data remotely by myself, set the server up and installed all the required programs on it. His job was to simply pick a safe spot to place that device, plug it in and enter the BIOS to set AC-power recovery, and yet he failed it...",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ci73ms,Unusual printing issue,"This happened a few weeks back. It was a quiet afternoon at our company for our helpdesk, which gave us time to do all the paperwork that usually is being pushed aside during busy times. Who am I kidding...we were forming balls from wrapping paper and throwing those at one another over the cubicle-walls that seperate us. The two bosses were out, so we could do whatever we wanted to.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly a random phone call appears. I take the call and do the usual greeting. It is a new employee at one of our customers and he is lacking printers on his laptop. I do the usual, check print-server, check the GPOs and his AD-account. All are fine though. Because he sounds somewhat familiar with IT, I ask him to open `cmd` and hit `gpupdate /force`. The printers appear and he tells me that one of his female colleagues is having a similar issue. I tell him to do the same at her computer and call me if that didn't fix the problem. I prefer not to remote into their systems if I don't really have to and try to teach them to fix minor things by themselves. Things like `gpupdate /force` will never harm them. We don't charge them for short calls and if they call us less, then they see us in a better light and stay our customers.

&amp;#x200B;

As I got targeted by my colleagues during that call, I assume for sh!ts and giggles, it was time for payback. I wasn't missing ammunition thanks to them, but sadly I have poor aim. But as one of my IT-teachers (Thank you, Jim) used to say:

&gt;You just have to throw enough sh!t at someone. Some of that is gonna stick!

After a while of throwing wrapping-paper balls around, we proceeded to play with the employee of the month, although (s)he is our newest member in the deparment. The floor-cleaning Roomba.

&gt;Start working!  
&gt;  
&gt;Have a rest!  
&gt;  
&gt;Go charging!  
&gt;  
&gt;Charging!

Those are pretty much the only things it can say and we are trying to come up with a plan to link those sounds with our helpdesk-hotline. So in case that all four of us want to have lunch together, we can still keep that hotline working by letting the Roomba handle those calls during our absence.

&amp;#x200B;

Another call appears and this time it is the female coworker of the previous caller. Since ~~my colleagues cannot wait to target me again~~ I'm already familiar with the problem, it is decided that the best option is to let me handle the case. My colleagues are ~~such bastards~~ so wise.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;`I cannot print anything. None of the printers work.`  
&gt;  
&gt;So, you can see all the printers?  
&gt;  
&gt;`Yes.`  
&gt;  
&gt;What happens when you try to print?  
&gt;  
&gt;`Nothing.`  
&gt;  
&gt;Ok, I guess I'll have to login to your session with teamviewer.

I try printing a test page, but nothing happens. I try to check on the print server whether the printer has print-jobs in its queue, but nothing there. The printers are also marked as online and I can ping them from her computer. I open a document and try to print, but before I can actually get there her Word freezes up on me and can only be killed by taskmanager. Just to be sure this wasn't a coincidence, I try it again (and maybe another few times because I'm neurotic), just to meet the same result over and over again. Since I had taskmanager open, I switch to the Service tab and check the spooler. It isn't started.

&amp;#x200B;

Victory at last!!! I start the spooler and try it again, but same result. After a brief period of about another 20 failed tries of the same procedure, I switch to the Service tab again to see that the spooler is still not running. This is odd...well, let's try again. Not starting. I open the services in the proper way to see whether I will get some kinda error message that way and I do.

&gt;0x8..... The endpoint is a duplicate

Since I live in Germany, I get the German version of that message and I put that into Google, as I had no clue what the heck that was for. I usually google with English terms to get better results, but for some reason I stayed with German that time and got weird results. It was mostly about audio not working because of some driver- and faulty-registry stuff. Since that applied to this case in a limited way, I was left with no real clue, but `Something with audio`.

&gt;I know this sounds unrelated, but have you installed an audio device to your system lately?  
&gt;  
&gt;`No, I haven't...wait, well I brought my headset with me and plugged it in. But...`  
&gt;  
&gt;Could you unplug it please?  
&gt;  
&gt;`Uhm...ok...`

I see on the screen that the device was unplugged and start the spooler. It works. I open Word again and go to Print and it actually opens. I select the printer and start it. She hears the printer go to work and then she screams.

&gt;`How fricking awesome is that?! How the heck and what the heck is this?`  
&gt;  
&gt;To be quiet honest, I got no clue and at this point I'm too afraid to investigate any further, as I don't know how long this would take. Are you satisfied with the current solution of unplugging your headset if you want to print?  
&gt;  
&gt;`Hahaha, yes, I still cannot believe it. I doubt I'll ever forget this one.`  
&gt;  
&gt;Me neither. Have a good day.  
&gt;  
&gt;`Have a good day!`

The reason I didn't delve further into this case was that I'd rather ask the customer whether they are satisfied with the current state/solution. They know that making one look into will cost them money. And since we charge 120€/hour, I'd say quite a bit of money. Sometimes you'd rather unplug your headset when you need to print than spending I dunno how many hours worth of troubleshooting in order to fix that problem.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Somehow her headset caused her spooler-service to malfunction and not start up. After unplugging her headset, she was able to print again.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ci7eqi,"Sometimes, everything happens at once","I'm quietly reading your posts for some time now but I've just decided to participate. This is my first post on reddit ever, so consider yourself warned and don't expect too much. And, well, English isn't my first language but I'll try my best to hide as many mistakes as possible.

To give a little context, I'm not working in any kind of commercial tech support but I have been part of my school's tech support back in the days. We've been a group of half a dozen students and we were responsible for cleaning and maintaining overhead projectors as well as handing out notebooks and video projectors to teachers. Having computers in each class room has not been common in our school at this time.

One day, my geography teacher needs a notebook and video projector for her class. She usually uses old wall maps and is not tech savvy at all. She told me, there would be students to help her out if she runs into trouble. So I only reminded her that the battery will only last half an hour, so she has to plug it into a socket. After that, I went to my English class.

Me = well, that's me, I guess  
GT = my geography teacher  
PS = Presenting student in her class

*My English teacher was really confused but managed to calm her down after a few moments of more swearing. She was a little ambivalent but decided to let me go to help her.*

&gt;GT: Okay, so have a look and find out what's wrong.  
Me: Will do. What happened?  
GT: PS was just about to start her presentation and everything went black. It has worked fine at the presentation before.  
Me: It shut down. Why didn't you connect the notebook's power supply to a socket?  
GT: There is no free socket anymore. There is only one in here and the video projector is connected to it.  
Me: There is a second one under this cover down here. You usually connect your overhead projector to it.  
GT: Oh, I didn't know you can use it for other devices, too. It thought, those projectors are the only thing, you can connect there.

*I rebooted the notebook and was about to leave because I thought, my job was done. But I was wrong.*

&gt;PS: Hey! Stop! The video projector isn't working. I guess, you broke something.  
Me: I'm pretty sure, I didn't, but let me have a look. Maybe the video output is disabled after the restart.  
GT: You know, you are supposed to fix it, not to break anything. Get on with it!  
Me: I know. The video output is turned on. I'll check the cable next. Erm... why did you connect the video cable to the projector's output instead of its input?  
PS: Well, as GT left to get you after the screen went black, I tried to fix it myself but obviously, I couldn't.  
Me: You know, the video input is where the video signal gets into the projector, so you it has already been connected properly before. Just out of curiosity, what made you think that this would help?  
PS: It said 'video out', so I thought, this is what to do if the video... well, goes out.

Me: That's not your file. It's a link to your file. According to its properties, you saved it on the desktop on your computer at home.  
PS: Okay. Then fix it.

Me: Yes, you can.

Me: The reboot might have disabled the connection to the wireless network.

Me: You don't have a socket for that. They will install you one during the summer break and give you your own computer.

t3_ci79gt,Faint printing solution,"Tech support is perhaps 5% of my job and things are usually quite smooth.   I manage about 40 devices across 6 locations but it's rarely a headache.  Sometimes, there are things that just make me laugh though.

A number of years ago, we all had our own desktop printers.  They all took the same toner and I usually kept several new ones on hand.  That day, I had coincidentally given those out and was going to pick up more during lunch.

A coworker came to me an hour before I left.  She complained about getting faint printing.  I asked if she knew what a toner cartridge was.  Most of our office is fairly good with technology and they are quite capable of replacing their own toner.  She sounded offended that I'd even ask such a question, saying ""yes, of course!""

So I explain I'd have a new toner for her in the early afternoon but she could probably get some decent pages in the meantime by shaking the toner cartridge a bit first.  I showed with hand motions how I thought it would be best.

A few minutes later, another coworker pages me.  Apparently, there's something I just gotta see for myself.

I make my way over and the lady is really going to town on the toner.  She's working up a massive amount of sweat too.

However, she didn't take the toner out of the printer.  She had picked the whole printer up and was trying very hard to shake it, cords attached but extra paper tray dangling below.

I just stood there stunned in disbelief for a good 15 seconds before telling her to stop.  

I was very polite to her, partially because I didn't dislike her and I can appreciate her taking initiative.  I also very much respected someone of her stature that could do that to a printer that size at such an awkward angle (I forget exactly but it was one of those old boxlike HP laserjets)",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cht5qv,This call broke my heart,"This story happened many years ago when I was working at a multi media company in customer services.
Back story: this was a recent career change, as I used to be self employed and spent most of my adult life working in manual labour, so being sat at a desk listening to customers bitch about their crappy WiFi or TiVo not working was very new to me.

Cast: 

Me: whoever that is?

SW: sweet woman 

The call comes through and I say my usual script “ hello my name is....”and ask her for her account number 

Sw: ( in a very sweet shy voice) I’m so sorry I don’t know it, my husband usually does these kind of calls.

ME: that’s ok madam, I just need to ask a few questions to make sure that it’s your account.

She agrees and answers all questions perfectly, 

Me: so what can I help you with today?

I say trying to sound cheerful, as I usually love talking to the old dears, and making them laugh just to put a smile on their faces.

SW sounds very upset and I could hear her almost crying on the phone, she collects herself and says, SW: I’m afraid that my husband has passed away and I don’t know what to do with the new account.

What had happened was that when her husband passed, she called our company to change the name on the account from her husbands to herself, and due to a glitch in the order, the system thought she was a new customer and was being billed as one as well as still being charged for the old account and was being charged late fees, as well as being charged a month in advance for being a new customer.
But that’s not all, she was also charged for moving home.

As I’m looking at this monumental cluster fuck of an account, I see what her bill was supposed to be £20 per month for a phone line, it was now over £200! WTF.

As this is being told to me and I’m seeing it in front of me, i can hear the poor SW crying on the phone, she only had a tiny state pension to live on, how the hell was she going to pay for this bill?

ME: oh my god!...ok, let me tell you the good news first.

SW: alright.

ME: I’m sure I can get rid of most of the charges, the bad news is I’m going to need you to hold the line for quite a while as I deal with all the departments involved.

Note: I cannot call her back as the system automatically switches the account as soon as the call ends.

I then spend the best part of an hour talking to my manager, the credit department,retentions and the moving department, AT THE SAME TIME! On multiple lines all the while I’m still talking to SW.

Finally after talking to all those different departments for nearly an hour and missing my lunch break, I got back on the call.

ME: hi, I’m back again.

SW: oh, hello... did you manage to do anything?

She was such a sweetheart and was so patient with me.

ME: yes I did, ( I say like I’ve just conquered a nation ) your husbands account has now been shut down and all charges have been erased, I got my manager to refund the advance charge on the new account as you are not a new customer, I got the moving team to refund you the moving charge and I took care of the late fees, so now you’re direct debit is back to £20 per month as usual.

SW: oh that’s amazing, thank you so very much.

ME: it was my pleasure and once again I am so sorry about this ( I apologised a lot throughout the call).

After that, her son comes on the phone and firstly thanked me for getting her account settled, and then payed her bill for that moth, so in the end the £200 bill that she was looking at turned into absolutely nothing.

This call really hit me hard because I had lost both my parents earlier that year, and just like SW my dad had everything in his name and my mum didn’t have a clue what to do.

Thanks for reading.

*Yet another installment in the tale of the evil $RegistrationHead and her shamefully inept employees. This little episode happened at least a year after Cathi ruined her PC, so we had been using $EMR long enough for everyone to know better.*


I’m sitting at my desk. Lunchtime had come and gone. The phone rings and who could it be but RH. She’s nearly screaming. From what I could make out, she was in the training lab, trying to train her new staff on $EMR and it’s fairly vomiting errors. Thank god they’re right down the hall?


Sighing, I ambled down to the training lab, and RH accosted me as I walked through the door. Writing this today, I don’t remember what she said because all screaming sounds the same to me at this point, but it wasn’t pleasant, and she kept yelling the whole time I was working.


She was on to something though, as I looked at it, the errors were bizarre. It looked like most, but not all, of the servers were shut down...you could connect, but everything was blank, no data popped up, no matter what you clicked. With the realization that this was over my pay grade, I started spam calling our software team and finally, thankfully got $Rainman to answer. This guy was laid back, very smart and with his slavelike devotion to facts and figures, gave not one single fsck. 


&gt;Bacon: Hey dude, RH is trying to do training and $EMR is broken. Are you guys working on the test environment?

&gt;RM: HAHAHAHAHA. Yeah I’d say they’re having problems, I shut that sh#t down to do a database upgrade.

&gt;Bacon: LOL OK. Was this planned?

&gt;RM: Nah, we just went for it.


RH was *remarkably* unhappy when she got that news just then. She started screeching things like “this is completely unacceptable” and “what am I supposed to do?” before looking around, and proclaiming “Well, I guess there’s nothing we can do here guys, let’s call it a day”. 

As she spun on her heel and stormed out, she was threatening to complain to our manager, etc, etc.

I didn't think much of it then, but this must have really put her in a mood to raise Cain, because her reaction to what happened next was...excessive and ended in her Nth attempt to get me fired.

When I worked on the Toshiba help desk, I got my favorite call ever.

The woman on the line said that her laptop screen was broken.  RED FLAG!  I informed her that we don't ship them with broken screens, and that unless she received it broken - then it wouldn't be covered under warranty (we could get away with being snarky on the phone back then).  She proceeded to give me her serial number and I started looking things up.

The serial number revealed that the laptop was delivered over a year prior, and that the cost of a screen and labor to replace it was more than the cost of a comparable laptop.  She starts to beg me to make it under warranty, but I really couldn't do anything for her.  This is when she says ""Let me tell you how it happened, and maybe you can find a way to make it under warranty.""

I figured, maybe she has a note from God or something....hearing a story can't hurt anything.  So she begins her story with ""My boyfriend is abusive....""  She goes on to explain how her boyfriend was punching her and she tried to use the laptop as a shield.

Really, I did feel bad for her.  I told her that it still wasn't under warranty, and that's when I gave the best tech support advise of my entire tech career.  


""You need to leave him!""  


She said that she had kicked him out, and that when he moved out - he stole her boat.  I suggested that she call the cops, but she said she already got the boat back....he ran a red light and the boat got t-boned.

IC: Oh, I’m not sure how to read it it. It looks very technical, I’ll have to spell it out. It says open square bracket U-S-E-A-D-M-I-N-P-A-S-S-W-O-R-D, then close square bracket.

t3_ch7jw6,I made a regrettable mistake on family vacation...,"I feel like such a dumb-ass for letting this happen...

So, my uncle bought a beach house on the east coast and organized a large family vacation, to which my wife and I were invited.  Hell yeah! We're going to the beach! The house is HUGE, and every room is decked out with wall mounted TVs, DVD players, and Roku sticks for video streaming.  

The biggest downside is definitely my neurotic, antisocial, suuuper needy aunt (lets call her Nancy), who clearly has no social graces or sense of personal boundaries, and zero chill...she reminds me of folks I've met who have Asperger's or mild Autism except, in her case, dial the ""neurotic and annoying"" meter to 11 and you've got my aunt Nancy. She decides that she's going to spend this whole vacation flitting about, working on and stressing out over every single little item at the property in need of repair.  This includes appliances, furniture and, yep you guessed it, electronics.  She was going to stress and freak over this stuff for the entire 9-day vacation, though I didn't realize it at first.

So we arrive and begin to unpack, greeting our family members as they come in and getting a feel for the place we'll be staying.  Nancy tries to switch on the living room TV, but the remote isn't working.  It turns out the Roku remote needed to be re-paired with the TV.  It's a simple fix; I offer to check it out and get it working in short order.  And then, my friends, I uttered the thing that would haunt me for the next 9 days...I couldn't stop myself...it all happened so fast...

I turned to my Aunt Nancy and (oh you poor, ignorant fool), looked her right in the eyes and I said:

""Hey, I'm an IT technician! Just let me know if you need help with anything!""

#####**UPDATE:**    
Some of you asked for updates/examples from the trip, so I'll copy/paste one of my responses from below.  And yes, she pestered me for the entire 9 day vacation - the worst of which was, I shit you not, the day we were leaving, just as I was in the middle of loading up the car. Anyway, here's more info, including one of our little moments:

&gt;**""Most of it was really, really basic stuff like mis-matched remotes, dead batteries, wrong inputs, and of course the other IT-adjacent stuff like her gas station iPhone charger not working.**

&gt;**Periodically, she'd insist on my help with something, and then once I was there she'd get totally side-tracked, dragging me along as her unwitting hostage. Here's one example: There was a TV witch multiple inputs but she couldn't tell which was which. So instead of just leaving it be, (ffs, just hit INPUT until you get to the one you want!), she insists on taking a deep-dive into the TV settings in an attempt to relabel the display interface itself for each specific input (defaults HDMI 1, HDMI 2, COM, etc) to reflect exactly what was plugged in to each of them (DVD, PC, Cable, etc). And hey, she's got every right to spend her own time fiddling with those settings if she cares that much about it. Unfortunately, she barely understood the remote/TV and had major issues navigating the menus. So she starts trying every single menu option, trial-and-erroring her way thru it, and all the while insisting she needs me there to help.**

&gt;**And I'm just standing in the room with her the whole time, trying to get out of there with a ""Welp looks like you've got this under control"", but she won't let me leave until she's done her little OCD trip. I mean I could have been a dick and just noped the fuck out, but I really didn't want to start any drama with this already clearly neurotic lady...""**

t3_chdixj,What corporate thinks of as an adequate tech level for an IT company,"Okay, so this is my first time... Please be gentle.

I work for a relatively massive IT company in a role that would mostly be considered customer support, but we are a weird hybrid with tech support. The following is a condensed version of my long struggle with corporate to get us some upgrades, since we are a legally vital, country level department.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Okay, so, we need some upgrades. Best would be completely new office PCs everywhere(about 200), but I realize that is unlikely to happen. Can we at least get a second 4 GB RAM stick and a small SSD in our current PCs? (those are our bottlenecks for various reasons)

Corporate: Oh, no no no, that would be expensive.

Me: Those are literally the cheapest computer parts. It would be a drop in the bucket.

Corporate: Sorry, that cannot be done. Besides, your team has the newest set of PCs anyway. If we did have a new batch, you would have to be the last ones to get it.

Me: Wait, what? How old are these?

Corporate: 5 years.

Me: ...what? How old are the rest?

Corporate: Only 10 years.

Me: .....We are supposed to be a first rate IT company... Actually, nevermind. Okay, fine. Then can we at least get an upgrade to \*second most important program\*? You literally have to wait 5 seconds at the very least after every single click, and it is full of things we do not even need, which are slowing it down.

Corporate: What do you mean? We even held a poll and put in the things you wanted.

Me: Literally no one asked for those things. Everyone wanted it to be faster though.

Corporate: Well, we did tell you that that is not a valid request.

Me: ......And what about \*most important program\*?

Corporate: What about it? It is literally the most modern in the industry.

Me: The developers stopped support for our version 2 years ago... It is so slow, we are literally spending half our time just waiting for it to do something.

Corporate: well, we still have a contract to use it for some years...

Me: .......I dread to ask, but do you know all that admin stuff you force us to do besides everything else?

Corporate: Yes?

Me: Here is a list of simple things that would be easy to implement and massively boost speed and efficiency.

Corporate: But we would have to pay the developers to do those, no?

Me: Alright, then here is a program I wrote. You literally just have to get IT security to nod on it, and everyone just has to  run it. It costs nothing, I volunteer as support, and it should make life much easier for everyone involved. It just simulates a very fast user.

Corporate: You are not allowed to put any outside program on these computers! That is strict corporate policy!

&amp;#x200B;

And so on, and so forth.... The struggle continues to this very day...

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I just remembered. I have been constantly pestering IT for months to get things updated too. I am talking about things like Firefox, free programs that we support but have no right to install, JAVA 8... we still use 7 and our supported programs do not even run with 7 anymore most of the time, etc. So far, all they managed is to make the out of date problem with some of them, change to a corrupted install problem...

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: So, I just woke up and people seem to like this... Many of you suggeste I explain to management in money sense. This may work, but t will probably not.

But hey, they gave me free cookies sometimes so I didn't mind helping out with their personal devices. 

This is a tale of the time I was the ID10T. You  see my keyboard wasn't typing in the specialist system we use for payments.

So down I get on my knees and take out my keyboard cable and put it on my desk so it doesn't get lost in spaghetti junction. I take out the cable of the keyboard of my neighbour's workstation and plug it in. What do you know; it's still not working.   

After gulping down on my (first) cup of Joe, I sat up thinking this was going to be a very technical; after all I did have my tech hat on. Before I thought to get into the nitty and gritty side of things, I just thought, ""hey, let me just turn it off and on again."" And what do you know; that worked! Great, I thought and put the keyboard's cable back into my neighbour's tower. I sit back and I'm ready to start, or so I thought. I had the same issue that caused me to switch keyboards in the first place. So I shake/move the mouse quite fast and I feel my hand hit a cable. Turns out it was the cable for *my* keyboard. I hadn't plugged it back in. Cried internally.

t3_ch6idv,If you don't work it like it's hot...,"Hi all! So excited to finally post here!

So about three years ago I got hired at a small electric brokering firm to help them develop a new IoT hardware product that would report electricity usage in real time. The grand idea was that by receiving minute-by-minute updates, we could more accurately bill customers and also try to help them save money by sending notifications whenever their usage was abnormally high.

Over the course of that project we went down a ton of rabbit holes to try to interface with power boxes: IR receivers, proprietary wireless protocols, proprietary hardware devices, and finally, the clear winner: magnetism.

See, inside every circuit box in a building, there are 2-4 ""poles"" that current runs through. This current happens to be strong enough that it actually projects a magnetic field around the pole; you can measure said current with special Current Transformer clips like [these](https://www.neur.io/wp-content/uploads/Press-Release-Banner.jpg). If we hooked these up to an Arduino we could measure current usage in real time - problem solved.

Except, we needed to make sure the problem actually was solved. This involved opening up a live power box and installing our clips so we could get readings off of them, to make sure the data we were getting was actually sensible. Now, I'm not an electrician. I just pounce on a keyboard a bunch of times and people seem to be happy with that. There's no way I was going to *clip a piece of metal with my hands to another piece of metal that is carrying power directly from a __freaking power plant__ and connect it to a __$25 Arduino__*. 

Luckily for us, the nice thing about working for an electric company, they actually tend to have a few electricians around.

Scene. Location: Our electric firm headquarters. Basement. In front of the power box.

* Three of my coworkers, who all happened to be friends I had made during my freshman year of college and convinced my bosses to hire. Two CS, one EE who convinced us that completing a direct connection from a power plant to an Arduino was actually a reasonable goal to strive for. 

* Me, a wide-eyed 18-year-old wondering if he is about to watch a man die. Trying to calculate the most optimal place to stand that would avoid most of the fallout from any haphazard explosion / flying carcass while still appearing to be brave enough to stand near the power box.

* Our hero, the electrician, who we'll call Ryan, although his real fake name was George. Ryan was a middle aged guy who listened to punk rock while welding parts for his motorcycle, so I had come to like him in the few minutes that I had known him.

We quickly briefed Ryan on the job, and he nodded as if to say ""this is crazy, but I do crazy."" He set to work while the rest of us watched. Basically [this](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse3.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.U1yLltML_Z1Ly_AnkYOl9wHaJk%26pid%3DApi&amp;f=1), but George was Andre. Tensions were generally high; this was probably the most dangerous thing any of us had ever witnessed at a workplace before.

To be fair, as long as there was no current, the poles should actually be completely safe to touch. Not that I was willing to test that theory, but hey, *science*. What made it scarier is that there wasn't really a good way to verify it: normally with any live wire you can just put a multimeter to it or at least execute the tried-and-true technical operation of putting your hand on it, palm facing outward (so the shock didn't cause your fingers to wrap themselves around the wire.) But with the current and voltages at hand, palm facing outward or not, the resulting force would immediately kill anyone and anything, including most run-of-the-mill $15 multimeters. I'm sure they make industrial multimeters for situations like these, but we didn't have one at the time.

Now, being in the power field, we happen to also run a solar installation business. As such, the building is 100% solar powered on a good day and even on most bad days. As part of the installation, we had this big red switch that disconnected us from the grid entirely, allowing us to be self sustaining. We also had fancy ""smart"" batteries that ran web servers to display their dashboards, so you could set advanced parameters and set up charging schedules and all that good stuff (these become important later on). That made life much easier for Ryan since all he had to do was hit the switch and power down the solar batteries. Once everything was done, it was show time.

Step one: Disconnect from the grid. Red switch flipped, now running totally on solar. Yell into the office for everyone to save their emails and unfinished Word docs because the lights were about to go out.
 
Step two. Kill the batteries. Each battery pack had a power button and an LCD screen; all we had to do was hit the power button twice for the screen to say ""SHUTTING DOWN..."" We shut down all three. Emergency floodlights and cellphone flashlights ON; building lights, printers, punk rock radios, and monitors OFF. A bunch of sensors and random devices start beeping to signal they've switched to UPS power. To reiterate: not only are we scared shitless at what is occurring in front of us, but we are also now totally in the dark with a ton of mysterious beeping noises.

Step three: Cover off. Flip all the breakers just to be totally sure that there is nothing feeding into the poles. Grab the clips.

Step four: Clip the left side first. Approach carefully and, with expert precision, wrap the clip around the pole.

Step five: Boom. Loud bang. Several bright sparks cascading around your vision. Near electrocution. Good, good, all according to plan. 

You know how in CoD your screen turns bright white whenever you get hit by a stun grenade? Yeah. Something like that.

""Now, kids, how come I didn't just die?""

Ryan killed the silence with a sentence only an experienced electrician can be proud of. We are still speechless.

He walks over to the the third battery pack, and points at the LCD:

""UPDATING...""

*Motherfucker.*

My God, I had just become an adult and nearly got a front row seat to watch a man explode because of the IoT equivalent of fucking Windows updates.

""Why...uh...why didn't you die, Ryan?"" I mustered. 

""Well you see,"" he said, powering the third box off for good, ""if you don't work it like it's hot,"" clipping the right side (*without an explosion this time*), ""you're gonna drop it like it's hot."" He grinned the type of shit-eating grin you could only grin after clearly kicking the Grim Reaper in the balls in front of four college-aged bystanders. To this day I still have no idea what he did to completely avoid getting hurt during that fiasco.

And just like that, the clips were in and power was brought back up. The Arduino, thankfully, also did not explode. In fact, our readings were flawless.

What a time to be alive when batteries come with their own computers. Back in my day it was the other way around.

&amp;#x200B;

One day I got a call from a mid-level attorney, who had been with the firm for several years.  The call basically went like this...

Me: Thank you for calling support, how can I help you?

Atty: I can't log in.

Me: You're probably connected to the wrong group.  Can you please read me the bottom line of your screen, where it shows your group?

Atty: (long pause)

Atty: Dell

Me: Hold on.   Puts Atty on hold until I stop laughing.

Me: OK, the top line of your screen should also show the group.  Can you please read me the top line?

Atty: ""Bad command or filename"", which means the users tried to login to the wrong group.

Me: That can't be the top line.  Please read me the line above it.

Atty: Oh, OK.  Bad command or filename.

Me: (Mutes phone, sighs, and unmutes).  And the line above that?

Me: Uh huh, and the one above that?

Me: And the next one up?

Atty: ""Welcome to BigLawFirm.  You are connected to..."".  Oh, you meant the TOP line!

Below is a briefed up version of the chain of emails between ME and Jack\* (not persons name)

&amp;#x200B;

Me - Good day there Jack\*, my name is willbeonekenobi from &lt;my company name&gt; and according to our records, &lt;Time and Attendance&gt; software is about to expire (14 days left on your install) on your pc. I will need for you to follow the steps below to send me the activation request file that is unique to your pc.

1. Open program and log in
2. Click on 'Configuration' then scroll to 'Registration'
3. Click on 'Save Activation Request File' button. Save this file to your desktop.
4. Reply to this email with just the file that you just created as an attachment.

Jack - Good day willbeonekenobi. For past few days I've been getting this error message that is in the picture (attachment is a pdf of a printed photo from a potato camera showing that the program is about to expire and will need to re-activate soon)

&amp;#x200B;

Me - That attached picture is why I am asking you to follow the steps in my first email (the one you replied to) as the program is going to expire in 14 days.

&amp;#x200B;

(25 minutes later)

&amp;#x200B;

Jack - Where in the first email are the steps you want me to do? Why can't you do them?

&amp;#x200B;

Me - The steps are at the end of the first email and we do not have access to your pc as that is against your companies IT policy.

&amp;#x200B;

Jack - And do I have to do this now or later?

&amp;#x200B;

Me - We can do this now or whenever you feel like during the next 14 days to avoid any downtime.

Jack - &lt;reply is 424 pages of garbled mess, like user had opened the contents of the file in notepad, and copied its contents into the reply&gt;

I then immediately send it off to our supplier. 2 minutes later I get a reply with the users activation code.

&amp;#x200B;

Me - Okay Jack, your re-activation code is XXXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXX. To reactivate using this code you just need to follow the instructions in the first email again but instead of clicking on the 'Save Activation Request', you must click on the 'Registration' button. Once you input the code the 'Activate' button will 'light up' and when it does you must click on it. Then your program would be licensed for another year.

t3_ch3zge,But how do I check voicemail?,"LTL, FTP, Mobile, not primary account, etc.


This happened recently. Our company provides support to a smaller sister company (more like ugly stepchild).  This includes fiscal, administrative, and internal tech support (among other things).  Their archaic Mitel system was dieing and we were prepping a migration to Cisco, matching what we already have/support.  We were about a week from cutover when the old system died. Luckily we had the new hardware at ~99% config'd (the week away was mostly waiting on paperwork, training scheduling, and a service cutover) so we rush deployed in under 2 hrs.  It also happened to be a minimally staffed week so we only had to train the Administrative Secretary, two Admin, and a few others on site.  I was on site and helping the AS get familiarized with her new phone.

Me: now that the main line is setup on your phone you need to get a voicemail message on setup on it.  All you have to do is select the main line like this [*presses line button*], hit this voicemail button [*presses voicemail button*] then follow the prompts.

*Welcome to Cisco Unity connection...*

Me: [*hangs up call*] your temp passcode is 1234.  When you log in it will prompt you to change your passcode and walk you through recording your greeting message.

AS: ok.  But we should probably have voicemail on the main line.  How do I set that up?

Me: [*stares blankly then shakes it off*] Yes, we setup voicemail on that line.  As I wa...

AS: [*quite interruptingly*] Well then I really need to set that up.  How do I get into the voicemail. It's very important I get that setup soon.  How long until its ready.


Me:  you press this button to select the line [*points at button*] then this one to enter voicemail [*points at other button*]

AS: but what do I press to make sure I'm getting into the main line and not my peronal voicemail.

Me: [*questions reality; points at line button*]

AS: ok, but which button is for voicemail?

Me: [*takes a deep breath to try and hide the sigh*] the button that looks like a tape reel [*points at button*]

AS: What is my pin?  Are they the same as before?  How am I supposed to get in if I don't know my pin?

...I wish I was making this up or over exaggerating it... but this is verbatim, as well as I recall it (from about a week ago).  This conversation went on like this for about 20min for voicemail and transferring calls.  I was later told she recorded her personal voicemail on the main line and the main line voicemail on her personal extension (she had insisted on recording them *after* we had left which is why I hung up after demonstrating dialing into voicemail).

We spent the next few days writing up both detailed and quick reference guides and, after receiving them, every call from AS was her swearing what she needed wasn't on either then us meticulously hand-holding her through horribly simple guides (I should point out, the system is being used successfully yet we have had only one other call since sharing the reference guides, and it was because we forgot to setup their voicemail box).

It warms my heart knowing that she is also the self-appointed tech liaison at the facility and tries to intercept all tech requests before they get to us because she's *oh so good at it and her staff is horrible at communicating anyway*.

TL;DR: walked user through how to use voicemail in new phone system then they proceeded as if the conversation never took place.

Me: well, your modem is where your phone services come from as well.  If it's offline, then your phone services won't work.  It's also not possible for them to hack your phone line, because it's digitally encrypted, then sent from your modem directly to our system office, where it is directly connected to the person on the other side...

t3_cgcm14,It was the font color.,"One day, I received a call from a client.  I work phone support for small to medium sized businesses with a few enterprise level ones in there.  We probably have like.... 70000 actual seats (computers with our support software on it).

&amp;#x200B;

Call comes in and the guy is unable to print some kind of PDF or document.  I don't remember exactly what type of document it was, only that it won't print.  So after gathering some info, I remoted into his computer to see the problem.  He couldn't print.  When he clicked the option to print the document it would freeze up and crash the program.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone's worked with printers before, you'd know this is sometimes indicative of the printer itself just having an aneurysm or going offline and is unreachable.  So naturally the first thing is to check the printer to ensure it's online and printing.  It was, everything else worked fine.  So I printed some other documents for a test on his machine and they worked.  At this point, I was convinced that there was a problem with this one specific document.  There was nothing outwardly wrong with it.  No weird texts, no pictures, no macros, no special formulas, no HTTP links, nothing that would be unassuming to the average user.

&amp;#x200B;

Now prior to me getting this issue, this has already been worked on by half a dozen other techs both from my company and the company we contract out from.  The company we contract to, we'll call them Tier 4, is the one we send the big stuff to such as server setups, physical onsites, purchases, etc.  The issue has been going on for TWO MONTHS and apparently no one has been able to figure out what's going on here.  The company who called was getting a little agitated about it.

To put it into perspective, I'm a Level 1 tech.  But in my company a Level 1 tech does far more than a traditional L1 tech on a helpdesk (which ususally just does passwords and other pleb tier work).  I don't like to brag about anything I do because I Feel it's inappropriate but I don't get paid enough for what I do based on what I actually know.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this issue has been through L2 techs (who are allowed to spend HOURS researching these problems, I can't), T4 techs and probably some other L1 techs.  So it's been through the gamut of experience and knowledge ranges.  Anyway, 2 months, no printing, got it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a habit of finding ultra-abstract ways to solve problems.  I'm talking, putting like 3 and 5 together to get 22.  Yeah, that statement makes no sense and neither does some of the things I do to solve issues.  So I open up another document, a blank one.  I take all of the data from the busted document and move it over to the new document.  Save it, try to print, failed.  Made a new document, moved the data in, didn't save it, printed, failed.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point the voice in my head is like ""all right, the problem is with the data in this document, it has to be.""  But then I ask myself, ""Okay, but there's nothing in the document that's out of the ordinary.  What gives?""  So I just start hacking half the data off.  I would basically just arbitrarily cut the data in half (if it's 4 pages, I'll take 2) and then copied that to a new document and print.  It worked.  Sweet, so now I smell blood.  This errant data wasn't about to hide from me.  So I zoned in on the half that was broke and kept narrowing it down.  I eventually got to one offending paragraph.  There was NOTHING wrong with it.  It was a paragraph.  So I'm thinking.... okay, wtf else could I do?  So the voice in my head is like ""Just flipping wing it and see what happens"".  All right, birdman time.  So I just started doing random stuff.  Changed the font, still gave the issue.  Changed font size, still the issue.  The only thing left to do was the color.

The font color.  Are you kidding me?  COLOR?!  Normally, I'd write it off.  But then I realized that sometimes things done to documents can freak printers out and they'll print gibberish, mess up the letter e on page 16 line 36 character 42, or outright crash and shut itself down.  I don't know how or why, but they do.  Anyway, I changed the color from the black that it was to 90% gray, which is pretty close.  Printed... and it worked.  It somehow worked.

&amp;#x200B;

I recompiled the whole document, printed, it failed.  Swapped the entire document's color, printed, and it worked.  Needless to say I got a praise from both companies and 2 recognition cards for it because evidently NO ONE could figure out what this problem was.

TL;DR - When dealing with a document that randomly doesn't print or operate properly, try taking the data and moving it to a new document.  If it does the same thing, the problem is with the data.  Keep cutting it in half until you find the bad section and just try WHATEVER comes to mind.  Even if it seems outlandishly ridiculous.

t3_cglfco,Good old issue snowball.,"I've mentioned this before, but I work for the fruit-based company as a T2 advisor. This was the last call of the week last week and came in about 20 minutes before my shift ended. This is a long one.


A customer calls in because his Hotmail account has been hacked (already a red flag, usually when they say they've been ""hacked"" it's all hooey) and his contacts have all gone missing from his devices. He had spoken to a colleague previously who had restored from a backup from before the contacts disappeared and everything was there again.


When he called, he wanted to get his contacts back on his other iPhone and his iPad. Should be a case of logging in to the accounts and have the info sync, right? Yeah, no.


During the process of the ""hacking"", the customer changed his Hotmail password. This meant that the device where his contacts had been restored to hadn't taken in the new password. When we logged in to his Hotmail on his other iPhone, no contacts were there. Then, he noticed his contacts had gone missing from the first iPhone. And here began the battle.


As soon as the first iPhone took in the new password, it saw that there were no contacts on the Hotmail account and deleted them again from the phone (iOS only asks if you want to merge when you enable iCloud contacts and doesn't merge others stored on 3rd-party accounts).


So, we had to erase the phone and restore the backup again and this time make sure we don't enter the new Hotmail password.


Since we don't have a way to move contacts between accounts and they are not locally stored on the phone either, I decided to use a 3rd-party app that saves all the contacts and stores them in a vCard file that is then emailed and can be opened or imported.


We do that (after having to pay 2,99 for the pro version) and send the email to himself.


Nothing. Minutes go by and the email is not sent, it's on the outbox.


We check on the Outlook app - Nothing on the outbox. We check on outlook.com on a desktop version - Nothing.
I try to do the backup and send again - Nothing. The customer, conveniently, doesn't have any other email address.


I try resending from the outbox on the Mail app and... ""Unable to send email, your mailbox is full.""


*headdesk*


I try deleting all drafts, junk and trash - Still not enough and the man had 23000+ unread emails, nevermind the read ones.


At this point, I was already 1h30 past the end of my shift and I gave up. I told him: ""Talk to Microsoft and ask for help to free up space or buy more space on Outlook. Call us as soon as you are able to receive that email with the vCard file.""


*end of act I*


Cue this morning. I hadn't thought about the man when a call comes in. I recognize the name.


""Oh no...""


The case number populates with my notes. It's him again.


*insert GTA meme here*


The man hadn't spoken to us over the weekend and didn't recognise my voice despite us having spoken for 2 straight hours 3 days prior. He still hasn't gotten rid of the clutter on his Hotmail but has now created a Gmail account.


I set up the screensharing on all 3 devices again, open the email that was still on the outbox and sent it to his Gmail. Sent and received, praise be.


Try to open the file directly on the iPad - Nothing. It says it's a vCard file but no options to import.


""I'm pretty sure iOS asks if you want to import contacts when you open a vCard"", I thought innocently.


We set up the Gmail on one of the iPhones and use the native Mail app to open the file - Same thing, no option to import.


I then decided to go to icloud.com on his iPad and import the vCard directly to the server.


We sign in, import the vCard and it imports... 49 contacts out of the hundreds he had.


*headdesk again*


More outside-the-box thinking led to instead import the vCard to Gmail, see what happens and if there's more contacts, export the vCard from there and then import to iCloud.


We go to gmail.com desktop version on the iPad, import the vCard... 600 contacts imported. icloud.com is such a POS of a platform.


Anyway, let's export the vCard. We select to export and then... Nothing. The vCard doesn't go anywhere. It's not saved and iOS doesn't ask where we want to save it. FFS.


The customer then noticed his contacts appearing on his iPhone because the Gmail account was syncing. At that point, I noticed his happiness and told him to connect the Gmail account on the remaining devices and have his contacts sync and just let it be like that. He agreed, and 45 more minutes later, we parted ways.

t3_cgch5b,Prevent_disaster = disabled,"So as previously mentioned, we use $FinalPassword Enterprise extensively. By now, I class it as business critical - I couldn't do my job as a sysadmin without it. Most of our business applications use Google SSO, but for those that don't, $FP is invaluable for its random-generation and automatic save feature. We also use it to share passwords for things like Twitter accounts.

So, after doing a trial of $FP Enterprise in 2018 and being impressed enough to pay for it, I got an invite to a webinar ([I've mentioned this before](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8heeb8/thats_not_really_how_youre_supposed_to_use_a/)) where $FP people outlined the power of Policies. As any good admin knows, being able to enforce policies to everyone in the company is an extremely bulletproof way to avoid problems down the line.

One of the policies I really liked the sound of was the Shared Folders feature. Normally, under $FP (and I'm sure other platforms), users can share passwords directly with each other. This is all fine and dandy, but the critical problem is that the password resides within the original user's account. What happens when the user leaves and their account license is reused? One, two and ... ... poof! $Company forgot $Password!

So the policy exists to force users to share passwords in folders, by disabling direct sharing. By doing so, the password moves from an individual account to the shared folder and is not directly tied to an account. There's also a policy that every shared folder is implicitly shared with an admin. So I happily switched both features on. I keep all my shared passwords in folders (things like CCTV cameras, web UIs for internal devices, those sorts of things) and I thus have granular access control. Everybody wins!

Except...

So last week I get a message from a colleague via our CTO:

&gt;$Colleague: err, did we delete $ExColleague's $FP or something recently? I no longer have the passphrase for the release scripts in my vault

Interesting. I sit with $Colleague to go through what he's trying to find. Sure enough, there's no trace of the password where he expects it. Nor is there any trace at all that I can see as an admin.

$ExColleague left in March. I check through the logs and I deleted his $FP account in April, all routine. $ExColleague also set up the release process $Colleague is trying to use. But if he shared it through $FP, he would have been forced to create the password in a shared folder, so there's no way it would get lost, right?

Right?

Every so often, when I'm in the admin console, I poke into the Shared Folders tab, which shows me what folders are being shared and how many passwords are in them. Mine are all there and have several password entries, as expected. There's a few other shared folders, but some of them are empty. At the time, I never thought much of it - most of what we do is SSO'd after all, so the need to share passwords is quite small. This time I take a more critical eye to it, and then delve into the Policies.

&gt;Policy                                                                          Value  
&gt;  
&gt;Prohibit Sharing Except for Shared Folders    Disabled

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;$me: Oh you have got to be KIDDING ME.

So then things begin to fit into place. I dig into $FP's excellent auditing logs:

&gt;May 3rd 2018: Policy added by $me  
&gt;  
&gt;July 31st 2018: Policy edited by $userID: Enabled = false

Ohhhhh !""£$%\^\*().

When an account is closed, $FP has an annoying habit of deleting all references to the name from the logs and thereafter only referring to it by user ID - so the person who changed the setting has left. Unfortunately there is no easy way to figure out someone's user ID. So I can only go by an assumption - someone who has left, and had admin access to $FP. The only one who fits the bill left last month. They had admin access because they were the person with the credit card.

So here we are. Nothing we can do, the account has long been purged, we've lost contact with $ExColleague and the password is protecting a GPG signing key. So we'll have to generate a new one and go through the same validation hoops. The last time we released something was in January, hence why we didn't notice until now.

I've switched the policy back on but it's not retroactive, so I have unknown shared passwords that can go bye-bye when a user leaves. I just spot-checked and $CTO himself is sharing 20 individual passwords without folders. I now have to check and guide many people through this.

Best part is that I have no clue why $OldAdmin decided to switch the setting off. They never mentioned it, and the only indication was in the audit logs. I never get more annoyed than when I pre-empt something, do something about it and it happens anyway.

t3_cg5hph,But... WHY did you click that?,"One of my biggest clients has two offices: a home office about 10 miles away and a remote office 175 miles away. 

The home office is run like any ""proper"" business of its size: Ubiquiti networking gear, a Windows domain, multiple backups to external hard drives and the cloud, Dell 3060 Micros for the users, Office 365 Business Premium, etc. And I have these users trained pretty well: they're good about rebooting their computers first, about calling me before opening sketchy emails, about writing down (or screencapping) error messages. Pretty much the best you could hope for from non-technical folks.

The remote office, on the other hand, is treated like the red-headed stepchild. They used to get the home office's hand-me-down PCs (when I took over IT in 2004 one user was still using a Pentium 266! No, that's not a joke). They don't have a server 'cos they don't need one. They're using an Archer C9 router 'cos it was cheap and ""good enough"". And since the only user-specific app on their PCs is Outlook, I have them logging in as COMPANYUSER with the same password. The ""same password"" thing was an explicit request of the owner, but the same user was my idea - if someone leaves the company, all I have to do is uninstall Office 365 and OneDrive, disconnect the old O365 account from Windows and reinstall Office 365 and OneDrive for the new employee. It's not perfect by any means, but since the office is a three hour drive (and there's no real reason for them to have individual profiles) it works.

Or, at least, it did. A user left recently, so I removed her Office\OneDrive install and reinstalled it for the new user. It seemed to work fine on my end. Until Thursday, when I got a text from the office manager up there. She said the new user ""couldn't save any files"" and it ""looked like the computer has been wiped!"" She said that she ""needed this fixed ASAP!""

One problem with that office is that its understaffed. More than once its taken a whole day to do a fix an issue that ideally should only take 20-30 minutes... because users will get a customer or phone call, and it'll take them 45 minutes to get back to their computers. Then they'll go to lunch, even if I ask them to wait, 'cos it'll only take a few more minutes if they'll stick around for a couple minutes. So, despite asking for help ""ASAP"", it took 35 minutes to finally get in touch with the office manager.     

I accessed the computer remotely and found Adobe Reader wouldn't save a file because it was locked up. So I ended the task, and noticed the OneDrive wasn't running... in fact, it looked like it had been uninstalled. So I installed it for the new user and set up file protection, because if anyone needs it, it's this office. After that, I asked the office manager (OM) to show me what was wrong.

&gt;OM: ""Well, look at this!"" 

[she opens the Documents folder, which is empty except for the default folders and some RDP files they use to connect to the home office] 

&gt;OM: ""There's NOTHING here! It's like it was wiped! There should be HUNDREDS of documents here! This office DEPENDS on these documents! We are literally DEAD IN THE WATER without them!""

&gt;Me: ""Well, [old user] didn't use the Documents folder. She kept everything on the desktop. Here, look..""

[There are only, like, four folders on the desktop; I open one to reveal *hundreds* of documents and templates; I then open another folder to show OM hundreds *more* documents and templates]

&gt;OM: ""Well, OK. That's a relief! But the computer still won't let us save files!""

[I open Excel, type some gibberish and save the file to the desktop. It works. I open an existing Word doc, type ""THIS IS A TEST"" at the top and save it as EDIT-[FILENAME.DOCX]. That works, too.]

&gt;OM: ""No, not Office! Reader!""

&gt;Me (annoyed at her ""not Office, you idiot!"" tone): ""Why don't you show me the problem.""

She opened Reader, and I watched as a box popped-up that said something like ""We recovered one of your documents from a program crash. Do you want to restore it?"" Before I could even finish reading the textbox, OM clicked NO. She then clicked through the recent items and File &gt; Open dialog. 

&gt;OM: ""See? I spent HOURS working on this PDF with [new user] and now it's GONE. I can't find it ANYWHERE! WHERE IS IT???""

&gt;Me, dumbfounded: ""Why in the world did you click 'No' on that box that popped up when you opened Reader?""

&gt;OM: ""Oh, I never read those things!""

&gt;Me: ""Well, I couldn't read the whole thing since you clicked ""No"" so quickly, but it said that it recovered a document from a crash, and asked if you wanted to restore it. That was almost certainly the document you spent HOURS working on.. and it saved a copy for you.. and you clicked 'No, I don't want that file.' So now it's gone.""

t3_cfy6u9,The ultimate protection for usb sticks. Who needs backups anyway?,"I just remembered this special interaction I've had. It has become my number one tale to scare my users into backing up their files and I thought I'll share it with you. Excuse any grammar errors, english is not my first langauge.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a couple of years ago, I was fresh out of my apprenticeship in my first real job at a big university in Central Europe. My team consisted of 6 people, every one of us has a couple of faculties to support. We also have a help desk, that routes calls from those faculties to the right supporter and that answer the general problems from students.

&amp;#x200B;

At that time, my faculty was the law faculty. Now, law professors are a special breed, on par with doctors in their God complex. But everyone knows the secretaries are the people that actually run this joint and even the profs are scared of angering them.

To make my life easier I made a point to befriend them. This was made easier by the fact that I am their first female supporter and they were so fascinated by this, that they regularly invited me for their daily coffee and cake breaks.

That also meant they sometimes ask me for things that I'm strictly speaking not allowed to provide.

&amp;#x200B;

Enough of backstory, let's get to the story

$me = obviously

$HD = student that works in help desk and routes/screens calls

$favSec = my favorite secretary, was a sweetheart but not very computer savvy. Had to explain her a lot of things again and again, but she reigned in her professor for me, so I didn't mind

$PhD = student working for $favSec and simultaneously working on her dissertation. Not computer savvy either. Manages to hard shutdown her computer during updates EVERY SINGLE TIME.

&amp;#x200B;

It's 1pm, I'm watching the clock tick by and contemplate what I did wrong in my life to end up in the public sector with a boring job that every monkey can do in an infrastructure that is stuck in the 80s.

&amp;#x200B;

The phone rings, a frantic $HD is on the other end

&gt;\&gt; $HD: ""Oh good, you're in. I have $favSec on the phone for you, but she doesn't want to tell me what's the problem. And there is someone crying in the background.""  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;$Me: ""OK, just give me the call, I'll see what they have done now."" - ""Hello $favSec, this is $Me, what can I do for you today?""  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; $favSec: ""Oh thank God, you're in today. I know you're not allowed support private usb sticks, but this is really REALLY important. $PhD can't see her usb stick on the PC anymore.""

The crying in the background get's louder. Please, tell me it's not what I think it is...

I normally would tell them to drop of the usb stick and I'll get to it in the next couple days. But it's a slow day and I think we all know where this story is going.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt; $Me: ""Well, I won't garantuee anything, but I'll come and take a look at it.""  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; $favSec to $PhD: ""Dont worry, $Me is coming and will get it working again.""  
&gt;  
&gt;(Thanks lady, nothing like a little pressure to save the day)

&amp;#x200B;

I inform my boss of the impending fiasco and make my way to the law faculty building. As I enter their floor, I see secretaries like meerkats popping out of their door and just as fast disappearing again. That seems slightly ominous.

I get to the office of $PhD and see $favSec wringing her hands and another student worker consoling a crying $PhD.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt;$Me: ""so, what's the problem exactly?""  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;$PhD: ""I came in this morning, put in the usb stick and I can't see it! It has my dissertation on it!!! I have to submit it next week!!!""  
&gt;  
&gt;Motherf\*\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I take a look at it and sure enough, nothing in explorer but I can see an unidentified mass storage device in device manager.

But surely this is not the only copy of her dissertation. She probably lost like a couple hours if work, but not her whole dissertation. SURELY! Because who would work on a dissertation for a couple of years ond only save it on one usb stick?!

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this idiot did. She worked on it on her private laptop at home, but never saved a copy there. For years she was working on the same document, reading and writing on this usb stick.

She never saved in on another usb, never saved in on a pc directly, never mailed it to herself (*I spend 5 minutes explain to her that mailing it to herself would be a fast and easy way to save it. She did not understand this, to her this would not work and she was stupified I suggested this*), never used a private cloud storage, never used the faculty file share, never used the university's own cloud storage.

&amp;#x200B;

While I was getting all this information from her, I tried everything to access the USB stick, no dice.

&amp;#x200B;

Even $favSec cringed at some of the answers from $PhD. During this $PhD kept getting more and more distressed.

One last try, maybe she just didn't understand my questions for a backup.

&gt;\&gt;$Me: ""so you never saved a copy of this file anywhere else, ever?""  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;$PhD: ""no, why should I?! I never needed to, this usb stick was working perfectly for the last 8 years.""

&amp;#x200B;

Well, yes, it did. Now it doesn't anymore. It was one of the first intenso rainbow usb sticks. Honestly, I was amazed it held for so long, it just reached its EOL with all her writing in this file for years.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt;$Me: ""Have you saved it in ANY other way?""  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; *Now, in my language 'saved' can also be interpreted as 'protected'.*  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;*$PhD stops crying and her eyes light up.*  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; *Hallelujah, we are saved.*

&amp;#x200B;

It was all just a misunderstanding. Of course this 20-something student knows better and backed it up somewhere.

She hold up [this freaking leather pouch](https://www.google.com/search?q=usb+leather+pouch&amp;rlz=1C1CHBD_deDE844DE844&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi48bjW9cXjAhVHxaYKHR2ZBAcQ_AUIEigC&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=578&amp;dpr=1.5#imgrc=AEFNsFvVmveN0M:)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt;$PhD: ""Oh yes! I always protected it with this. Everytime I unplugged the usb, I put in in this. Does this help?“  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;$Me: ""No, unfortunately this does not help…at all…“

&amp;#x200B;

This is when the wailing starts. I'm sitting there, wondering how this is my life. The other student worker proceeds to half drag $PhD out of the office into another one, while $favSec looks at me with wide eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt;$Me: ""I want to make clear, that this is nothing my department could have prevented as she is responsible for her dissertation and we don't support this. We also don't support data recovery as you know. Everything important should be either on file share or on the university cloud.""  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;$favSec: ""Understood, $Me, I make sure nothing falls back in you. Just please see if you can save anything.... I'll go and make a new pot of coffee. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Bless you, $favSec.

It was the truth when I told her we don't recover data. We have backup team for the fileshare and cloud, but desk side support has no tools for data recovery. And everyone knows this. It actually means 99% is saved correctly and the other 1% is on their own. But the crying.... So I consult my boss and my coworkers and try every freeware we can think off. After about 3 hours I actually have a couple of old file version recovered.

Bad news: they are around 5 months old.

&amp;#x200B;

So, after 3 hours and around 3 pots of coffee, $PhD has become slightly manic with a Coffein fueled glimmer in her eyes. I show her the files I recovered, send them to her mail and save them on her work pc and advise her to either buy the full version of the freeware or give it to a data recovery specialist.

&gt;\&gt; $ME: ""Honestly, go with the data recovery. It will cost you, but the probably can save all of it.""  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;$PhD: ""no no, I can do it. No problem. I will just rewrite 5 months of work until my submit date next week. No worries.""  
&gt;  
&gt;*She keeps mumbling while walking to her pc.*

I'm slightly unsettled and just want to get out of her office ASAP.

$favSec gave me some muffins as a payment.

&amp;#x200B;

I get back to my office and find my coworkers on a smoke break. I still can't believe what just happened and tell them about the leather pouch. They were all equally mystified as I was, about how stupid users can be.

&amp;#x200B;

But as I said, it has become a good story to scare users into saving and a great icebreaker when meeting new IT people.

And as far as I know $PhD managed to get an extension on her submit date.

Gets logged in

Me:""Alright sir, could you show me which account you're trying to delete?""

User:""Yes it's this account here."" User hovers mouse over an account with more than 3000$ USD of balance. It's important to note that accounts act as tabs, customers can come in and put items on their accounts, and then come in at a later date and make payments on their accounts to reduce the balance owed. So for this account to have a 3000$ balance means that that account owes 3000.

Me:""Ok Kevin, give me a moment here.""

Me to my supervisor:"" Hey this guy wants to delete an account with 3k on it? No way we are allowed to do that correct?""

Supervisor:""Nah, not without a whole lot of security questions  and documentation to cover ourselves in case of an audit.""

Me to User""You said you name was Kevin? Could I please get your last name and position at the restaurant? ""

User:"" My name is Kevin *******, I am a General Manager.""

Me:""Ok Kevin, what is the reason for deleting this account?""

User:""What's with all these security questions? I shouldn't be getting interrogated. I have a request and it's your job to do it.""


At this point I knew some fishy stuff was going on.

Me:""I apologize Kevin, but I am going to have to discuss further actions with my supervisor as I cannot authorize the deletion of an account.""

It's company policy to not do any actions that could compromise a restaurants profits or cause legal repercussions. This is a huge red flag.

ME to Supervisor:"" So the guys says he's the GM, but this seems a little off to me, he got real defensive when I asked him some questions.""

Supervisor:""Ok let me take a look at what we've got.""

Looks over my notes, we discuss the possibility of fraud. As we are discussing it I hear over my headset: ""F**k this, I can do it myself."" Kevin immediately selects the account and hits delete, hits the confirmation. And boom just like that a owing balance of 3k gone. He immediately hung up afterwards. My supervisor told me to log everything, and be as detailed as possible including time stamps and include the call log. This was forwarded to my boss and later to the restaurant owner who confirmed with us that that account was held by Kevin's close friend. I am not aware of what happened to Kevin but I have my assumptions.

That was my first taste of how awful people are at times. He cost that restaurant 3k. Moral of the story: note down everything no matter how insignificant you think it is, it may very well protect you in the future.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cfs50w,*THUD* *THUD* *THUD*,"Relatively new Reddit lurker, first post. Recently discovered this sub, and thought you might get a quick laugh out of this. I swear this riveting tale is a true story, hand on heart. No TL;DR, read it or not.

So, I work in tech support, and have been for a year and a half, we deal with issues with software on personal phones and computers. This happened straight out of training, just about a month in, when the guides (other employees listening and helping our calls in the beginning) had let go of the reins, and we were taking calls on our own. Still a bit new to procedures, but for the most part, things are going well.

I have a few other friends in tech-support (not the same firm), who sometimes tell me about idiotic or rude callers, fun stories which I sometimes dismiss in my mind, because a few of them sounded exaggerated and embellished. Even after landing this job, I still held on to those beliefs for a while.

""For a while"" lasted until I got this particular caller on the line. This caller is polite, generally likeable, follows exact instructions (important), and just wants her issue resolved. Nothing wrong with that, right? She calls, because in the past week, her phone has been unable to connect or receive calls, no error messages. She is calling from her office phone, making troubleshooting a bit easier.

So, I go through a bit of basic troubleshooting with her.

You know, stuff like ""Is airplane mode turned on?"" (No), ""Does carrier data display websites?"" (Yes), that stuff. We're about halfway down the list of to do things prior to getting her to contact her carrier/Tier 2, when we reach a step I assumed would go by in a jiffy.

No chance.

The step was to simply remove the SIM card, to see if it was okay, and if the gold-plating had fingerprints or anything on it which should not be there. Unlikely, but we do need to check it anyway, and told the caller as much, she complies.

She has one of those phones with the SIM card tray. One opens the slot, pulls out the tray and inserts/removes SIM, reverse process to put it back. Even if you've never seen this exact SIM insertion system in your life, the process is self-explanatory if you've ever owned a cellphone, and this caller had had her phone for a while. It cannot get complicated, it is the simplest thing in the world.

Or so I thought.

She opens the slot, pulls out the tray, removes the SIM. She takes a good hard look at it, cleaning it with a dry cloth for good measure. So far, so good. 

Then I tell her: ""Alright, now please put the SIM back in the phone, and we'll see if anything changes.""

She replies: ""Ok.""

There's a five-second break in the conversation, and just as I am about to ask if she has reinserted her SIM, she asks me this: ""...By the way, should the SIM card be *in* the tray when I put it back in?""

A bit hesitantly, I reply: ""...Yes.""

She replies, without skipping a beat: ""Oh, because I put in the SIM without using the tray, the tray is still on my desk.""

Now it is my turn to have a five-second break in the conversation, as my brain struggles to process and comprehend this new piece of data it has just received, and how ANYONE could actually do that. 

Of course, I don't tell her that, the next words out my mouth is: ""Can you get it out?""

She can not get it out. 

She struggles a bit with the phone, but the SIM is firmly lodged in there, and the callers attempt to pry it out with pointy items and tweezers only pushes it further in, and the SIM gets more and more stuck. Luckily, she did not take her ire out on me, still as polite as ever, never even cursing. Similarly, I kept cool and professional, despite the overwhelming urge to slam my head on my desk.

I know we cannot continue the troubleshooting until we get the SIM out of the phone and back in the way it is supposed to be, as it is rather necessary in order to troubleshoot the whole ""calls will not connect"" issue. I tell the caller as much, and she is understanding of the conundrum.

In the end, we agree that I would provide her with a case number so that she can call us back later, when she has managed to dislodge the SIM. She agrees, and tells me she'll get the phone to an electronic store, and see if they can help her with it, and we agree she should call back later, no hard feelings.

The last thing I hear before the line drops, is:

**\*THUD\* \*THUD\* \*THUD\***

And I realize she is slamming her phone on the desk, not her office phone, but the one she has been calling about, in an attempt to dislodge the SIM the only way she could think of, brute force. (Pro-tip, fancy smart-phones does not deal well with being repeatedly slammed against a desk.)

Never did learn what the end result of the case was, but I did learn to properly use baby-steps with other callers going forward, and got my very own ""inept caller"" story to share with friends.",talesfromtechsupport

I type ""show environment"" and everything is normal. I check the logs for alarms on the VGW and the layer 2 switch the VGW is connected to and there isn't a single issue with anything. I tell her, ""Ma'am, I'm not finding anything out of the ordinary. The fan may get a little louder if the temperature in the room is a bit higher than normal.""

She says, ""Well, the increased noise is disruptive to our work environment. We can't work with this noise. Can't you hear it in the background? I'm standing next to it."" I can here dozens of fans going off but, most importantly, I can hear other people on phone calls in the background. 

""Ma'am, it's not unusual for a fan to get louder if an area is hotter."" She says, ""Well, I think a technician needs to look at this because this noise is louder than usual and it should not get any louder."" I'm INSTANTLY irritated by this as she's demanding a technician for this issue. I tell her that I'm setting up the dispatch as she asked. 

I submit the ticket to the tech and he doesn't respond (I already know why). I reach out to dispatch to make sure they are aware. Dispatch looks at the ticket and I say, ""Yes, you read it right: no alarms, no abnormalities, no historical or current logs for issues."" They let the tech know and he doesn't respond. I tell dispatch to just let him get there whenever. 

He contacts me and is like, ""Are they serious?""
I tell him, ""I couldn't make up a better story if I submitted this on LSD and bath salts.

He gets there and doesn't find any issue ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT THEY ARE LEAVING THE EQUIPMENT DOOR OPEN TO COOL OFF THE REST OF THE OFFICE!!!

t3_cfowve,Third Party IT and the Concept of Electricity,"I've got two quick stories from my current position as a technician for a small ISP. This time, dealing with some of our customers' IT people and their understanding of electricity. One of these stories is a few months old. The other from just this morning. Both of these customer are among our largest, each with employee counts in the hundreds.

&amp;#x200B;

**Story 1**

A while back, we got a call from one of our major customers. They had experienced a power outage, but their backup power had come online and their internet was still down. Of course, the first thing I check is our monitoring system to see the status and history of their ONT. This ONT showed a warning that it was on battery power. In this state, the ONT will disable all services other than phones, in case emergency calls need to be made while the power is out and to keep the ONT online as long as possible. I asked the tech that had called us to check on the ONT and confirm that it's actually connected to power. The tech hangs up to go do so.

&amp;#x200B;

About 20 minutes later, I get a call on my direct line from the same tech. Not only did the ONT have no power, but the entire networking room lacked power. They had forgotten to connect the circuit that room was on to their backup power grid when it was put in.

&amp;#x200B;

**Story 2**

Just this morning I took a call from another one of our major customers. They had experienced a power outage earlier in the morning, but now that the power was back on, they still had no internet service and were wondering why this was the case. The tech stated that it was important that they get internet online again soon in order to continue their work. Our monitoring system said that their ONT was online and that it had gone down around the time of the power outage. Story checks out. However, the port that their firewall is connected to showed no DHCP leases (static IPs are also shown in this section of our interface), indicating that it was either not powered or had failed to grab an IP after booting, as it may have booted faster than our ONT did after the power returned.

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing I suggest to the tech to try is to reseat the ethernet cable in the firewall or to reboot the firewall to try to convince it to grab it's assigned static IP address, but, of course, he's offsite and is 20 minutes away. He'll go onsite and try that right away!

t3_cfnw57,The Printer II,"TL;DR: Lady destroys her printer due to an almost-correct troubleshooting run.

&amp;#x200B;

One day my girlfriend met a very kind elderly woman in a Cafe. Let's name this woman Lost Lady since she is the only person I know that is both a great scientist and completely lost if the subject isn't pure theoretical science from her field.  Up to the point that she treats Nigeria spam serious, doesn't fall victim to it (as she isn't greedy) but instead finds a person who is happy that someone is willing to listen about the problems of life in Nigeria. She even tried to run a campaign to get one of the candidates for the elections for the Major of the town in order to change things in Nigeria.

Turns out she is in need of a printer. And that she is big friends with Great Professor. Both big Red Flags as this professor asked me to repair an Cockroach-infected printer from a friend. As a popular supermarket happens to sell an all-in-one inkjet with low power consumption (and therefore low appeal for cockroaches, lest they still exist in her flat) and Lost Girl has no car my girlfriend asks me if I help transporting the thing and to install the drivers.

&amp;#x200B;

The woman has DSL (which isn't bad). A Router the TelCo has delivered with the password being identical to the network name and a Windows XP Computer that is slow, because constantly swapping =&gt; If the printer will work, then by pure chance. Luckily I have brought my Netbook (which was my only Computer at that time) so I can prepare all the downloads needed on an USB stick. Whilst I am installing the two women discuss about a letter Lost Lady got that states she has won ONE MILLION DOLLARS: Lost Lady wants to call the (very long foreign) number on the envelope as even as she doesn't remember to have played in the lottery: What if she still has won? And that she cannot just throw away the letter. What would the other people living in her house think (?). All the time I fight with my Netbook's Touchpad bug: The thing works fine unless you fail to touch it for more than a minute. In this case it increases the sensitivity to a point that it seems to spot movements more than a centimeter away and invents random clicks. Most tools that suppress taps while typing seem to tell the touchpad to disable taps. Which this specific touchpad ignores. But in the end the printer works and we go home.

Several calls follow, months apart, about adjusting the print-heads after changing the ink. Then in a really busy time for me she calls me and tells that there is a paper jam she cannot resolve. Two weeks later I am finally  in our town again, turn on the printer and instead of the complex print head and paper feed handling sound it just gives a uniform hum. I open the device and the print head is missing. Lost lady says that she had found out that this was the part of the printer that always hit the jammed paper so she hat taken it out. And thrown it away.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cf9tar,A user reported me today for being rude.,"Quick back story, Fairly important User calls and is having an issue printing from one specific program. She can print just fine otherwise. I tell her that I do not have access to fix the issue that she is having and give her the phone number for the software team that can. (Our line is more for hardware and general windows issues, any issues with in house programs we use have to go through another group)

She calls back 20 minutes later saying that no one is answering the phone when she calls claiming that I must have given her the wrong number. I confirm with her the phone number I gave her was the right one. (had her repeat back the number I gave her to make sure she has the right one and it was). They just werent asnwering the phones. She calls them again and same thing. She calls back and asks why I cant just fix her issue. And I explain again that I am unable to fix her issue as I do not have the access nor the training required on how to fix the program. She needs to go through the people that administrate the program to fix the issue.

Fast forwards to the 5th time she calls I am starting to get a bit annoyed at the situation. Its apparently my fault that they arent picking up their phones and that I need to fix her issue right now. 

Now I would like to think I have good patience when it comes to problem users. I try to put myself in their shoes and understand that they dont know all the technical details that we know. But when I encounter a user that just will not accept the fact that I am unable to solve their issue needless to say I get a little upset. At this point I am running out of nice ways to say I have no way to fix this issue, please contact the support number I gave you. If they arent picking up there really isnt anything that I can do. If they arent picking up for you, then they certainly wont be picking up for me. I dont know why they arent answering their phones its a completely separate department that we have very little to do with each other outside of making sure users can open up the software teams programs.",talesfromtechsupport

I forgot my pin within literal seconds and now I can't access my phone. This is your fault.""","I feel like the title serves as a pretty good tl;dr for the situation, but essentially, our corporate mobile software forces the user to enroll an MDM profile on their phone. It comes with some minor security requirements, the most major one being that it requires a 6-digit PIN for your phone's unlock screen, if you currently have a 4-digit one. 

Well, this user was really upset about this. She says it's ridiculous that she has to change her password, despite our company being hit with a major breach a few months ago. She doesn't care, this is about her convenience, not about the sensitive corporate data that's housed on her phone. 

Anyway, she finally manages to change her lock screen PIN, and I shit you not, literally forgets it seconds later. Her having the memory of a goldfish and being completely unable to adapt to any sort of change in her work environment is now our fault, and she goes to complain to cybersecurity about how I, the lowly level 2 support agent, made her change her lock screen, and not, you know, the management software that she was free to opt out of at any time.

t3_cffa0n,Client Calls Me A Joke,"This is one that 2 years and 2 jobs later still irks me to no end. Back when I was working for the MSP I mentioned, the staff was myself &amp; a co-worker (!CO), as well as the owner and 1 or 2 on-call contractors we would escalate tickets to and the owner (!OWN), so !CO &amp; I were basically Tier 1 &amp; 2. I'd been there a few months at this point and had helped this company ($C) in question a number of times.

&amp;#x200B;

One day one of their employees ($E) call and calls for an issue with her Outlook display font changing to a different, smaller one, which didn't look good on her screen. I fix it up, she tests it out &amp; is on her way. A few days later, $E calls back with the same issue. Fixed it and she was good. It seemed like every 2-3 days for 3 weeks $E was calling in about this. Every time she called, you can sense she was getting more &amp; more frustrated that it wasn't getting fixed &amp; I agreed with her. Kept searching ticket history, knowledge articles, Google, nothing would give a long-term fix. !CO was normally at other client's site when these calls came in and after the 5th or so call, I finally got a chance to explain everything to him to pick his brain, but he was as perplexed as me.

&amp;#x200B;

She calls again and luckily she gets !CO this time. He tries everything he can think of and anything not posted in my past tickets, but sure enough she calls in a few days later as it returned. One day !CO is actually over at the $C site and checks on her computer too see if the settings we're seeing on the remote tool are different then what she is seeing, but it's the same.

&amp;#x200B;

$E finally stops calling after nearly a month, so I'm not sure if she just gave up or what. A few weeks later, !OWN stops in after visiting them. He tells me that the client has requested that I no longer work on their account since $E complained that I wasn't getting her issue fixed and said I was a joke of a technician. !CO was right there when !OWN was explaining this and stood-up for me saying if he reviewed the ticket history for $E, he would see that it's not because of lack of effort and both of us worked on her case, not just me. Didn't matter to !OWN, if $C said jump, he would say how high &amp; I was to never work on their account again during the rest of my time there.

&amp;#x200B;

As I was having my exit interview, !OWN asked if there was anything he could do to make the company better. I told him that he needs to stand-up for his employees more and not just cave in if a client says something. I also told him was, when they said I was a joke, he should've said ""Don't talk about my employees like that because your insulting me as much as you are them. Let me look into the case in question &amp; I'll get back to you.""

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to !CO a few months after I left and he said that !OWN never changed, not that I expected it. Moral of the story, have your employees backs and they'll go the extra mile for you, not bail as quickly as they can.

t3_cffy65,Did You Even Look?,"Hiya TFTS, its been a while since my last post. Long story short there is my last hell desk fired me (laughed all the way to unemployment that went on too long) and have since been at such greener pastures I honestly haven't had a story worth sharing (seriously, any 'bad' user apologizes shortly after and/or brings treats)

This story is like 25% $user and 75% coworker ($CW) headache. And I'll be $Me, as if you needed that explained.

To set the table we're a large company with a sprawling multi-building campus in a downtown area. Due to cost of that the majority of IT was moved to a satellite office a few years ago with a small desk kept in the main building downtown for in person issues. When I say small think the repair desk at your average small cell phone store staffed by the Executive Support tech and a tech rotating from the satellite office every couple months. I'm that rotating tech at present, and I'm the primary support for the 2k+ people on this campus as most don't bother with the help desk line even when trivial.

In this case $User came by to schedule a time to upgrade their computer to Windows 10. Its gonna be needed soon anyways so I'm glad to help, and $User even planned it for a day they're on PTO! That kinda forethought would deserve a prize normally, until they get into the specifics. 

Its a desktop that even they don't know why they need it over a laptop.

They also want a bevy of applications installed that generally can't be done without being on their profile, or we don't have (like a 6 generation old version of Firefox that they still think is needed for a webapp that we've repeatedly proven isn't) So I explain this to her as clearly as I can. Its clear its not understood, but I do my best to get it noted that it was explained and move on with my life.

A few days later $User drops off the computer. I notice it booting up slow so I open it up and find they're still rocking a 3.5"" platter drive. So I sigh and back it up, then swap them for an extra SSD for my own sanity in copying the data. I image it to Windows 10 and the company policy, set the user with the needed permissions, copy over their backup, and even give them current Firefox out of the goodness of my heart, or to at very least limit the complaints later.

$User's colleague picks it up since they were out. I tell them again about the software and that the backup was copied but $User needs to login and call the Help Desk to merge it with the profile once her profile downloads from the server. And all is right with the world...or so I thought.

A couple days later $User comes back by.

&gt;$User: Hey me! So I called the help desk and they asked me who upgraded it to Windows 10. Also, I didn't see our old Firefox on there and they couldn't find my email archives

&gt;$Me: *Eye twitches a bit* They asked who at the downtown office upgraded the computer? The Help Desk knows we're the only technichians here...but let's get back to that. I told you about the Firefox, we don't have that version on file and it shouldn't be needed. As for the Archives, they should all be there. Please call the Help Desk again and if they have any issue with finding them please let them know that the Tech Desk did the reimage and ask us if they have an issue.

&gt;$User: *Eyes glassed over a bit* Oh, umm, ok. I can do that. And you said tell them the tech place?

&gt;$Me: The Tech Desk downtown, at the Main building. They'll know it.

&gt;$User: Ok...sure, thanks!

And with that $User walked off, and I again thought all was right. And it was. For another 2 days at least. Then I get a message from $CW

&gt;$CW: Hey $Me!, Do you know $User?

&gt;$Me: Hi $CW, yeah I do. I reimaged her computer a couple days ago. Even upgraded the drive.

&gt;$CW: Great! Because I can't find her archives anywhere! Do you still have her backup?

&gt;$Me: I still have her backup, and her original 3.5"" drive with pretty much all of her data possible on it. But I'm sure I moved over the archive. Have you checked all the backup and AppData?

&gt;$CW: I have, I swear. I just want to be able to close this ticket. Can you check the backup?

&gt;$Me: *Sigh*

So I go and grab the backup drive and plug it into my computer. As I do so I remote into the computer with /C$/ to move the data. As I do I see the archives are clearly in the Outlook Files folder in the backup. I also see on the user's drives that $CW hadn't deleted the ""$User.backup"" profile I copied over. I take a look inside and there are all the backups

&gt;$Me: *Facepalm so hard that the Exec Support guy looks up concerned* Hey $CW, its definitely on the backup drive, but its also on the computer. In the Outlook Files from the ""$User.backup"". Looks like you didn't ensure the whole thing copied over.

&gt;$CW: Oh, wow! That's great! I didn't think to check the backup on the computer 

&gt;$Me: You don't say? *Further plans for the happy hour when this day is done* Glad to help $CW

t3_cf808n,The curse of the standby laptop (Unsolvable Problem!),"Hi TFTS! I posted quite a while ago but this one I feel is worthy for your reading pleasure. (Hence the Unsolvable Problem name - big payoff at the end!)


Background: So I am a technician that works for a company that specializes in electricity. We primarily design and manufacture Earth fault protection equipment for the mining industry, municipalities, rail, medical etc. The market at the moment is struggling and my company is also struggling so I thought instead of having our CTO do the IT stuff (which takes a lot of time due to his real work load) I would help him with it. Now I am the electrical technician as well as the IT guy.


We always bought Dell laptops for the after sales service they give. With new office employees and the low funds, our previous (not with us anymore) IT guy bought Asus Laptops. These laptops HDD's tended to fail after 2 years and slowly but surely I would just buy and swap them out with 250GB SSD's when the inevitable occurred. To date, 4 out of the 5 Asus laptops HDD's have failed within 2 years. I know it's not Asus themselves, rather the cheap HDD's they put in these laptops. These laptops are office laptops and stay in office, so little to no abuse on them.


Queue our MD's PA who has a Asus. I already swapped her to a SSD. She complains her PC screen randomly shuts down and she has to press a button to get it back again. This goes on for a while and its extremely difficult to recreate. I check all the power settings as well and later outright disable all power saving features. The issue is still ongoing but I try every tip and trick Google and I can think of. Shortly after we finally move to a Domain and I have to redo all user profiles for application to the Domain. I tell her I could format the entire PC and start fresh and also put her on the Domain, then just add her files again from backup (I explain to her this effectively eliminates the software side of things , thereafter we can start looking at hardware). She says great she is off for a week in future and I agree to redo the machine. I wanted to do it this way just to make sure the laptop had no weird windows settings on that was screwing with her. She also had a Win10 Home install and not an Enterprise Win10 so it was perfect time for me to start from the beginning and do everything my way and not the previous IT guy's way (which had no way).


I format and install and for a week this laptop does not recreate the screen switching off bug. Next week goes by and I give it back. Over the course of the week the laptop screen dies even more. I am setting up external screens but still. It gets to a point where the MD is up in arms and asking me what is the solution? At this point I am so frustrated with the laptop (and the HDD's failing) that I just want to buy her a new one and send this laptop to a repairs place. He says go ahead but get it fixed she needs to work. I decide to take one final look at the laptop.


I tell her to start working while I sit next to her and just observe. Sure enough the screen goes off and comes back on. Eventually I can hear that the entire machine is switching itself off (Fans and all). The penny hasn't dropped yet but its edging to the ledge. She begins again and surely the machine shuts down. I start to press hard on every single key on the keyboard and all around. I'm thinking the keyboard is shorting on the motherboard (or something is) and the laptop goes into protection mode. When I touch it the laptop doesn't bat an eye - all business. This woman is literally hated by this laptop and the penny is tripping on the edge. She starts again and the laptop switches. This problem is literally with her. I tell her to use her left hand to type. Laptop says NO. I tell her use her right hand. Laptop is a happy camper. Finally the penny drops, I see she has long sleeves on and ask her to roll them up. What do I see? She has a smartwatch on her left arm. Smartwatch off please. Start typing. Laptop loves her and graces her with more than 10 seconds of screen time. 


FINALLY get to the cause: She had a smartwatch with a small strap that had a magnetic lock. This magnet was resting on the laptop at the exact spot that would trigger the magnetic switch of the laptop (which says to the laptop the screen has closed) and the laptop would go into sleep mode. I kid you not. A month of frustration was literally the laptop thinking she was closing its lid and it was happily sleeping for her. Lets just say the amount of mind blown was epic, lots of high fives and MD happy he can get work out of her and not spend money.

It’s a mind boggling ticket really, as the issue is always the same. $Ow tells of a flickering screen that cuts in and out frequently, and that he needs it done ASAP as he needs to get his work done by noon.

We’ve previously fixed it by reinstalling drivers and whatnot, as $Ow has a thunderbolt dock that constantly has a USB-C conflicts with his monitors and laptop. 

$Cw and I head over to try and fix it for good.

$Cw: Hey $Ow, hows it’s going?

$Ow: Pretty good except for my stupid screen. Hopefully you guys can fix it this time, it’s going crazy and I just don’t know what to do anymore.

$Me: We’ll see what we can do. I take it the usual is happening?

$Ow: Yeah pretty much, it’s seems to have calmed down now.

$Cw proceeds to do the usual driver fix, only for it to do absolutely nothing.

$Me: Maybe it’s not the drivers?

$Cw: Have you dropped your monitor or hit it with anything lately?

$Ow: Nope, just moved those thick cables at the back so I had more room.

$Cw and I both peer around the corner only to see the display port cables contorted and almost flattened between $Ow’s desk and the wall.

(Commence internal screaming)

$Cw: I think I see the issue. Can you go back and grab a new cable?

$Me (not remembering I don’t have my key card): Yeah sure!

I ran back to our little office space and grabbed a new cable, only to trap myself as our “IT room” is secured, and my supervisor had let me in through one of the glass doors while he was leaving, but left before I could get through the other. 

There I was, realizing I was a complete moron for not sleeping earlier, forgetting my keys, and the worst part; leaving my phone inside the secured area. 

Long story short, I spent around 20 minutes staring at my phone through a glass door hoping $Cw would come get me. 

Eventually he did after realizing what I’d done (I swear he’s telepathic, super great guy) and we did get the cable to $Ow, and showed him how to move the cables without breaking them.

TL;DR I forgot my keys due to lack of sleep, and it bit me in the ass. User squished cables for room and broke them, then repeatedly reported a flickering screen with no fix.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ceswjy,I don't think you know what cancel means.,"Since I have been dealing with users less and less over the years i don't have as many funny user stories like i used to.   
However some of my team members still deal with them on a day to day basis.  Here is a back and forth that one of my team members had with a user that was trying to look at a vendors presentation with the vendor onsite.  

&amp;#x200B;

Panicked lady:  ""WE HAVE A VENDOR UP HERE WHO NEEDS TO CONNECT TO THE PROJECTOR CAN YOU COME UP RIGHT NOW AND HELP US??????""  


SupportGuy:  ""Yeah sure ill be right up""  
""Wait.....""What kind of display options does the vendors laptop have? Like Display port, HDMI, VGA?""  


Panicked lady:  ""......Its a Dell....""

  
SupportGuy:  ""Right right, but what kind of display options does it have, like HDMI, VGA,..."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Vendor:""No worries man I have a dongle we just need a hook in place apparently""  


So i head up there to help out  
This particular room they are using is NOT made for vendor presentations. This room is meant for team building and internal training use only.  
so the only way to connect him in is to unplug the current PC and use that VGA all the way in the back corner for his laptop  
so as i am explaining this I think to myself, ""Man it would be a lot easier if he just sent the powerpoint to one of our ladies here in an email and they pulled it up on this PC but......whatever  
and right on queue the vendor goes 

&amp;#x200B;

Vendor:  ""This seems wrong....didnt I send all of you the powerpoint in email?  I feel like last time we did this it was super easy....why cant we just do that again?""   


Panicked lady:  "".....yeah we can do that....BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT IF YOU HAVE OUTLOOK 2010 OR LATER IT WONT WORK ON HERE SINCE THIS PC ONLY HAS 2007""  


SupportGuy:  ""No.....that's not correct...""  


Panicked lady:  ""YEAH THIS COMPUTER WONT EVEN LET ME LOG IN SINCE MY EMAILS BEEN UPGRADED!!!""  
SupportGuy:  ""Go ahead and launch outlook for me...""  
\*clicks outlook\*

\*pulls up sign in dialog box\*

\*she clicks cancel and then program terminates\*

Panicked lady:  ""SEE I TOLD YOU IT WOULDNT WORK""

SuppotGuy: ""Hold on hold on.....go back to outlook and click it again for me...""

&amp;#x200B;

\*Clicks outlook again\*

SupportGuy: ""Woah woah woah! Dont click cancel! Go ahead and enter your username and password for me""  
\*enters username and pw\* 

  
\*outlook opens with email of vendor at the top\*

t3_cevjzc,“Do my PC first IM THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON HERE“,"i posted this on r/ EntitledPeople and they said you might like it as well, i hope it is okay to share this at two different subreddits:

First of English is not my first language, so please forgive me for some mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

So this story comes from my job. I work at IT and repair/migrate/install PCs etc. So this one time I had to migrate a whole office with 13 Pcs from Windows 7 to Windows 10.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the cast:

&amp;#x200B;

EOW: Entitled office worker

OB: Office Boss

ME: Me

&amp;#x200B;

I went to this office at 8 o’clock and was greeted by the receptionist (EOW). My first impression did not fool me: she looked like a typical Karen.

I greeted her and told her who I am.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hi I’m Nerofuia I come from a generic IT company, I’m here to migrate your PCs.

EOW: Good morning (she stretched that for no reason) I can't help you, you have to wait until the boss is here.

Me: No Problem ill wait.

&amp;#x200B;

So I sat down in the waiting area until the Boss arrived 15 minutes later.

I introduced me again and the conversation went like this:

Me: Hi I’m Nerofuia I come from a generic IT company, I’m here to migrate your PCs.

CB: Hi, didn’t EOW showed you my office, I told her you should start with my pc.

EOW: I did. He said he wants to wait until you are here.

CB: oh okay no Problem

(I was new at the job and didn’t want to escalate the situation so I let it slip)

Me: So I start with your office? Could you show me where it is?

CB: EOW will show you, I have to go to a meeting I will be back in 2 hours, It would be nice If I can work again then.

Me: oh no problem.

(A usual migration will take depending on the hard drive 1-1:30h if I’m fast)

The boss left and I was alone with EOW.

Me: Could you show me where the boss’s office is mam?

EOW: you should do my PC first, he won’t be back for like 2 hours and I have work to do.

Me: one PC will take nearly 2 hours and he told me to do his fist.

EOW: bullshit you IT guys just work slowly!

ME: No, sometimes we have to wait for the PC before we can proceed.

EOW: Fine! The boss’s office is locked. I’ll give you the key when I can work again.

(I was so done at this point but I had to remain friendly because I did not want to lose my job)

Me: Mam, I can try to do both PCs parallel, but you have to open the boss’s office, please.

EOW: NO! I. HAVE. WORK. TO. DO. Do my PC first.

&amp;#x200B;

She went loud, nearly screaming.

&amp;#x200B;

There was nothing I could do. So before I do nothing I started with her PC and the whole time she was standing right behind me and complaining that this is taking too long.

If an IT guy is fixing your PC and its taking longer PLEASE don’t do this!

So I was nearly finished with her PC and the boss arrived.

&amp;#x200B;

OB: Oh hey, you are already on the second PC?

Me: No…

Then EOW interrupted me.

EOW: NO! he did my PC first. And he is working sooo slow. If he wasn’t so slow both our PCs would be ready.

I was shocked, she SAW me working and SAW that I could not work faster.

OB to me: I told you, you should start with my PC, why didn’t you do that?

Me: OB told me to do her PC first.

EOW: NO! HE IS LYING!

Me: No, I’m not. She told me that your office is locked and she wouldn’t open it until she can work.

OB: My office is not locked. EOW is that true?

EOW was so entitled that she didn’t think I would tell her boss the truth.

She didn’t say a word.

I on this point was sure I would lose my job and was shaking.

OB in a louder angrier tone: is that true?

&amp;#x200B;

To my surprise, she said yes!

OB told me where his office is located and told me to go up and begin with my work.

I went as fast as I could.

I heard them arguing loudly but was not able to hear exactly what they said.

I was there two more days and she didn’t talked to me one single word.

&amp;#x200B;

Half a year later, I went there a second time and was greeted by a nice young woman at the reception.

I don’t know if she was fired or simply not there this day, but I like to think, that she got fired.

&amp;#x200B;

t3_cez70t,"""Their files are WHERE?!?""","This is one that is just unfolding, but my boss literally hit his head against the wall about it.  
We recently acquired about a dozen clients from a guy who had started his own MSP, but got in over his head and wanted out.  
We've been doing a lot of cleanup because he wasn't the best about following standard operating procedures, and this new one is a nightmare.  
One of the new clients had a host server die on them.  We got it back in house, repaired it, and recovered the VMs from backup.  But then the clients couldn't find any of their file shares.  
&gt;Coworker: Where are the host backups?  
&gt;Me: Host backups?  Why would we need those?  
&gt;Coworker: All their file shares were on their host.  
&gt;Me: The file server?  That VM should have been backed up.  It wasn't?  
&gt;CoWorker: No, their file shares are on the host.  
&gt;Me: WHAT?!?    

Shortly after, while in the systems of another of these new clients, I saw the same thing, a drive map to \\\HostServer\FileShare.

t3_ceyoxo,Reading and comprehension is obviously not a skill required to be a Really Important Guy!,"A recent delve into the perils of remote support.

Sometimes, I have absolutely no doubt about the old adage about the crap floating to the top in any pool being accurate...

Last night, I get an out of hours email (support hours are generally 7 am to 7 pm, but we've got overseas users who we watch out for if we're still awake)

**User:** Please install $software_suite on my PC. We have purchased a license for it.

*sigh*. OK, he's kinda a medium fish in a small pond who is prone to arcing up if he's not pandered to with sufficient lesse majeste`, so despite it not really being a major issue, I'll do it since I haven't gone to bed yet.

**HeadAche:** Hi $user. Please download the installer and save it on your desktop and let me know your PC name, and I'll remote in and install it for you.

Our users do NOT have admin rights to their PC's - there's an agent which ""whitelists"" approved software so they can install it without admin credentials, but any software which isn't on the list needs someone with admin rights to install it. $software_suite wasn't in the whitelist.

Our remote access solution identifies PC's by their name - so accessing one is a matter of searching for the computer name. All staff know how to find their PC name - it's part of their induction.

**User:** Yes, I've downloaded the installer and saved it on the desktop

Freddie Uncle Charlie Katie. Did you miss the bit about the PC name?

**HeadAche:** That's great, but I need to know your PC name

Radio silence for 30 minutes or so.

**User:** Can you advise when you will install the software? I've downloaded it and saved it on my desktop like you asked.

Freddie Uncle Charlie Katie squared.

**HeadAche:** Yes, I know that, but I NEED TO KNOW YOUR COMPUTER NAME

**User:** The installer name is XXXX. I really need this software, can you please let me know when you will install it

At this point, I'm ready for bed and quite over this guys inability to read and comprehend what I'm asking

**HeadAche:** Well, since you seem incapable of giving me the information I need to know, and it's now pushing 11 pm, likely tomorrow, because I'm going to bed. I've asked you twice for your computer name. Your induction says when you log this kind of issue you must provide your computer name, and shows you how to find it. Send me your computer name and leave your PC on at the end of the day and I'll do it in the morning.

And with that, I logged off and went to bed.

Anyone wanna take a guess at the result the next morning? if you guessed ""No answer"", you win the bonus prize.

**NB:** For anyone asking why I didn't just search for his PC - we have over 1000 connected to the remote portal, and the names are an alpha numeric string which has no relation to the user - and which I have no means of looking up.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cex8mx,Surely it's on putpose at this point,"One of the roles my team fills is supporting the applications for Contact Centres. This ticket has gone on for a couple weeks now, so the actual exchanges are days a part. This is mostly due to the user being a overnight worker and our own night staff not understanding why this user still has issues.

Slightly more background. To log in as a contact centre agent, they need to enter their username, password, and application they are connecting to (ie phone).

Ticket comes in. ""User was working last night and was unable to log inti the system. They have screenshotted the error message and forwarded it on"". I open the screenshot. Big error message saying ""Cannot find application. Please check details and try again"". Just below this is ""Application: phone2"".

Me: Hey Team, user has entered the application name wrong. It should say phone, not phone2. 

I close the ticket. 2 minute job. User error. Done. 

Nope. Next morning the ticket is back. ""User is still unable to log in and has entered application name as phone correctly. Screenshot attached"". New screenshot. New error message. Just as obvious. ""Invalid username or password. Please check details and try again."" Now a detail I missed previously. Usernames in this software are case sensitive. No idea why, but they are. User has typed in 'USERNAME' but needs all lowercase. I assume most users don't know this, heck even I find it stupid. Alas, I reply.

Me: User has entered username as: 'USERNAME' but the application requires lowercase, ie. 'username'.

User isn't actually schedule again til the weekend, but the next Monday the ticket is back again. ""Still not working. User has tried everything [doubt that] and is still getting errors. At this point, the user has been unable to login for 2 weeks. We have escalated this ticket. Please check your application and configurations to fix this"". 

Ah yes, typical response we get from customers (note the customers go through their own service desk which then forwards issues to us). I check the newest screenshot and they have username: 'Username'. I quickly double check my previous email and see I had in fact typed mine as ALL lowercase. Phew. I go into the config and apply a temp password for the user so I can login as them. I screenshot the login page with all the correct details, and then again with the logged in application. I then attach these to the email and send it back. At this point I'm quite annoyed thst they are escalating a ticket that is clearly user error. This is where I stop being polite with my emails.

Me: ""User continues to type in details incorrectly. This is USER ERROR. Attached are screenshots where I have tested the user's correct log in details. As previously stated, user needs to enter username in ALL LOWERCASE"".

At this stage the user is off until the end of he week again so I haven't heard back yet. But 2 weeks of typing in your details wrong. At this point they are either taking the piss, or complete morons. My money is on the latter.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_ceu2rr,But I need my old computer,"So we are doing some OS upgrades and there are two machines in a department. One had a larger multi-terabyte hard drive on it that store a lot of archived images and the other a similar drive with multiple videos on it. The picture ""archive"" has several years worth of photos but then they are taken off to CD or DVD for further archiving for several more years. The picture archive computer had Photoshop and etc to edit pictures and the video machine had Premiere and etc to edit videos. 

After talking with the manager and the digital editor we combined the two roles into one machine. Combined all of the drives and programs onto the new machine with the upgraded OS. The digital editor was more of a camera guy than a computer guy so I assured them that this would work.

Two weeks later the digital editor calls me and says ""What am I going to do I need my old machine back!!""

Me: Why?

Editor: Because we archive all of these files to disk after so many years and now how am I supposed to do that?

Me: There is a DVD burner on the new machine.

Editor: Yes, but I need my old machine.

Me: Why? The new machine can do that.

Editor: What new machine? 

Me: The new machine that we put in place. The video/picture editing machine? The machine on the desk beside you. Ten feet away from you.

Editor: Nervous laughter. Yeah ok. Thanks.

I honestly just think his brain short circuited or something and chaulked it up to another crazy day in technology when 10 minutes later guess who walked in my office.

Editor: OK I need your help that new machine will NOT read this disk. You said it had a DVD drive and this is an old CD from 2004 so this will not work. I tried.

Me: Let me see....

As we walked to his desk, I looked at the disk seeing smudges all over it like the last user used it as a Frisbee after eating a New York deep dish pizza. I pointed this out and using the clean handkerchief in my pocket cleaned it off as best I could. Popped it in the drive and the file explorer popped right up to list the contents.

Bit of backstory. This is a business in the healthcare field who has 4 locations, 3 are practices and one is a call center/admin area, that each use a separate  VDI specific to each site I set up for them to connect to each location and work from there remotely. Scheduling, notes, billing etc. They need local database access so they remote into the VDIs yada yada.

I get a frantic call from OM 
OM: “Hey we took this workstation from location A and need it set up at Location B right now to connect to %MedicalSoftware% database! It’s not installed on this computer!”

Me: ok well that’s not a problem let me remote in real quick and start the install.

OM: ok great thanks *hangs up*
  
I think nothing special these guys move PCs all the time god knows why, but they’re good clients who are usually receptive to our IT best practices advice and the doctors are good guys. I carry on with the work.

I finish the install and reboot the machine, upon reboot I log into %MedicalSoftware% and send off a message saying to OM that’s it’s good to go.  Log out and wait for the user to sign on. I see HYG now entering her credentials, but she stops half way through, and opens a VDI access shortcut on her desktop to the very same location she’s physically in.

I call in to the main line and ask for HYG.

Me: hey I noticed you’re using your remote access here as well, but the software is installed locally, so you don’t really need to use this connection.

HYG: oh I just needed this PC moved here so I would have my bookmarks with me. (Mind you, these guys are on Gsuite and all use chrome with sync)

Me: so.. you guys didn’t actually need this workstation to move locations?

HYG: what do you mean?

I proceed to show her that she can just login to her Company Gmail and all her bookmarks appear in chrome. She’s all wide eyed and mystified. 

I spend about 30 minutes trying to make sure they won’t get charged for an additional license and carry on with my day.

t3_cetl4v,"Wait, you only used what was in the box ?","Hello there, so as I read through this subreddit I ended up recalling some stories from when I was in TechSupport and thought it would be nice to share.

&amp;#x200B;

This happened while I was on an internship in the deployment department of a quite sizeable company.

My job was basically to setup computers/printers to connect to our network and ship them while also answering to level 2 support request that involved hardware (failing drives, need more RAM, all this kind of stuff).

So this day one of the level 1 support guys comes to me and asks me if someone sent a printer to one of the companies agency. As I look up the name of the printer I recalled that I indeed setup and sent a new printer to this agency so I tell him to transfer me the call.

Me: Me - L: Lady that called

Me: It's me from deployment. I was told that you have an issue with the new printer I sent you.

L: Yeah. We installed it on the old one's spot but we can't get it to work. It got power and seems to work but we can't print to it.

Me: Ok, so first can I check with you if everything is plugged in correctly ?

(ensues usual verifications: is the power plugged in, is the internet plugged in, do they have internet in their office, and so on)

L: Yeah everything is plugged in.

Me: Just to make sure, could you plug back the old printer and see if it works ?

L: Ok, no problem.

I wait for a while, they put their old printer back and everything works. As everything seems to be ok in terms of hardware (note that I did test the printer before sending it and everything was working just fine) I start checking with them if I might have made a mistake configuring it to work in their agency.

We spent a good hour and a half checking every possible misconfiguration, reset the printer twice and set it back up and so on.

Me (starting to lose it as I can't find any possible cause): You sure eveything is plugged in right ? All cables are working ?

L (as tired as me): Yeah, we used all the cables that came with this printer.

Me: ... Wait, what cables did you say you used ?

L: Well those that were with the printer.

Me (finally getting it as I recall what was in the box): You mean you used the internet cable that was in the printer's box ?

L: ... Yeah, why ?

Me: ...Because there was no internet cable with the printer.

The printers we used didn't come with ethernet cables (RJ45), however they did come with a telephone one to use it as a fax (RJ11). Turns out they didn't notice that their ""ethernet"" cable didn't quite fit the printer nor the wall's socket. That was one big facepalm moment for the both of us.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ceomyg,A prime example of stubborness,"Our IT department of 4 people caters to about 400 users. Responsibilities are divided in a way that creates little redundancy - put in other words, everyone of us supports about 400 users in his field of expertise.

My field of expertise is the helpdesk. I care for the users, their client hardware and the client software they are using. I also analyze, classify and troubleshoot everything else up to the point where I'm sure it's not a clientside or user problem, so I can hand it off to the responsible colleague.

Part of my responsibilities is to install software that's not available via our automated deployment system for whatever reasons.

As a rule of thumb, if we have an installer on our official app network share, you just give me a heads up and I'll install that for you. If we don't retain an installer for that app yet, I assume that we have not checked if we can use this software - be it for financial or security or other reasons.

$User: ""I really need this quick. I thought you could just install it. We already have it installed on other machines, why are you making this so complicated?""

TBD: ""Sorry, I have to follow protocol, and if we don't retain an installer I have to assume we haven't audited this program yet.""

$User: ""You could just get an installer on the internet!""

TBD: ""Yes. But I can't just download and install any software, even if you show me you have it already installed on some machine. Please write a mail to the ticket system and I will start working on it.""

$User ""So I won't get help quick?""

TBD: ""Write a ticket and I will check, and if I find we can install that software I will install it for you. But I need an official inquiry from you, as a ticket.""

What's more, $User did in fact write an email regarding his software problem. Not to the ticket system, though; but to my boss.

He couldn't be bothered to write a ticket, but he had enough time to write a complaint. Ironically, if he had put the ticket system into CC, we'd have a ticket that I could start working on.

My boss simply informed me that he received the complaint, but he has obviously opted not to make it into a ticket. I wonder why... :)

**The Shortest Call** 

&gt;$Me: *standard call answer spiel * … How can I help you today?


&gt;$Mysterious Stranger who shall forever remain nameless: Oh I don’t want you. *immediately hangs up *


&gt;$Me: O...k. 




**I Expect You to Read My Mind**

So, a user calls in and unfortunately we mostly support hospitals which means Doctors. If you don’t support these nice folks, imagine the stereotypical User we’ve all heard horror stories about and then give that person a sense of authority that has 0 relevance to you but is everything to them. 

This fella calls in, says he talked to $Me yesterday. FALSE. I’d recognize this voice, but whatever, normally we’d just move on. He proceeds to say he called yesterday about “this issue”, and then vaguely mentions how when he closes a window another window opens in this application they use. I ask if he has an incident/ticket number, and no of course not. Ok fine, I can try and look it up other ways but lo and behold! There are no tickets from this guy any time recently with any relation to that issue. Cool. 

He says the application team he got forwarded to asked for examples of the problem, to which he told them the Help Desk has those examples which is impossible because we have no record of this guy calling us or reporting anything about an application problem. Anyway, he wants us to get those examples and immediately states that he has to go help patients, and to let him know as soon as we have those examples given to the application team. Wherein he vaguely mentioned the problem, gave us no time to remote in and check what issue he might be referencing, didn’t give us a device ID to remotely check or anything. 

Sure thing doc, we’ll get right on that issue you’ve now thoroughly pointed out and shown us, well done. Made me wonder how he’d feel if a patient walked up to him said “hey my insides hurt can you get on that?” and then walked off. 

**I’m totally me, now let me see those patient records**

&gt;$Me: *standard spiel that makes me reconsider existence each time *


&gt;$SecurityRisk: Hey, $Me, I need a password reset on *application that has a ton of patient info* 


&gt;$Me: Alright, just need to verify your identity, whats your security PIN?


&gt;$SecurityRisk: I’ve never had to do that before, can’t you just reset it? 


&gt;$Me: No, ma’am, that’s not how this works. I don’t know who did that for you before but we have to verify your identity since this has access to so much patient information ...*blah blah* So if you don’t know your PIN I can write this ticket over to a Security group and you can take it up with them tomorrow at 7 AM. 


&gt;$SecurityRisk: Well this is ridiculous, I need this right now and I’ve never had to do that before.


&gt;$Me: Sorry ma’am, you’ll have to take it up with the Security folks tomorrow.  (At this point I’m happy to say this because this is the concise version and she was becoming irritable and the tone of voice somewhat rude)


A few minutes later, my colleague gets a call. It’s a slow night so I’ve got one ear on his conversation because sometimes I can help him out or vice versa. Plus, he said the magic words. 

&gt;$ObliviousColleague: ...password reset. Sure we can do that, let me just login to *application with ALL the patient info* 

BOOM. What are the chances 2 of those calls back to back? And guess who? That’s right reader that’s made it this far into my ‘short’ stories! $SecurityRisk is back at it. I quietly motion my colleague to mute his phone and see her name on his screen. I inform him of what happened and say if she gets uppity, send her to his ‘manager’. To be clear, I am not a manager. Just a co-worker that doesn’t want this lady to try her BS this late when she’s already been told she’s wrong. 

&gt;$NowInformedColleague/Co-Conspirator: *goes through the PIN verification and tells her the ticket is being sent to Security already * Ma’am? Would you prefer to speak to my manager about this? 


This wonderful shit-eating grin spreads across his face as we both hear that confirmation that we so wished to hear. He passes the headset to me. 


&gt;$Me: Good evening, this is $ NowInformedColleague/Co-Conspirator’s manager $Me. $SecurityRisk, we’ve now both informed you that you can’t reset your password because we can’t verify who you are. The ticket is being sent over to Security to be dealt with tomorrow but it will be noted that you attempted to bypass security protocols regarding patient information. Have a good evening. *hang up*

Very few times is it OK to hang up on a caller, but luckily that one was justified. And it felt so good. Now just to endure a few more months of these types of situations... good luck in the trenches folks.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cep1q0,Backlit Screens and Flashlights are different things,"Prerequisite: First post here, I’m not really tech support but I’m the only one in my family who is fully tech literate. Anyway, onto the story.

So, my mum got one of the new Kindles with a backlit screen but I didn’t know that. However, when I asked if it had a backlit screen, my mum said no it didn’t and that it had a detachable flashlight. This sounded weird to me (and I couldn’t see a flashlight) so I decided to investigate, after it had been set up of course. So, once it was set up, my mum couldn’t figure out how to “setup the flashlight” (which mind you didn’t exist) she passed it to me for help. All I did was go into settings and turn up the backlit screen from off. I explained to mum that it was a backlit screen but she didn’t know what that was so I called in my dad, who can describe things better than me. Once mum knew the difference, she completely denied ever saying it had a flashlight and still does even though she had a friend around who witnessed the whole thing.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_celc29,Ye old Ethanol cable,So the day started out well at the ye old tech-support. Customers are having a great day I love my equipment was actually working. Then the hope of humanity was lost. Where I work we also do over the phone troubleshooting. The lady called about her computer router not being able to receive Internet once the power was ran into it. She said when she bought it there was no “ethanol cord“. In the entire conversation I continue to say ethernet cord. By the end of the entire conversation I myself I accidentally said ethanol cable. Keep in mind it was called an ethanol cable by the customer at least 30 times in this conversation. Just goes to show even IT can screw words up I guess right?,talesfromtechsupport
t3_cekhig,IT and Tech Support can feel extremely rewarding.,"The little lightbulb inside your head at the end of a tough issue, or just a long and strenuous one. 

There is a level system in our IT and I'm tasked with maintaining agents issues along with my own . Every once in a while we have someone that demands to speak to someone higher up. I have been looking to show my ability so I decided to de-escalste him and have the agent transfer him to me and I would work on his issue. 

There had been an update recently that was pushed company wide, and there were a couple notable issues. Some were basically cut and dry, try to do this one thing that may or may not work, if not. Re-image it. As there were no other fixes at the moment. Enter 'I want a manager guy' or $IWAM

$IWAM: Hello, HEllo??

$Me: hello $IWAM, how are you doing today?

$IWAM: Hi, Oh I'm doing just great */s laugh*

$Me: */s laugh* Great, now , correct me if im wrong, you're having issues after BAD UPDATE right? 

$IWAM: Well, I am kind of your perfect storm it seems. Because the helpdesk always has a different fix for my issue and it's never fixed!

$ME: Gotcha, May I remote into your machine? 

I remote into the PC and I open up event viewer and see nothing about his issue. He had been experiencing crashing applications at random, even screenshots would crash. Connecting to our network one way would crash IE and he has to use this method AND IE. Started that day after updates. They were telling him he has to get reimaged. I took this as an opportunity to try to find a solution to the known issue. 

I was transparent about what I was doing, trying my best to put it into terms most people can understand. I had no information for what I was doing. This is technically entry level so we are mostly expected to fix a stray setting or Checkbos. Or to rebuild a profile. 
I saw a random event in event viewer that referenced a dll. Reinstalled the graphics driver cause of the screenshot thing. He didn't have a print driver in device manager, reinstalled that. Ran a system file checker. Had him reboot after each step. I did about another 30 mins of t/s for general usability and cleanup. And had him reboot a final time. Everything started working just like a dream. Finished it up with a convo about dogs and the guy was super happy. 

That is one of the best feelings right now for me. I am transitioning into other things but it is a great experience.

Edit: entire callasted about 3 1/2 hours",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ceb01m,Encyclopædia Moronica: W is for Wins from Zeroes,"It was a bright, sunny morning - birds were singing, the call queue was under control, the preventative maintenance up to date, and the office conversation was pleasant and lighthearted.  
In short, it was a perfect day at work.

TOO perfect. Clearly, something nefarious was afoot.

Caller ID flashed; the boss was calling. Time to lance this festering boil of pleasantness, and reveal the pustulent horrors within.

&gt; BOSS: Hey Gambatte!

&gt; ME: Hey Boss. What's up?

&gt; BOSS: Well, I've got good news, and I've got bad news...

Dammit. I knew it.

&gt; BOSS: The good news is that we're taking on a new customer, MAJOR_STORE!

&gt; ME: Nice! Do we have any information on what models of equipment they're using, service manuals, tech logins and whatnot?

&gt; BOSS: Well, uh, this came to us through SUPPLIER because they're using their equipment; apparently the original service provider for MAJOR_STORE just closed their doors and left all of their customers hanging with no notice.

&gt; ME: Uh oh. I have a sinking feeling...

&gt; BOSS: Yeah. The bad news is that we started as of Friday last week.

&gt; ME: Okay, we can...

&gt; BOSS: ...and you have three outstanding faults at your local store.

&gt; ME: Alright. Yeah, I can deal with that. Can you send through the fault information? I'll review it, and then contact the site managers about how we can best alleviate their issues until we can get a permanent fix in place.

&gt; BOSS: Well...

&gt; ME: No, let me guess. Because this is so new, we don't have a way to get the fault information into our system yet, so we know we have three outstanding faults - probably even case numbers - but no idea what they actually are?

&gt; BOSS: Yeah, pretty much. Have you played this game before?

&gt; ME: More often than I like. Alright, I'll head to site and figure out what's going on; the site manager might be able to pull the information from their system with those case numbers.

&gt; BOSS: Cool; let me know what you find out!

---

Less than half an hour later, I walked through the front doors of the store. I located a manager and introduced myself; we walked through the site induction and signing in process, then we started talking about the outstanding issues.

&gt; MANAGER: Well this printer prints funny. And so does this one.

&gt; ME: Okay, I had three case references for faults - do you know anything about this last one?

&gt; MANAGER: Uh... Oh, here it is! Yeah, we called in the same fault twice on two different days, and got two different case numbers.

Oh, this is going to be a fun site to look after.  
I tracked down model and serial numbers for all the equipment that had faults lodged against them, and departed. For now.

---

I found the manuals for the printers online. The poor printing quality was likely due to faulty print heads, so let's Oprah this - you get a new print head, and you get a new print head, everyone gets new print heads! Even the printers that they hadn't reported issues with, because they were in the minority. The one that was printing ""funny"" also got a replacement main logic board.  
In the space of three parts deliveries over about as many weeks, all of the outstanding faults were cleared.

&gt; ME: Hey Manager, I think we're done here - as best I determine, all of the reported faults are now resolved.

&gt; MANAGER: That's great! Does that include EQUIPMENT?

&gt; ME: ...What's wrong with EQUIPMENT?

&gt; MANAGER: I don't know. The screen's black?

&gt; ME: I don't have a call for it, but I guess I can take a quick look. If it's not a simple fix, you might need to log a call.

&gt; MANAGER: Great, thanks!

&gt; ME: ...I don't know where EQUIPMENT is.

&gt; MANAGER: Oh! Uh... There's seven identical installs scattered around the building, so just have a look around, I guess?

Great, I guess I'll just wander around until I find one that's malfunctioning? Well, we charge by the hour, so if they want me to wander about aimlessly, then the Customer Is Always Right.¹

---

¹ In this one, singular, very exact scenario; specifically, where it is at their expense, and I don't have anything else that I'd rather be doing.

---

After a few minutes, I identified not one, but two sets of EQUIPMENT that were non-functional.

The first was a very difficult problem, that took all of my many years of experience to correct.  
I plugged it back in.

The second was considerably more complex. On powering it up, the BIOS splash screen would flash up... then the screen would go black.

&gt; ME: Uh... Manager? I've got no information on this equipment; is that what it's meant to do?

&gt; MANAGER: ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

&gt; ME: ... Thanks.

After a few minutes of the screen continuing to be black, I gathered that the equipment was not in some sort of start up processing state.

&gt; ME: Okay, I think this has got something a bit more serious wrong with it - you'll have to raise a fault call so I can book some time and parts against it.

&gt; MANAGER: No problem, I'll book it right now!

&gt; ME: Great - I'll be back once I've got the job and the paperwork is in order.

&gt; MANAGER: Ha! I'm doing it right now; you won't even get out of the car park!

---

I made it out of the car park.

---

Two weeks later, a new job dinged into my queue. At long, long last, the job for EQUIPMENT had arrived.  
In the interim, we'd finally received the official process for investigating and troubleshooting EQUIPMENT - there was a special USB cable, a SD card, and a whole official and trademarked process detailing how to reload the files. Now that I had a job, I quickly drove back down to the store, extracted the EQUIPMENT, and brought it back to the workshop, so as to better follow the official processes.

Official process #1: Power up EQUIPMENT, connect the USB cable, and access internal storage to reload application files from external sources. RESULT: No dice. EQUIPMENT is completely unresponsive.  
Official process #2: Boot from SD card, copy application files from SD card to internal storage. RESULT: Nada. Boot menu doesn't even present on the screen.  
Official process #3: ...  
Unofficial process #1: Improvise? Uh, I mean, ""fall back on the skills and wisdom developed over years of experience"", aka poke at it and see what happens.

I consulted the manuals again - and again - and again. On what felt like the nine hundredth consultation of the system manuals, I happened to notice a diagram that demonstrated the position of a RESET switch under an almost unnoticeable pin hole. Given a severe lack of other options presenting themselves, I grabbed a paperclip and tentatively probed the recess.

And... nothing. No haptic or audible feedback; I might as well have been pressing a paperclip into the workbench. Intrigued, I reached for a screwdriver...

In moments, the case was open. Inspecting the switch revealed that pressing it produced the normally expected click. However, under the pin hole was a soft plastic cover - which had a small hole through it. The broken edges of the hole looked as if they might line up with the switch... Some short work with a sharp knife and some plastic cement² soon had it repaired well enough to no longer trigger the switch.  
A further few moments reassembling the case, and I was able to power up the EQUIPMENT - and this time, the BIOS splash screen lasted much longer than 10 seconds. After a few more moments, the store application loaded, and the EQUIPMENT appeared to be fully functional once again.

I grabbed the paperclip once again and applied it to the RESET switch. After holding it down for 10 seconds, the screen abruptly switched off.  
I watched, and waited, and watched some more.

After a moment of watching the system not boot up again, I was struck by a thought. I applied the paperclip once again - and the system immediately began booting.

The RESET switch was actually a POWER switch, and after being turned off, it needed to be turned back on again.  
The damaged cover had been holding down the POWER switch, so when it was powered up, it would get 10 seconds into the boot sequence - just enough to display the BIOS splash screen - then turn off.

---

² That these tools of my hobbies were readily available in the workshop should imply nothing about my utilization of work hours, because as demonstrated, there were *legitimate business reasons* for these tools to be present. /shiftyeyes

---
---

**TL/DR: Zero information about a new customer, zero preparation time, zero useful official processes received from on high. Still resolved all reported faults (and few that weren't) in the first few weeks.**

**Addendum:**

&gt; BOSS: Hey Gambatte, how has MAJOR_STORE been?

&gt; ME: Eh... Apart from their penchant for reporting a single fault multiple times, they haven't been too bad. Some of the managers can be a bit grumpy sometimes, but that's no different from any other customer. Why do you ask?

&gt; BOSS: Oh, okay. I was talking with some of the guys from SUPPLIER; apparently when they talk about MAJOR_STORE, the branch that always comes up as the example of the worst customer behaviour is the one closest to you.

&gt; ME: Well... Good to know, I guess? They've been perfectly reasonable, so far. I guess... I'll keep an eye on them, and let you know if they take a turn for the worse.

t3_celkfu,Network changes,"So today is the day my uni decided to launch its new authentication server for the network. 

I have given my bosses at a minimum, a month heads up of what’s coming in this change and how to handle it.  

Well, Fast forward to today and NOTHING is connected to the network. As I sit in my summer class taking the first test of the term. My phone starts blowing up with everyone trying to understand why all networking stopped working. I quickly finish my exam so I explain all changes as thoroughly as possible.  

In essence, the change make it so you can only authenticate if you can access a captive portal (usually a networking agreement page) and if your device can’t use a captive portal, you can whitelist all your devices MAC address to bypass it. 

Now that I’ve explained how the new system works. The companies IT admin messages me asking what’s going on. I painstakingly explain the same system over the phone (a lot harder than it sounds especially to someone whose first language isn’t the same as yours)

Currently the system is running via the bypass method and against bosses wishes.  Just goes to show once again. Every university network is still god awful.

I'm the IT guy for a middle sized company. I do everything from managing the servers to responding basic ""How does this work"" questions. All internal stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

One day a colleague from accounting ($CA) forwards me an e-mail, forwarded to her by another colleague from controlling ($CC), asking $CA if the matter was taken care of. In short, the original e-mail was from our ISP, stating the requested changes were made as requested.

$CA forwards the message to $Me, asking if I know what this is about.

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: It's about the changes to our accounts that were neccessary.

$CA: Yes. But is it done?

$Me: ... Please don't take this the wrong way, but I really don't know what else to tell you other than what is in the original e-mail, literally stating that the changes were made.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of minutes later, I hear $CC and $CA talking around the corner of my office (I usually keep my door closed because I usually listen to music. Today I forgot my bluetooth speaker, so the door stayed open). Basically that my answer was typically IT and some other stuff I didn't quite made out.

t3_cef343,"I received mine, please call me with instructions when you are ready.","This is a short one, but it seriously damaged what little faith I had left in humanity.

I work for a company where most of the revenue generators work from home. We are affiliated with the Travel Industry. I am the System Administrator, but I do most of the Tech Support, in addition to System Admin duties.

We have had a string of equipment failures due to improperly protected computer equipment over the last few weeks. Most of these were able to traced back to power strips that had inadequate surge protection when they were brand new, and some of these powerstrips were over a decade old.

I was able to convince the company that a $15 to $20 surge protector was worth the investment to protect about $2,000 worth of equipment. I selected a surge protector on amazon and went through the tedious chore of sending 1 to each person's home. This morning, not even an hour ago, my boss got an email from a user, the subject line of this posting, was the only content of the email.

I received mine, please call me with instructions when you are ready.

A surge protector. So my boss forwards me this email and asks me to email all users who got a surge protector instructions on how to install.

I have this one co-worker, we will call her Liz for the sake of this story, who is laughably computer illiterate and has next to no critical thinking skills. 

One night at work she comes to me and says the computer won't let her login. She brings me to said computer in our back room and scans her badge to login and it prompts her to input her password. (keep in mind, Liz had worked here for several weeks at the time of this story and I had had to help her call our help desk on NUMEROUS occasions to reset her password)

Liz: What am I supposed to type in here?

Me: (facepalming internally) Your password?

Liz: but it's not working! What password am I supposed to use???

Me: The same password you use to login to your email, the schedule, our HR software, and our medical record program. (very secure I know. This isn't by our choice, it literally sets the password for everything to be the same when we have to reset it every 90 days and there's no way to have individual passwords for every program, I've tried)

Liz: I tried that but it's still not letting me in!

She proceeds to hunt and peck type in an all lower case password (our system has a requirement that there be at least one upper case and one number)

Me: (About to headdesk more than just internally) there should be at least one upper case letter in your password. Are you SURE you're typing it in EXACTLY as you set it?

Liz: That matters??

Me: yes.... Passwords are case sensitive for a reason. If you capitalized a letter when you set your password you need to capitalize it every time you login. 

This was not the last time I had to help her with basic stuff like this either. If there's any interest, I can post more stories to do with her as well as some of my other escapades helping people with basic computer stuff here at work.

t3_cdx5v5,A US bank is losing millions per day.. I think it's our fault,"Around 2015 I was working as a Senior Developer (and occasional 3rd line support) at $company, a London-based software house that provides financial software to most of the world's big investment banks. One day I get an instant message from a senior client manager, $bob, explaining that something's gone wrong in $bigbank and they're unable to do any business (specifically, ECM and DCM deals - so they're not able to participate in IPOs, follow ons, etc). They're losing millions of dollars per day. They want to know if it's our software at fault. This is easily the biggest issue I've ever had the pleasure of being involved in - I had no idea what I was getting myself in for.

&amp;#x200B;

Following $bob's instructions, I join a conference call.

Immediately, I hear an american voice saying ""Is that $company? Is the developer from $company here?"" and I introduce myself,

$me: ""Hi folks, Timje here, I'm a senior developer from $company-""

$voice1: ""-Excellent. When was the last time a new build of your software hit our system?-""

$voice2: ""-Is there any reason why X pipeline would start refusing connections to Y connector?-""

$voice3: ""-We're seeing an outage that formed around 32 hours ago where we're not seeing anything in $MysteriousSoundingDashboard ...""

$me: ""Ah, yes, good, I'll have to look into these things and get back to you"" \*I mute myself while they continue to throw questions around, often talking over one another\*. Some of the voices are shouting. I can't tell how many people are on the call, but it's more than ten. I'm trying to write down their questions but many of them are above my paygrade - I'm a codemonkey, they're asking for big picture stuff. Much of what they're asking can only be answered by their internal IT team.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I get an instant message from $bob -&gt; ""Sorry about this. Some of these guys have been on this call for 30 hours.""

The penny drops. Jesus fucking christ, those poor bastards. I'm sure they're well paid for it, but these poor fuckers, the super tech support team, have been trying to work out why they aren't getting any deals through their pipeline and have been calling up every software provider the bank uses, asking for insights. They've been fishing for answers for 30 hours. And in the meantime one of the world's biggest investment banks is crippled.

So I ask them what's changed in their side - around four weeks ago they started blocking all SSL3 traffic because of poodle, but they were assured that everything uses TLS by now. Also everything worked fine after the changeover (until now).

&amp;#x200B;

I bring up the code for the crusty little pipeline we built for $bigbank, $shitconnector.  I was the last person in London to touch it, which is why I got roped in to this call. It was built around a decade ago, and uses c# code compiled into .dlls that are then somehow stored in a SQL database and run as stored procedures - it's a shitshow. The project only opens in visual studio 2005.It takes data from our current system (a ten year old piece of software that organises and manages DCM, ECM deals and mergers / aquisitions) and converts it into data from our last system (retired in the early 2000s) and then maps that and pipes that over to our main competitor's system. It's a secret piece of software that isn't supposed to exist, it's not been properly supported for years, and its existence is secret because our system is Absolutely Not Compatible with our competitor's. Its test suite has 150 tests, 100 of which have never been known to work. Noone really knows how to certify that it functions, as we don't even have documentation about the data formats it uses.

&amp;#x200B;

I pull the latest from source control. One of our European offshore friends made a small change around 6 months ago, to the handshake / login protocols, which includes this line of code:

`ShitConnector.Service.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Ssl3;`

Now this is smells suspicious, but after a bit of digging I learn that this 'upgrade' was deployed to their servers five weeks ago, and their system's only just fallen over now. I ask the chaps on the phone if it's been a particularly busy time lately - no, it's been pretty quiet. Their pipeline's fallen over and our software does make up a key part of it, so we might be at fault. But nothing's happened in the last few days that would indicate that the issue lies with us.

So I message $bob -

$me: I think I see a potential issue. This might all be our fault

$bob: What. Really? Jesus christ this is huge. Please tell me it's not our fault.

$me: I can't prove it yet, the timelines don't match up, but it looks like our latest deployment has something in it that only works with SSL3, which they recently disallowed.

$bob: OK. Let me know when you know more.

So I dig into how the handshake works. It looks like if connection isn't available when a message needs to be sent, it'll reconnect, get a new token and store that in the database, and then send the message. After the handshake succeeds, the connection token is stored in the database and used in future communications, so the handshake's only actually used after the connection is dropped by something else.

So the penny drops. It's been quiet over at the bank.

Maybe quiet enough for the server to go to sleep?

So here's how to build a timebomb. Five weeks ago, our nasty code goes into place. Four weeks ago, they block all non-TLS traffic (I.E. SSL2, SSL3). Presumably they have to identify the traffic to block it, via the handshake. A few days ago, their servers go quiet enough to recycle (or maybe it was scheduled, or something else got in the way). And when our program is called again, it starts up, creates a new connection, and forces the protocol to be SSL3. Boom, millions of dollars lost while everyone panics.

&amp;#x200B;

The fix was trivial, literally a one line fix, but we had to make it sound like it was a big patch - if anyone at $bigbank found out that they'd lost millions on a one-liner, they'd have gone berserk. As I understand it, though, the relationship carried on, and that one rusty $shitconnector is still plugging away today, moving all of $bigbank's deals through our software into our competitors through black magic and duct tape.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT -&gt; I can now recall more of the details, so let me go into specifics -&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

 [https://blog.sqlauthority.com/2008/10/19/sql-server-introduction-to-clr-simple-example-of-clr-stored-procedure/](https://blog.sqlauthority.com/2008/10/19/sql-server-introduction-to-clr-simple-example-of-clr-stored-procedure/)

The application was c#, compiled into DLLs and run as stored procedures inside a SQL Server database. It's called a CLR stored procedure. The stored procedures resembled the stored procedures of the old deprecated program (i.e. same name, same parameters... the stored procs were used as the.. interface?..) - so basically our competitors could fire data at what looked like the stored procedures of our old system -&gt; but instead this executes some c# that creates an HTTP client, does some sort of handshake and then starts making API requests to our 'newer' program. So basically it was a pipe for getting data from our competitor's export function into our newer import APIs. I'm sure it was a fuckin mess when it was written, but now?.. It was undocumented, the tests didn't run and noone had a harness to simulate the data that would be coming in. 

  
The timeout means that this poor SQL Server box must have been making outbound calls to our API and keeping the connection open for weeks at a time...",talesfromtechsupport

t3_cdxx4f,"Don't worry about what it says, just sign the contract.","I’ll make this one short because I’m still kinda pissed about being yelled at about something someone else agreed to pay for. 

I work for a company that does a lot of remote network maintenance. I have a new client who recently had their IT guy leave, for what I assume is greener pastures, and they have a server that my Labtech agent detected had not been rebooted in… 1638 days. Yeah, 4 and a half years. I didn’t believe what I was looking at either. It’s Windows Server 2012 with a hypervisor sitting on it. 

So I billed the customer 1 hour of level 1 remote support ($125) and called it a night. Even though that was a solid 6 hours of updates. It’s a fire-and-forget kind of thing and I just watched it reboot a bunch of times while I played Satisfactory on PC. (Check it out, good game).

That was about two weeks ago. So, this morning I get a call from the client, angry as a slapped hornet’s nest, wanting to know why they have an invoice for $125 for a “server reboot”. I explained to the client that I did 4 and a half years of updates overnight and that required several reboots over the course of 6 or 7 hours. I only billed one hour because it’s probably not their fault that it was that way. Your last IT guy was a complete idiot. 

I ended up removing the charge as a one-time courtesy and showing the customer in the contract he signed where we will be rebooting his server every 30 days for regular scheduled maintenance and I will only bill 30 minutes each time ($62.50/month) to keep his server updated. The only reason I billed 1 hour was because holy shit dude your server wasn’t rebooted in 4 ½ years. You want me to just do shit for free?",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cdz1ie,"Old, Neglected Equipment, OR, This Place Is A Disaster!","I'm out at my DR facility for the week with my datacenter admin. He rarely gets to come out here, because it's expensive. This is effectively a lights-out facility. It needs to be 100% remotely managed since we can't just have someone drive up here and fix hardware problems. Yes, we can have the datacenter staff do stuff, but the cost is low and we got what we paid for. I REALLY wouldn't trust them in the cage with anything more simplistic than replacing a failed hard drive. My datacenter admin needed a month to get everything done. Our boss sent me with him to cut that time down. The two of us would need 2 weeks. We got one. Tomorrow is our last day out here.

&amp;#x200B;

The past week has been a flurry of work. Installing some new storage in the array controllers, upgrading our VM hosts, and decomming some unused equipment. Then there's the firmware updates.

&amp;#x200B;

We're an HP shop, and we've got a ton of HP servers at our primary location. Brand new Gen10 Synergy 12000 Bladecenter. Gen8 ProLiants for our DB servers. Good stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

At DR, it's a different story. Gen8 VM hosts with firmware current as of last year when they were upgraded to ESXi 6.5. The Infrastructure and monitoring systems? Those are Gen6 and Gen7 boxes. And they needed to be relocated to a different rack. So I get the Gen7 firmware pack ISO, burn it to a thumb drive (by copying the ISO directly to the raw device), and I try to access the iLO so I can remote console in (it's COLD in the cage), but the iLO doesn't respond. No biggie. Hook a keyboard and monitor to the server and boot from the thumb drive.

&amp;#x200B;

Except the server boots the OS instead. I check the BIOS settings. Boot from USB is at the top of the list. USB is enabled (I know this because this system was used to burn the ISO image to the thumb drive). It just won't boot.

&amp;#x200B;

It's late, so I go back to the hotel and login remotely. I launch the HP Smart Update Manager and point my web browser at it. I tell it to update the firmware, which it does.

&amp;#x200B;

Except the iLO. That fails.

&amp;#x200B;

I ask the all-knowing Intarwebs for help. If your iLO version is below 1.20, you MUST update to 1.28 FIRST. Current is 1.88.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at 1.00.

&amp;#x200B;

It's NEVER been updated.

&amp;#x200B;

Which is probably why the system wouldn't boot from the thumb drive. Apparently there were some BIOS bugs that stopped Boot From USB from working correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

Our DR site is the redheaded-stepchild of the organization. It's neglected and abused. Chained up in the closet.

&amp;#x200B;

I have today to update 6 DB servers, and I've only got buy-in from the DBA team for half of them. If I can get these done, I'll be able to better administrate these things remotely.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cdyq2e,"I'm having this issue where my 3rd party cannot open this app, that we all can!","I work at an MSP, and after half a year I got my first shareable offense. 

User: ""I have a 3rd party accountant who cannot connect to this app that we use every month""

t3_cdotva,"The boss isn't always right, but he is always the boss.","But not all bosses are weak, cowardly weasels. Some will eat crow when it's on the menu.

Hapless Hank works for a retail chain with a couple of dozen stores in three states. He's been there since the era of dumb terminals and analog data lines, and he built today's VPN based WAN for the Windows point of sale system from the ground up. He's been with the company for a long, long time, and it has worked out well for the company and for Hank.

One of the reasons it has worked out well is that he has trained his boss well. The boss, who we shall call Bob, because that's not his name, is the #2 guy in the company, and is rather more tech savvy than most execs. But he knows his limits. He also knows that if he asks Hapless Hank technical questions, trying to sound smart for the owner, he'll get technical answers until his eyes glaze over and he asks for an executive summary.

The bottom line is, if Hank is out of the office for the rare vacation, Bob the Boss can handle most of the routine stuff that comes up. And when something needs to be done, Bob the Boss and the owner tell Hank what they want, Hank tells them what it will cost, and they say yeah or nay, and everybody gets on with their job.

Hank has been with the company for a long time because he likes working there, and they keep him around because he does the job well.

A virtual paradise of IT work.

But even the Garden of Eden has its snake. And occasionally, that snake will bite someone. In this case, it actually bit someone who had it coming.

The main point-of-sale server had been spontaneously shutting down for no apparent reason, and going through some acrobatics on reboot. It didn't take long for everyone, including the support desk at the vendor, to agree that it sounded like the UPS was going bad. (The electrical service in the neighborhood was . . . less than perfectly reliable, and occasional blips were not uncommon.) But nobody was certain enough to foot the bill to replace it without a test. So a test was in order.

The server was, of course, running on a state of the art *nix operating system. The sort that really doesn't like not being shut down properly (hence the acrobatics on reboot). Bad things can happen, like corrupted file systems. Hapless Hank knew this, and explained it carefully to Bob the Boss using small words. But this was early in their relationship, and Bob hadn't yet learned that when Hank was certain about something, he was almost always right. And Bob was feeling a little cocky.

&gt;Bob: Let's just unplug the UPS from the wall and see what happens.

&gt;Hank: That's a bad idea. It could corrupt the file system. The server wouldn't boot, and somebody would have to spend the next four and a half hours doing a restore from the backup tape. Then the stores would have to go through the logs and manually reenter all the business that happened before it died. And we'd have to enter all the credit card stuff as cash, so the books would be a mess. You know our controller won't like that at all.

(Yeah, it really took that long. There was a lot of data, and the drive was chosen more for reliability than speed. And it was a long time ago.)

&gt;Bob: Oh, it'll be fine.

&gt;Hank: I really advise against it. We need to shut the server down first (which involves notifying all the stores to go offline, because neither of our adventurers wanted to come in after hours).

&gt;Bob: That'll take a half an hour by the time we call everyone, shut it down, and boot it back up. And the stores hate going offline. And it's dinner time. It'll be fine.

&gt;Hank: If it doesn't boot back up, I'm not staying to do the restore. 

&gt;Bob: Fine. If it doesn't boot back up, I'll stay and do the restore.

You already know the rest of the story. I went out to dinner at a nice steak house. Bob, IIRC, had stale donuts, watching the percentage restored sloooowly count up for four and a half hours, while all the stores were offline. Accounting was unhappy the next morning because nobody could balance the books and do the bank deposit until they'd manually rekeyed everything and uploaded all the offline transactions. Bob the Boss didn't have an especially happy day, because crow is not tasty, even with salt.

These days, Bob the Boss does not *always* listen to Hapless Hank. But when it's a warning of possible technical problems, it's the way to bet.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cdw134,Passwordless Problems,"A long time ago, I was interviewing for a job I start in two weeks. I'd gotten the interview because my side hustle was on the retail side of this company. The specifics of the job aren't important, but part of it was/will be creating an application for the IT help desk. Part of their interview barrage was talking to two people who managed the help desk to see how we got on.

As I we started the interview, we did the same thing as the previous four times.  Who are we all?  I'm $ME, here to find your pain points and use $PLATFORM to build apps to alleviate those, if you all like me.  She's $HARDWARE, czar of devices.  Since we're retail, there are many many computers, scanners, tablets, label printer, etc... across the country.  He is $HELPDESK, helpdesk monarch, and he despairs of all the ways people report issues. He really wishes people would just submit tickets, which is the first I heard of any process to submit tickets, tbqh.

Here we stop and get ready to move on. Unfortunately $HELPDESK has reminded me of something.  I noticed an issue with registers a couple months ago, so let's get this interview off the rails.

&gt; $ME: So, I'm sorry to do this, but you reminded me of POS issue.  There's passwordless Powershell acess as an administrator

&gt; $HELPDESK, Confused: Well, yes, that would be an important issue!

&gt; $HARDWARE: &lt;stares confusedly&gt;

&gt; $ME: Uhh, you guys know I'm a $RETAIL_EMPLOYEE_NICKNAME, right?

&gt; $HELPDESK: No, we didn't. Wait. Are you saying that's something we have?

&gt; $ME: Yeah. Across our entire store.  Maybe others?

&gt; $HELPDESK: Well, this is definitely the weirdest way I've gotten a ticket filed.  That seems important.

&gt; $HARDWARE: &lt;still looks bemused&gt;

And we move on with the interview.  It went well beyond that.

-----

A couple weeks later (two weeks ago), I get my offer and resign from my main gig.  At lunch I drive over to the retail store and give them the news.

They're happy for me but sad I'm leaving.  I am too, they're great people.  As I'm walking out, I hear my manager talking to one of my co-workers, mentioning that helpdesk is sending someone out to do register maintenance. They haven't done that since these were installed a year and a half ago.

Guess it was repeatable. My manager cracked up when I told him that was my fault. I blame him for all this.  He asked me to reset the network connection a couple months ago, and that's when I found the bug.

And yesterday, I was hanging out with a friend in management at another store. Everybody is getting patches for their registers.  Oops!

Edit: One person said they were confused, so in a sentence or two: An interviewer complained about all the unofficial ways he gets tickets.  I proceeded to give him a high priority ticket involving tech support on-sites to 100+ stores across America.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cdcarg,When your nerdy hobby actually saves the day,"This morning, I'm on a call with someone in another country, and my manager comes in brandishing a 3.5"" floppy disk.

I thought he was about to make fun of my retrocomputing hobby, as he does sometimes, so I ignored him at first - but then he said ""whoever it is, put them on hold"". This usually means a major issue, so I complied.

""All robots in the factory are down,"" says $boss. ""Critical files needed to restore production are on this floppy disk. We are not aware of any backup medium.""

I unmute the caller and tell him I'll call him back a bit later.

I take the disk and look it over. ""Last updated: 8/3/97,"" I muse. ""Just do what you can, and quickly!"" urges $boss.

Floppy drives were phased out in the business 7+ years ago, but there are two legacy servers still equipped with floppy drives.

I skip down to the server room and try the disk in the first server. Open up Windows explorer... drive is not appearing.

OK, let's not waste any time troubleshooting - we'll try the other one. It won't read the disk.

There are no USB floppy drives anywhere on campus (or if there are, they have excellent hiding spots).

As it happens, last Friday I had a retrocomputing meet to which I had taken my Win95 gaming rig (for a bit of multiplayer LAN goodness). And as it happens, it was still set up in my garage, so I screamed home, used the rig's drive to copy the contents of the floppy to the HDD, then zipped up the directory, FTPed the zip to my NAS and then emailed it via OWA on my home laptop directly to the guys responsible for getting it back up and running.

Order is restored!

I don't think I'll be catching crap about my hobby for a little while.

**TL;DR:** Floppy contains critical files. Nobody has a PC with a floppy drive, except for the retrocomputing geek. Production resumes.

t3_cdfl4g,Why can't I ctrl+alt+delete?,"This is a short one.

  
I've been called up by my coworker. I walk to her workstation and ask her what's wrong.

me: ""You just press ctrl + alt + delete and choose 'change your password'.""  
coworker: ""No, it doesn't work, look""

t3_cd7rtc,That's Not How Credit Cards Work Lady,"Backstory:

My dad spent a summer during college working at \[insert credit card company here\]. He worked a customer service phone line with a bunch of other teens working this same summer job. They used to get in trouble when customers would complain and ask to elevate the call to a supervisor, so they developed a system where they pretended to be each others supervisors. It worked very well. Now to the story:

Cast: CC: clueless customer MD: my dad PS: pretend supervisor

MD : Thank you for calling \[insert credit card company here\] This is MD, how can I help you

CC : Hi I used your credit card last month, and today you sent me a bill

MD : That can sometimes happen. In fact I'd be surprised if it didn't. What is your question

cc : This bill says I need to pay for these charges

MD : Oh, Are you saying you didn't make these purchases

CC : No, I bought them. I just didn't think I'd have to pay for them

MD : Why would you think that : /

CC : Because this is a rewards card, And I thought I could just go out and collect my rewards

MD : Oh, I'm very sorry. The way this card works is that, like any other credit card you have to pay for what you purchase. What makes our card special is that you earn \[rewards\] on top of what you purchase

CC : That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard! I DEMAND to speak to your supervisor

MD : (smiling and nudging his friend next to him) Just a second ma'm. I'll connect you

...

PS : Hello ma'm, MD has explained the issue you're having.

CC : Yes, and I don't understand how this could be happening!

PS :  Oh, I'm very sorry. The way this card works is that, like any other credit card you have to pay for what you purchase. What makes our card special is that you earn \[rewards\] on top of what you purchase

CC : Oh, I see. And thank you for clarifying. That makes so much more sense. I'm glad somebody there knows what they're doing.

PS: Have a nice day and thank you for calling.

t3_ccfu4m,"New VP ""improves"" the process and almost gets me fired.","Another story reminded me about this one.

I was at a place where things were falling apart.  Stale cases built up in our buckets because we kept on reducing the support staff to save budget.  If a customer stopped responding, we didn't chase them down.  We rarely had time to scrape through our queue to follow-up on old cases.

We got a new VP of Customer Success.  She contracted out a support team in India and got rid of our team in Southern California.  She replaced 3 very experienced people with a team of 12.  Sounds good, but this team of 12 was new, and they were put on the phones immediately.

She then handed down a new rule that we (US team) could absolutely do no overtime except for a max of 2 hours a week for on-call escalation consult (we didn't work directly with the customer for these, only the India team).  When our shift was over, we were to warm transfer any active cases to the overseas (oursourced) team.  No Exceptions.  My direct manager tried to push back against this new rule but he was told to pound sand.

I was on a call with a customer who also happened to be an investor and they had a seat on our board.  I usually hand-held them through things, and I did a lot of after-hours stuff with them.  They pretty much just worked with me most of the time.  It got close to 5PM and I told them that ""due to new policies, I will have to hand this call off to the next shift.""  I got a little pushback, however the other guy understood office politics well enough to know that I had to hand him off.  He asked to speak to my manager.  My manager agreed to take the call and I handed it off to him.  I then clocked out and went home.

Well, the overseas team couldn't help the customer.  He asked that the case be escalated and they did so.  It ended up back in my queue, but I was not allowed to even check in with the case.  The guy emailed me directly and I explained that we have new rules and I can't go around them.  I also told him that since was not scheduled to be on-call this weekend, I'm not allowed to work on the case.  The guy that was already on-call had maxed out his 2 on-call hours for the weekend on Friday night.  The case sat until Monday.

On Monday, I jumped back on and got them fixed in about 30 minutes.  The guy warned me that his boss raised a big stink with us, but they explained the situation and that it wasn't my fault since I was following orders - I should be all-good.  Come Monday afternoon (because everybody else comes in later then tech support), I got hauled upstairs with my direct manager, HR and the CEO.  A folder with my name was sitting on the desk of HR.  I'm pretty sure it was my termination letter (because fuck me, right?).

They asked me to explain what happened, and why did I suddenly ""refuse"" to help our customer/investor and board member.  I explained what happened, and that I followed the rules to the letter.  My boss jumped in and said ""He followed the rules as set by VP.  I got on the phone and repeated the rules to the customer.  I also told them that our VP set these rules and that there were to be no exceptions, and they accepted the transfer to the new guys.""

My boss then said ""here is an email I got from the customer, as well as a copy of the phone conversation.  I don't know what kind of bullshit you guys heard, but you can see in the email here, they love our guy, and they want us to fix our policy.""  He pulled out another email and said ""here's the policy from VP - as you can see, she is very explicit that there are no exceptions.""

At this point I was excused from the room and sent back to continue my day.  Later on, my boss comes downstairs and calls me into his office.  He shuts the door and said ""listen to this.""  He played back some of the meeting that he recorded on his phone.

I couldn't hear everything, but basically, they got the VP on the speaker phone and tore her apart.  She tried to back-peddle and said ""I already talked to TS-BOSS (my boss) and he of course knows there are always exceptions, JAZZB54 doesn't know what he is doing - I'll take care of it."" My boss spoke up and yelled out ""bullshit!  Read the fucking email she sent me."" (my boss could be an belligerent ass, but he was always fair).

HR read the email exchange the VP had with my boss out-loud, including the part where she emphasized that there were to be no exceptions.  Recording ended at that point.

Later that week, it was announced that my boss was the interm-VP of Worldwide Customer Success.  The previous VP was moved to VP of Operations.  It was the 3rd time she was re-assigned.

Things went back to the way they were.  Backlog still sucked, but we were at least able to help customers that worked with us.  We got back our overtime and started booking 20+ hours of overtime a week.

A short time later, I left for a job that paid much more, and I only had to work 40-45 hours a week.  I still keep in contact with my former boss.  The stories he tells me... I'm surprised they are even still in business.

TLDR: New VP fucked shit up.  I almost got thrown under the bus but my boss saved me.  VP didn't get fired, but I found a new job.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ccj0dq,The day the HDMI died... a little.,"I am the entirety of the tech department at a large music school. I do everything, from computer purchasing and provisioning, to software support, to admin duties on 5-7 different systems, all deep data pulls and reporting, phone systems, printers, websites, kiosks, lighting, plumbing, fixing door knobs and chairs, staple removers and chairs... and AV. 

I set up (and *fully* tested the day before) a MacBook connected via HDMI to a receiver that feeds audio to surround sound speakers and an HDMI projector: literally plug and play except on some older Dell laptops that die if you connect HDMI while the thing is actually running. Yesterday, gorgeous sound through the sound system, took a minute to realize we had to change the video output from 1080p to 1080i to keep the image from bleeding out of the white screen area (I’m looking up the differences as soon as I’m done posting this). 

So, knowing it works, I set it up the exact same way today, knowing I would have about 120 kids and 60-80 parents watching us screen 3 short movies the kids filmed over the past two weeks. I’m cool, everything is 5x5, plugged in the laptop, instantly got video, let’s do this. 

Director introduces the program, it’s the first time doing short films at this camp, the school finally has the tech, this should be awesome. I kill the lights, hit play on the MacBook, the title sequence plays, the film starts... silently.  F*#%!

Reset the HDMI connection (unplug/replug). Computer audio out shows as muted. It can not be changed. Change HDMI inputs on the receiver. I’m starting to sweat, the director goes back up to do a Q&amp;A (best advice as a film maker? Don’t trust technology!) while I continue trouble-shooting. Other inputs work just fine. Go back to the input for the laptop. Silence. Check audio/sound options. I can pick internal audio or the receiver. Internal audio works fine. Picking the receiver mutes the laptop. Power cycle the receiver. Silence. Reboot the laptop. Can’t get it to login. Director announces his password in front of the entire crowd. I laugh, tell him to change it when we’re done, and still can’t login. Take the laptop up to him on stage so HE can type it in. It finally logs in. Try the HDMI again. Silence. It feels like 20 minutes have passed, but was probably just 5-10. Finally have a brain wave...

Sprint to my office to grab an 1/8”-RCA cable, grab a powered speaker out of the closet where the HDMI receiver lives, plug the laptop directly into the speaker, and SOUND GLORIOUS SOUND!! I get the best/worst standing ovation of my life. Kids chanting my name. Seriously, it should have been awesome. Thinking about it, I kind of want to cry instead. Movies get screened, child filmmakers get mad props, everyone ELSE has a great time, I get lots of congratulations for “fixing” it. Makes me feel worse. 

I just want to plug in that same laptop to that same HDMI cable on Monday and have the f^#king thing work. I have literally never had a problem with this AV setup that a simple unplug/replug, reset the HDMI signal approach wouldn’t fix. Now I’m confused and scared there’s something else going on. Which, if there IS, I hope it’s on the f^#king MacBook and NOT my AV system. 

What I realized: I never tested the **audio** today. I saw the video pop up as expected and *assumed* everything else was fine. It was a rookie move, and for having 20 years of experience in audio (as well as the other 47 skills listed at the start of this), it was a DUMB rookie move. Test everything. Twice. For your OWN sanity. Then, if you need to figure out a parallel solution, you’ll have more time and NOT have an auditorium with 170+ people waiting for you... cheers or no, that was a bit too nerve-wracking for me... I like it when my stuff just works and doesn’t draw any attention to itself.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ccddus,Customer cursed out VoIP provider,"As mentioned before, I'm an Enterprise Fiber guy so I only deal in a layer 3 connection with a layer 2 switch (most times) a the demarc. 

About three years ago, guy called in absolutely livid about packet loss across his internet circuit. 

Me: ""No problem, sir. Lemme check out the circuit. What's your circuit ID?"" After he gives me the circuit ID, he says, ""Yeah, my VoIP provider says that your route is causing me to drop packets. So you're costing me money on my calls! I've been dealing with this from you for weeks!""

I pull the circuit and, of course, I'm not seeing any issue. I ran a ping test and traceroute from the core to Google's DNS and a public IP from a well-known source as well as from three public looking glasses.

Me: ""Sir, I'm looking at this circuit and there is no issue. The optics are clean, the route is having no issues and all three looking glasses agree with our results.""

Cust: ""I'm sick of this. I'm bringing on my VoIP provider and y'all are going to fix this issue now!""

He puts me on hold and brings on a rep for his VoIP.

Rep: ""Well, sir, we are seeing drops to you VoIP device on site so this is an ISP issue.""

Me: ""Sir, the circuit hasn't dropped once and I assume your VoIP provider is checking remotely. Do you have a connection that isn't using either one of us?""

Cust: ""Yeah.""

Me: ""Ok. Can you run a continuous ping to your gateway's IP and your VoIP provider's IP at the same time? If you want, you can run a ping to Google's DNS and your VoIP provider's IP in the circuit, too.""

The guy starts his test and the rep says something snide but not loud enough to be clearly heard.

Cust: ""Ok both are running. Hold on...what the hell is this?! Hey, (VoIP rep)? Why the hell am I showing packet loss to your IP but not to my gateway?!""

Rep: ""That's because you're using a coax modem to ping and coax connections aren't guaranteed to-""

Cust: ""But I'm not losing a single packet to my ISP gateway and I'm not even on their network!""

Rep: ""Again, that's because you're on a coax connection and-""

Cust: ""Really?! Fine, let's run this on the fiber.""

He sets it up and says...

Cust: ""Oh yeah there's a big difference now. The pings to Google's DNS are much better and you're still dropping packets!""

Rep: ""Well, sir, it could be an issue with the routing-""

Cust: ""That shit doesn't make any sense!! I'm even using a looking glass and packets are dropping to your IP!! You all told me that my performance is great to the internet! I haven't dropped a single damn packet to the internet but your shitty service is constantly dropping! You all told me that it was my provider for weeks and it's been your shit!! I've wasted money on this! How do you explain this?!""

The rep comes up with some answer but I can't hear it because I'm on mute laughing so hard that my leads pull the call to hear it. The rep gets off the phone and the guy says, ""I'm sorry for calling y'all. But can you believe this shit?! They're blaming y'all and costing me money and she tries to blow smoke up my ass while I'm running the test proving her stuff sucks!!""

I don't remember what I said or what happened afterwards other than me laughing for another 10 minutes.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cccdg6,when tech support meets tech support,"i work for a company which gives ipads to to remote users for logging information. we use a third party program to log this information. one of my responsibilities is to mediate the issues between our company's tech support issues and the ones caused by the third party program. in this story i will refer to myself as $Me, the third party support rep as $Rep, and his manager as $Manager.

this morning, i get a complaint from an employee that they are unable to save notes in a certain section. they seem to be doing everything right, so i open a ticket with the third party help desk and tell them about the issue, accompanied with a screenshot of exactly what i'm referring to. 

i get a pretty quick response. they call me directly instead of replying to the support ticket. we go through all the basic troubleshooting that i always make sure to do before hand. ipad is up to date, the software is up to date, and the ipad has been restarted. because of a language barrier i spent several minutes trying to explain to him that my client was not trying to delete a certain section of the notes, but rather they were unable to fill out notes in a certain section. i finally get $Rep to understand my issues and then the following conversation occurs. 

$Rep: everything is working fine from my end. i can save notes without any issues.

$Me: thats great, but my employee cannot do this. 

$Rep: (proceeds to explain step by step instructions on how to add notes)

$Me: the employee is aware of how to save notes, the issue is that after they try to save them, the notes disappear and do not populate in the final report. 

$Rep: im adding notes right now and it's working fine. 

$Me: again, thats great that you can, but why is my employee unable to do so?

$Rep: im not sure, my computer works just fine. could you have her go over this step by step on her computer while we are on the line?

$Me: your computer? our employees only use ipads (the company should be well aware of this. we are their biggest client and we submit support tickets quite often) besides, our employees work remotely and i communicate with them via email.

$Rep: let me forward this up to my manager

*on hold for several minutes*

$Manager: i hear your having issues with notes

$Me: yes, the notes will not populate in a certain section of the report. the employee can add notes to the report, but they disappear when the report is compiled.

$Manager: strange, i can populate notes in that section just fine.

$Me: thats great, $rep said he was able to do so as well, but this does not help my employee. why do you think they are having this issue?

$Manager: im not sure, could we have the employee sit at a computer and do this step by step over the phone?

$Me: No, our employees work remotely and they only use ipads. we cannot sit down with them, and we cannot use a computer. i already told $rep this. 

$Manager: i see, let me check with out ipad development team. (*puts me on hold for about a minute*) This is a known issue and we are working to resolve it.

t3_cchoju,Ordered to learn SEO,"So I worked for this 3rd part MSP for a couple of months &amp; lord knows I can make a ton of posts about my time there (&amp; I probably will over time), but wanted to make my first post in this group not TOO long.

&amp;#x200B;

So as the MSP, my boss/owner ($CEO) decided that we need to be our client's go to people for anything with technology, including security camera installation and website design. He was smart enough to sub-contract that stuff out to people who specialize in that so we can focus on the computer/network aspect. Well one day, he decides that the next big thing we need to get the corner on it website marketing &amp; search engine optimization (SEO). This seems like a smart move, considering that we have company next door to us that we could sub-contract that out and have them refer their clients to us for their MSP work.

&amp;#x200B;

The only problem with this, $CEO doesn't feel that he could get what he would charge clients (after a mark-up for profit on our side) to make it work, so he decided that instead of paying a company whatever it was, he could just charge the client that, then have his technicians (all 2 of us) do it to keep us busy. We both objected, but he pushed back with ""well how hard can it be""? I responded, have you ever looked into it yourself? It's one thing to know the concept of SEO, but another to know how to make it work.

&amp;#x200B;

He kept bringing it up for about 2 weeks because he felt that anything you could do/view on a computer, then his technicians should be able to do without issue. Finally we both had enough &amp; said, well if you think it's so easy, why don't you look into it first &amp; get back to us once you're an SEO master that you think we should be. Never heard of it again.",talesfromtechsupport

(previously on- I'm starting a low budget ISP with a disreputable businessman. I've just racked two servers in a student apartment with a T1 line. I'm running on a few hours' sleep, badly configured DNS and I'm on questionable drugs. Hit it)  
  
I make my way back from Will's colo/apartment without serious incident. Markus is nowhere to be found. I realize that I have a few things to do before I'm unfit for human company. I tutor freshmen and sophomores in intro Economics and I have two or three sessions scheduled for today.  
  
A few answering machine messages and I'm mostly good. I'm not having visual hallucinations yet, but I keep thinking the voices of people in the hallway or out on the street are talking to me.  
  
I ignore them for now. I've decided to avoid human contact and enjoy the ride. I grab my provisions and entertainment for the day:  
  
* A box of Golden Grahams cereal  
  
* A quart of convenience store iced tea  
  
* A VHS copy of Ralph Bakshi's Wizards  
  
I start to settle in my little room and let Avatar and Black Wolf's antics wash over me when I realize that I hadn't actually finished debugging DNS.  
  
I start my Mac, connect to the Internet and manage to log in to my two servers. I think I see what I did wrong in my BIND config files. A little tweaking, a restart of the server and I think I'm good.  
  
I keep getting distracted by the movie, so I eject the VHS tape and put another in at random.  
  
I run through the domains we bought. They're all bringing up the little animated 'under construction' animated gif. 
  
For a few minutes, I stare at the little stick figure guy digging. I wonder if he'll ever finish his task or take a break.   
  
I feel a little sad. I know he's just a gif, but I tap on the glass to check anyway.  
  
My phone rings. I stare at the flashing thing for a minute, hoping it will stop. The coherent part of me regrets buying the Unisonic 6900 clear phone with flashy lights, but it was only a few extra dollars.  
  
It stops ringing. 
  
It starts ringing again. The only way I can make it stop flashing is if I pick it up.  
  
I do.   
  
There's a voice on the other end of the phone. You know how George Orwell said ""by 50, everyone has the face they deserve"". This person has the voice they deserve. She's earned it by dividing the world into two categories- the people that shit on her and the people she shits on.  
  
me:""Hello?""   
  
Karen:""Is this LawTechie? Ivan told us that you'd make our site a priority""  
  
me (regretting that I picked up the phone):""Ok. Let me check my email to see what's going on""  
  
Karen:""We're a very important customer and we expect your full attention""  
  
I turn my monitor back on and start a browser. I don't want to engage Karen^2 in conversation while I wait for our Rube Goldberg linux box acting as a router and dialup controller to start shoving packets at me. I look at the TV screen and notice that I have bad taste in movies. I turn up the volume so I can hear the TV. 
  
Karen:""Did you hear me?""  
  
me:""Uh, hold on a second. I'm checking something""  
  
TV:""You are my agent. I am your case officer. I, in turn, report to your controller""  
  
Eudora (the best POP mail client ever written) finally opens my email. Ivan's been busy. He's managed to sell a website to our local tourist board for $100/month. I've got to set up email for a few of their employees and he's going to start on a website.  
  
Karen:""What's the hold up?""  
  
TV:""Say, Bill, do you think you could rub some of this bug powder on my lips?""  
  
me:""Ok. Ivan's working on the site. I'm going to set up your email addresses and set the passwords to, uhhh, bugpowder95. You should change them the first time you log in""  
  
Karen (sounding more annoyed than previously):""How am I expected to do that?""  
  
I stop and look at Peter Weller's stony face for a second and turn off the TV. I need to concentrate.  
  
Karen:""Well?""  
  
I Timbuktu into the mail server and start setting up Karen's domain and users. 
  
me:""It's going to take me a few minutes to get everything set up. I've set up your users. Next I'm going to set up your webserver.""  
  
Karen:""You said something about changing my password. Where do I put that?""  
  
me:""Hold on a second, one thing at a time""  
  
I start hearing a rustling on the phone. It takes me a second to realize that Karen is pawing through a bag of potato chips and eating them at me.  
  
Normally this would only be annoying, but combining my lack of sleep, Karen's existence and the chemicals in my brain, it's a maelstrom of awfulness. She's going to start gnawing on the phone and somehow yank me over the lines into her gaping maw like some joke creature in Dragon Magazine.  
  
Karen:""Chloorp. Karggh. Crunch. ""  
  
I look for something to make this stop. For a reason you can guess, I decide the best thing to do is to eat back at her to balance out things. I shove a handful of Golden Grahams in my mouth and start chewing. I can't hear her chewing any more.
  
DNS is set up and a stop/restart of the BIND server looks like we're working.  
  
For some dumb reason, I'm finding it hard to correctly type their domain, since there's a significant lag between my keyboard and the remote control software.   
  
Karen's getting impatient, but she's put the chips down for the moment. 
  
Karen:""What are you doing? How do I check my email?""  
  
We have a dull conversation about finding an appropriate POP client (Outlook Express) and where to put in dull information such as incoming and outgoing email servers on the four different PCs in their office. She picks up some other foodstuff that sounds more chewy/slurpy than crunchy for the username/password part of this drill.  
  
Three of the four systems go relatively easy and I only have to eat a few mouthfuls of Golden Grahams at her.  
  
The fourth takes longer. It's the furthest fromm Karen's desk, so she pulls the phone cradle as far as it can go, puts the handset on some hard surface and walks away from it to the fourth PC. This requires me to yell the user name and password several times at her.   
  
Karen:""What?""  
  
me:""BUGPOWDER 95!!!""  
  
Karen:""Where does that go""  
  
me:""In the box that says Password!""    
  
Karen:""What goes there?""  
  
me:""BUGPOWDER 95!!!""  
  
During all this, her phone is rocking on the table or desk it's sitting on, making an insectile clicking sound that I can hear. I'm imagining it turning into some giant precambrian lobster, waving its awful artificial limb colored claws at me. I look in my translucent phone to make sure it's not crawling through the lines and getting caught in the headset, like in Wrath of Khan.  
  
Karen either makes it work or gives up. I slowly disconnect the phone line from my phone and slide it out of my room.  
  
Markus is in the hallway and sees me, covered in Golden Grahams, flustered and sweaty.  
  
Markus:""What was all that racket?""  
  
me:""Tech Support""  
  
I decide to watch regular daytime TV in the living room with Markus. For the only time in my life, I find Delta Burke in Designing Women hilariously funny.   
  
Amazingly enough, we kept the tourist board, bringing on several hundred accounts over the next few months. Ivan paid me sporadically when I threatened him, but never complained when I ran my friend's web stores, band websites and PHPbb forums off of our servers.   
  
I remember getting the ""Tell us how you dealt with a difficult technical problem and how you solved it"" question at a job interview. I considered telling the Karen story but thought better of it and made up a more conventional story.",talesfromtechsupport

T: Do you want to remove the transaction for this client or to remove the client record?

C: Yes, that.

T: Which one, the question presented two different scenarios. 

C: Client record. 

*I explained, in detail, that once removed there is no way to bring it back, including any transactions and information associated with the record.*

C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
*This often was a response that meant “I didn’t understand anything you just said but do what I told you to because I am paying you for it”*

I removed the record as requested

T: is there anything else I can help you with?

t3_cbyeyx,"How a favor for a friend ended up costing a small company millions in sales, and my service fees.","Over the July 4th holiday we had some pretty severe storms in my area. I have been on a very long, and much needed, staycation from work... which has absolutely nothing to do with the release of Shadow Bringers. Nothing to do with that at all. 

I was enjoying a nice cup of diet cola watching some epic cutscenes from the expansion when my phone rang. ""Ignore it Thelightningcount1. IF you ignore it, they will go away."" I go back to gaming when the phone rings 9 more times. 

I finally pick up. 

&gt; $Me - What?  
&gt; $Friend - Can you come help me out, I can make sure you get paid. My new computer in the new office is not working.  

&gt; $Me = Duncan Vizla  
&gt; $Friend = Ezra Bridger (season 1)  
&gt; $FB = Friend's Boss or Boris Shcherbina

&gt; $Me - 200  
&gt; $Friend - Huh?  
&gt; $Me - Im on vacation and that is my fee.  
&gt; $FB - This is his manager. IF you are worth it, I will pay it. 

I drive out to his office and take a look at his PC. It will post, but will not move past that. 

&gt; $ME - May be the hard drive, going to open er up and take a look. 

I open up the case and immediately see the issue. Every cap is blown on the mobo. Every. Single. One. How this thing posted? No fuggin clue. 

&gt; $Me - Uhh... did you guys have any kind of power surge in the building recently?  
&gt; $FB - The building did receive a lightning strike. (No the irony is not lost on me.)  
&gt; $Friend - Nothing had power for most of the week.  
&gt; $ME - Did you not have a surge protector?  
&gt; $FB - See those strips along the floor, those are industrial power strips. I am told that they protect against power surges. 

The things he was pointing out were those long metal office power strips. The ones that have no, or very little, surge protection capability. 

&gt; $Me - Heh those are not surge protectors, merely... power... strips... 

I look at every single computer in the room slowly. 

&gt; $ME - *The exit is just to my left. I can just walk out right now. I can just walk out and never look back... $FB is sort of in my way, but he is scrawnier than me... I can just bowl him over. No one will ever know.* Try turning on all the PCs in this office please. *WHY!!!! WHY DID YOU SAY THAT?*

Of the nearly 200 computers in the office, 1 booted into windows. It was not plugged in at the time of the lightning strike. 

&gt; $FB - What do you suggest?  
&gt; $ME - You got warranty on these machines?  
&gt; $Friend - Wait what?  
&gt; $FB - The simple warranty. I will have to call dell to see if it covers power surges.  

After a short phone call $FB walks out of his office with no color in his face. 

&gt; $FB - The warranty we have does not cover power surges they said they can send out a tech and charge us for every computer that is damage.  
&gt; $ME - Do you have insurance?  
&gt; $FB - Yes.

I collected my 200 and walked out the door thinking it was over. 

Four days later. 

Phone rings and I am currently watching the MOST EPIC cutscene SE have ever done with one of their expansions as I go to fight Emet Selch. 

I ignore it and focus on the game as the most epic of fights followed the most epic of cutscenes. 

The phone rings as I finish up the story line. 

&gt; $FB - How much would you charge to rebuild all of the computers in this office?  
&gt; $Me - How many? *I should just hang up right now.*  
&gt; $FB - All but 1 of them.  
&gt; $Me - 50 bucks per machine. *There is no way he will say yes to that. Looks like you get to focus on titania extreme this weekend.*  
&gt; $FB - 25 per computer?  

I stop... Am I miscalculating how much money 50 per computer was? Answer was yes... yes I was. I dropped an entire zero on that number. That is a lot of money... but I also REALLY want to play this brand new expansion. 

&gt; $Me - 30  
&gt; $FB - Deal.     
&gt; $Me - *Dammit... I think.* OK I will be right over and get to work. 

I drive out there and see a TON of Dell boxes all over the place. 

&gt; $FB - The warranty guy wanted to charge 85 per computer, after the parts. So I just bought the parts and called you. 

I curse myself thinking I shouldn't have low balled it so hard. 

&gt; $ME - Ok. If I am going to do this, you are going to have to help me get everything organized. Each desk will have the parts needed for each PC next to it and I will get to work from there. 

Every PC needed a mobo and PSU replacement as well as half needing ran or processor replacements. Only 1 HDD was damaged and it was a storage drive, not the NVME SSD. 

I go down the line and remove the side panel from each machine, then remove the power cables from each machine, then unscrew the dead mobos from each machine, and you can see how this went. 

By the end of an 8-ish hour day I had most of the work done. Just needed to boot each machine up and pray. 

Wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Only 2 DOA PSUs that came out. Was able to head to Micro Center and grab 2 cheapo PSUs using my own money. The guy said he would reimburse me for it separately. 

By nearly midnight I had all computers up and running and waiting for the logins. There was one thing I forced each new desk to have though. A high quality surge protector. 

I am handed the largest check I have ever seen in my life and walk out the door with a smile. 

I really should not have bought that used Serbu BFG 50-A.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cc3ndw,What kind of toner do scanners use?,"A ticket came in today saying there were lines on scanned copies. The device is a scanner only. My coworker, who has been there in the IT department longer than I have, who has no degree in IT, and only has this position because she's been with the company almost as long as I've been alive, asked - ""What kind of toner do scanners use?"" I didn't even know what to say.  


She also couldn't figure out why a monitor wouldn't work. It was working just fine. It had a black wallpaper but she refused to move the mouse over to that monitor, so she said it just wasn't working. I moved the mouse over to the other monitor and the cursor appeared.

t3_cbwhzp,Know when to ignore the policy.,"First of all I'm not in support, but rather in software development so I usually don't deal with issues like that. Another thing is that our it has a list of email clients they support, but you are allowed to use anything you want, but then you are on your own if it breaks. Everything on the supported list sucks though.

Now this happened a few years ago. While I was slowly packing up my things to go home an executive I've never spoken to for more than a few minutes comes up to me and says that he has a problem with email syncing and the support won't help. I ask about it and feel bad for the guy, literally all he does all day is answer emails and IT is trying to force him to use a shit email client. He also lists what he's tried to do to fix the problem himself and it all seems extremely reasonable. He clearly is not computer illiterate. So I do some googling, stay in 30 minutes after my time ends and fix it.

Next day I had a 6 pack on my desk when I came in with a thank you note on it. A few weeks later I got an email from HR saying that due to executive decision I've received a raise for going above and beyond and to sign the updated contract.

This is why I think you should ignore policy when an important enough person asks to.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cc14j9,There's always a bigger boss,"When I started working for a local council IT support desk in 2005, we had Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for everything.  This was down to the Investors In People certification, but it made life easier for the rest of us.  Where it came to the service desk, we had to take the customer details and attempt to fix their issue.  This may have been anything from pointing them at our website to a maximum of a 1 hour fix. In 2009, I became the second in command of the service desk - mainly because I was the longest served technician and I was also the one who took on the more difficult customers.  In 2011, our manager quit and they intervieweded several people, settling for a guy we'll call Bob.

Bob spends a week learning the procedures and policies, then proceded to call a meeting with the entire team.  Also present was the head of IT, and Bob's immediate boss.  He told us that as there's 100 jobs in the Open queue, we need to work more efficiently.  A handout went around with new policies and although some of them were beneficial, most of them were either petty or nonsense.  2 in particular were total BS.  The early/late shift pattern was to be replaced with early (7:00-13:00)/day(9:00-17:00)/late (14:00-22:00) shift patterns, with the 7 members split 2/3/2 on the shift.  The new early and late shifts were to act as first line, taking calls and applying quick fixes.  We had 2 minutes to complete or hand off to the day shift - which was to say that we parked the call and waitied for Day shift to get around to it.

I had a few statistics I had collected regarding how the service desk operates.  I bring them up in the meeting and explain situations where the new policies would not work.  As you can imagine, I was over-ruled amd the new rules started the following day. Of all the new policies, the ""2 minutes per call"" rule was the worst. Not only did we have a mere 2 minutes to take a call, we had to attempt some troubleshooting and write up all the notes. If this was a new employee, we also had to add their details onto the system.

After a month, the department was in chaos. Because we could only work 2 minutes before handing it off to the day shift, there were a lot of calls for the three day shift workers to attempt to fix. The outstanding queue went from 100 calls to nearly 2000 in that month. The increase was partially helped by the fact that through a little malicious complaince, I maximised my time on every call. If I couldn't fix the call, I ensured that every call would take just under the 2 minute mark, then dumped them in the day shift call queue. Dropped calls (people who called and hung up) increased drastically, and one of the day shift team went on long-term sick due to stress.

Eventually the boss decided to come in early and see what the problem was. He sees me and another tech taking calls and stands over us while we work through the calls. We both take less than 2 minutes per call, and follow his rules to the letter. He has no reason to complain, but sees that the calls are dropping. With 2 people taking calls, 2 minutes per call and a peak of thirty calls around the 8:30AM time mean that lots of these calls drop then call back later.

Later in the shift, I see him checking call stats and see his face get red. He knows that his policy is not working.

The following day, Boss calls us all in to the meeting room and states that we must work harder or smarter. He tells us that we need to use the on-site support team to handle the logged calls instead of the day shift. We still had the 2 minute rule and the same staffing levels. I mentioned a couple of times that VIP's couldn't wait, and that we need 4 people taking calls from 8AM. I was told that the rules still stood.  We were also told that as several people had breached the 2 minute rule, any further breaches would start a disciplinary process.

The day after, we were told that on-site (desktop) support have no free slots for over a week, which is three times shorter than the dayshift's waiting times. Boss is in and instead of logging on to the phone to alleviate the pressure, he's simply floating around. As 8:30 rolls around, I answer yet another call - this was around my 30th of the day and there was 22 calls on hold waiting to be answered.  I answer with my usual organisational mandated greeting:

*Good morning, you're through to DPG on the IT Service desk.  Can I take your name or reference number please.*

Yes, it's a long greeting, but every customer facing call centre (there were something like 7 of them) had to use this greeting.  Then I hear the unmistakable voice of our Chief Executive.  According to even our new policies, he is given a greater priority.  He explains the problem - he's in a meeting room, 70 miles away attempting to turn on his laptop but he can't get past the encryption software. It's an easy fix, but takes ten minutes over the phone. I can't do it because of the 2 minute rule. I'm torn between dropping the calls or annoying the chief executive. Boss sees me hesitate and asks what's going on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** *Laptop encryption, he's in $distant\_town I...*

The boss shut me down

**Boss:** *Hand it off to on-site.*

I told him that they wouldn't be able to get out for over a week and that the dayshift could fix it, but this is stopping him from working.

**Boss:** *Dayshift is too busy, and you can't breach the 2 minutes.*

**Me:** *But it's ...*

**Boss:** *I don't care who it is, hand the call off, He told me before walking off.*

I took the details and apologised to the chief executive that I'd have to hand the call off. Made the notes on the call and gave the incident reference. After the calls slacked off, I printed the details of the call, ensured that the telephone call had been saved, and replayed it.  Although we had headsets, they actually picked up a fair amount of background noise.  Boss could clearly be heard giving me instructions.  I also printed a copy of the new SOPs and went for lunch.

I had just sat back down at my desk when I was called into the office of the head of IT. He chewed me out for leaving the Chief Executive without anything to present the council's vision of the future for $distant\_town. I was told that the Chief Executive wants someone's head (metaphorically) for the treatment, and that formal proceedings had started and I was to be suspended on full pay, and did I have anything to add?

I told the head of IT, that my boss had told me to do it, and when I started to explain about it, he walked away. I handed him the printed copies of the notes and told the Head of IT that if he pulled my phone log for that call, he could hear the boss shutting me down. Head of IT told me to stay where I was while he checked. An hour later, the Head of IT returned and apologised to me.  He told me that I could take the last hour off and return in the morning with no blemish on my record.

New boss was ""replaced"" (fired), and a new new boss was placed there, who had been promoted internally from a different team.  New new boss was well respected and had the reputation of actually listened to his staff.  We explained what had happened previously and he imediately tore up the new stupid rules and put us back to how it was.  The outstanding jobs queue took nearly a year to become manageable again.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cc1hgy,The Ghost of Register 5,"Not sure if this belongs here, but I guess the mods will take it down if not. 

Also, LTL, FTP, on mobile, yadda, yadda.

Background: I used to work in an outdoors store. The kind of store that sells clothing, equipment, and anything that can be used outdoors. If you live in the southern USA, you know this store.

It was another typical work day. Go in early to open as a Cashier, try to out on a happy face that shows I dont hate my job, leave, and come back in the next day. Again, typical for retail. However, during this all too ordinary day, we had someone try to apply for a credit card. So I called my lead, they headed over to another register to run their information, and that's where this story takes its turn. For some unknown, ungodly reason, the computer was inputting ""I"" and no matter how much you backspace, it would not stop. So being the tech savvy nerd that I am, offered to take a quick peek, in exchange for a snack (and to rid myself of people for 5 minutes). Lead agreed and let me do my ""wizardry"".

I know what you're thinking. It's a company register that rings out sales, what can you do to it? Well, without too much detail, Level 1 support. Power cycle? Nope? Replace keyboard? Nope. Check wires for damage? None. I was going to call it quits, but then a lightbulb went off. Something I should have known but just forgot in the heat of the moment. Like I said before, it was a register, but registers dont usually have a QWERTY keyboard, they have numbers and credit/debit buttons for....well transactions. Since this was also used for credit card applications, it had a QWERTY keyboard attached. Tracing the wire I found it leaned up against a stapler with was, as you guessed, on the ""I"". Move the stapler and all was fixed. Easiest snack win ever, and also looked like a genius.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cby3cm,Abused Laptop from Hell,"When I worked IT for a school a while back I would typically be in the back room working on user laptops and processing them to our warranty provider to replace broken ones.

I have helped friends and family with IT and have seen many bad customer laptops. Nothing would prepare me for what I was about to see. The screen was bent at a 30 degree angle, the screen was cracked, the ports had brown gunk deeply embedded inside of them, and the keyboard was literally falling apart with the keys disintegrating. I gave the beast a quick wipe off just so I could clean it enough to send it off for warranty. To add insult to injury it turned the wipe multiple different colors. After sending the laptop off to warranty I still remember the beautiful work order we had received.

t3_cbmcg6,Felt like an outcast for the first time ever in IT,"I started working for this company about 18 months ago and I always found it odd that instantly people started emailing me directly saying they would submit a ticket but they want my help and don't want anyone else in my department to help. Come to find out my department had absolutely horrible social skills and were just flat out rude and condescending to people when they were helping them (There have been times I have heard one of our sysadmins on occasion call people a fucking idiot in a conference call just to name one instance. Somehow they have never gotten in trouble for this.) . I brushed it off and went on my way. So back when I was really green with the company and still learning where everything was located and whatnot anytime I would ask for help I would get a smug response ""Figure it out on your own, or I had to do it myself so you can do it yourself"" I honestly couldn't believe myself, come to find out not one person in my IT department ever wanted to end up in IT ironically, they all hate what they do. I get made fun of constantly for having a mechanical keyboard and some gaming and horror movie related funko pop figurines on my desk because ""It's childish"" I have been on the hunt for a new job for a few months for something that I could call a long term home and potentially move up in positions, so I have really been struggling with tolerating my employees and all I can say is it's the little things people say that are just enough to make me continue a little longer here while looking for another job.

One of my ticket surveys came back today that just made me feel like I stand a little taller today.

""OP was extremely helpful with helping me with my situation. He solved my problem before the day was over. He went above and beyond in helping me with my problem and I appreciate his efforts and patience with me!!! ""

This was just enough to remind me that you can't let other people constantly drag you down because how you treat others can oftentimes have an equal effect on their day.

t3_cbrp1v,"Money for nothing, getting cracked for free","Monday morning. I can’t seem to stop it no matter how hard I try.

I try and muster enough vim and vigour to perform my daily sysadmin tasks like organising the offsite backups, checking on the trouble tickets raised over the weekend and performing the daily blood sacrifices required to keep the servers running. The office is quieter than usual due to an outbreak of the lurgy and half the employees have called in sick. This would normally be a good thing as things aren’t as busy, however the downside today is that Jnr Sysadmin is off sick and I’m not feeling too well myself.

Finishing up quickly, I was surprised to find that there was very little that needed doing and that everything was running smoothly. Immediately, I went on high alert. This is not normal. Like the calm before the storm, it was an indication that something is coming. I try and calm down by going through the spam email trap filter and cleaning out the weekend build-up of spam email. My boss mistakes the hunted look on my face and asks me if I am feeling unwell. I am but I will soldier on.

While wading through all the usual unwanted sales emails, business proposals from Saudi princes, offers of romance from women living right next door to me, leet haxor attempts from Outer Elbonia and laughable death threats, I receive an urgent call. It’s one of our branches managers

It seems that he has had an epiphany. He believes that his business managers need to revolutionise the way they sell finance packages for cars and this can only be achieved with the use of The Website. The Website will make them millions, solve all the world issues and spread peace and love throughout the universe. Without The Website, the company will be in dire straits within hours. I tune out his waffling, and start mentally playing “Money For Nothing” only to be brought back to reality with an almighty crash when he drops the bomb that they’ve already been trialling it for a couple of weeks now. They’ve been manually filling it up with customer data from our sales system and experimenting with it, but they have found it too slow for RDS users. Ignoring my screams of rage, he says they need this website up and running properly ASAP. Hanging up on him, I informed my boss and together we stormed over to our CFO’s office to notify him that our branch manager decided to get it into his head to transfer customer data to a third party company for no reason. Turns out Senior Management are aware of it and are trialling this website at this branch, but didn’t bother telling us. Asking Senior Management what is so special about this bloody website gets me blank stares, so I slope off back to my desk where my boss told me to concentrate on this website while he took the other incoming calls. This branch manager is known for running to the CEO and crying if he doesn’t get his way, and at this time of financial difficulty we don’t want the headache of explaining to the CEO our reasons for doing this, further adding fuel to the fire that will get us fired^1. I contact the website company to get setup with access so I can see this all dancing, all singing website for myself.

It’s an online spreadsheet with some reports.

It’s no different to the excel spreadsheet that this branch and the other branches have been using for years now. The only difference is that this spreadsheet has fancy animations to transition from one screen to another, which is what is causing the slowdown for RDS users.

What sort of certifiable lunatic looks at a spreadsheet and says “What this really needs is more flash animation!”?

I call the branch manager again and ask him what is so special about this website as I can’t see anything apart from a regular spreadsheet. He is so breath taken with the website that he can’t say a single thing that differentiates this from Excel, all he can come out with is that “we need it”.^2

I poke around the website myself, can’t find anything that can’t be found in Excel, then call up the website company to ask them what it so special about it. The customer sales rep agrees with me that there is no real difference between this and Excel apart from the fact we are now paying these people monthly for the privilege of using their spreadsheet.

I thought that car salespeople were immune to sales hype due to being asymptomatic carriers, now I know better.

After hanging up on the branch manager, I became aware of a one man commotion coming from my boss’s office. He’d been taking the calls while I was dealing with The Website (I’ve taken to kneeling when saying this) so I decided to take a break and wandered over to ask him what was going on.

One of our RDS users was transferring some money from his bank account when the bank called to notify him the transfer had been intercepted in a MITM attack and they had put a block to the transfer. They thought that one of our systems had been infected with some sort of malware that targets this bank specifically. Knowing I was busy with the CEO’s croney, he called our MSP to start the process going. I took over from my boss talking to the MSP, and we started putting a diagnosis plan into effect. We tracked it down to one particular server, and I was in the process off booting everyone off/isolating.

During this, I keep getting calls from the branch manager and his group of business managers asking about when this website would be working properly. Then they started getting ideas like getting laptops for all the financial staff so the website can run better and they can walk to the different buildings when customers are and do their deals. A bunch of people who I wouldn’t trust with an Etch-A-Sketch want laptops with financial and customer data loaded on them under guidance from a man who let his son install Steam and a bunch of games on his company laptop. I tell them to forget it and continue isolating the malware on this server. I’m at the point where I don’t care if the branch manager goes over my head and calls the CEO to complain that IT isn’t helping them do their job.

Maybe I’m being a dinosaur and been in the sysadmin game too long. I feel that keeping confidential data in house and using the tools at your disposal is better than paying for cloud services hosted by nebulous companies that have popped up overnight and can disappear at the drop of a hat. Whenever I hear the phrase “The Cloud” I mentally replace it with “Someone else’s computer”. I seem to be part of a disappearing generation that valued privacy, now I sit back and watch people shout to the world their most private information and think that it is no problem if they do the same thing with other people’s information. I really don’t know.

Me thinks it is time to become a goat farmer.

TLDR: Discovered certain people in our company are copying customer and financial data off to a third party company whose website they are having problems using, want looser restrictions on financial data. Trying to tell them no while tracking down malware in the system that is intercepting other types of financial data.

1 - The CEO made some discreet inquiries a while back as to whether or not he could get rid of the IT Dept to save some money. Thankfully, the rest of Senior Management (who work in the same building as us and see what we do day to day, unlike the CEO who turns up for half a day once a month and disappears again) told him to forget it. He still brings it up every now and then though. And yet they have money to piss away on this website.

2 - I remember the time when financial people used to live, sleep and breathe Excel. They could do insane things with it. Sure, the formulas would sometimes cause weird problems and they would sometimes go overboard and turn an excel spreadsheet into a full blown database. The point is they would be able to use it to their full advantage. I had a business manager from another branch call up two months ago and ask me how to do the sum of a group of cells. God only knows what they are being taught these days.


EDIT:  Was very happy yesterday.  I'm in Australia.  Telstra had a major fiber cut which took down a lot of businesses, including this website.  Started getting the calls earlier, couldn't keep the smile off my face when I told them it was outside our control and they couldn't access this website.

I could talk to them till I'm blue in the face, but sometimes they need to be shown the cold hard reality.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cbpoi4,Scrolling ghost? Seems legit.,"  

Just had an interesting one… 

Had a user complain there was a ghost in the PC making it scroll without pressing anything. Righto then, I followed him over and sure enough Win Explorer was scrolling, browser was scrolling, literally everything was scrolling without touching the mouse or keyboard.

Easy fix I thought: The mouse is buggy! Replaced it, still scrolling. Uninstalled drivers, still scrolling. Disabled the trackpad, still scrolling. Uninstalled trackpad drivers, still scrolling. Using nothing but CMD now… still scrolling. What the serious!? Ah! Down arrow is stuck! Replaced keyboard, still scrolling.

After a few restarts and head scratching begin thinking I’ll have to rebuild/replace the laptop because he needs to keep working. Then I notice his laptop bag next to the desk. I open it up and sure enough there is a Bluetooth mouse in there powered on. Switched it off and the ghost was evicted.

t3_cbpu3n,Teacher couldn't handle my answer as an intern,"Some background to the story, I was an IT intern for my school district and the main ""customers"" you might call them were our teachers at school and throughout the 40 plus schools in the district and enter mean spirited teacher.

Me - obviously a ghost

TP - Tech Partner

&amp;#x200B;

During the Summer some of the teachers are still working and have to do some things to make the next year start without a hitch, well at one of the elementary schools we service there is a teacher with a reputation of making someone's day terrible by just a word.

&amp;#x200B;

The ticket we got was to replace her smart board that had failed the last week of school and so TP and I both go to the school and replace this 75lb board and we're having a little difficulty and K is in the room with us and so we ask for help. She rudely declines, great so we have to manhandle this board by ourselves and mount it on these pegs that are actually quite large and helped the process and we got the board hung and everything went swimmingly.

Or so I thought.

&amp;#x200B;

two weeks later K puts in a ticket that she couldn't get her laptop screen on the projector, as this was a simple job I went without my TP and thought it would be a simple plug this in and mess with some settings. Geez was I wrong she starts complaining that the board was tacky and didn't match the wall (it's literally a whiteboard with a gray outline and it's mounted on a white wall, ""tacky"").

&amp;#x200B;

So I go over her settings completely ignoring the fact she pointed something out that I couldn't change and got the screen working. I left shortly after diagnosing the problem and made it back to my HQ successful until my boss came down to me, it's a multi-level structure and he seems a little agitated that she put a bad comment on the ticket because i ""ignored"" her.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's just say it has been two years since I worked there and boy am I glad I quit, because I had so many issues with the way some of the other Techs talked to me and that I couldn't make any money during the school year so I picked up another job.

t3_cbo01q,Always use protection,"(This is not my story, but I'm going to tell it in first person)

In a data center there are these devices called Power Distribution Units (PDUs). Imagine a large metal cabinet the size of a wardrobe that's responsible for routing electricity. One day, I had one open because I had to run repairs on it and couldn't shut it down as it was still routing power to a majority of the row. Naturally, I had on giant rubber gloves that go up to my elbows because I like not being electrocuted.

Meet Dave, the Security Bro. Dave thinks he is funny which is surprising because he doesn't generally think at all. He was making his rounds and came across me working on this monster and I warn him that it's live. He thinks it would be funny to play a game of ""How close can we get?"".

t3_cbn1ch,Nylon and Cotton can crash computers,"I saw the story about static electricity and it reminded me of this story.

&amp;#x200B;

In the late 80s I had a client who had about 20 generic stand-alone 286 computers. These were used for running spreadsheets and word possessing. Five of them were used by the partners PAs and would regularly crash while those used by the rest of the staff were as good as gold.

&amp;#x200B;

They were all identically set-up and if I swapped a unit from a PA with one used by a staff member there was no problem with the swapped computer when it was by the staff member. However the swapped computer used by the PA would suddenly start crashing.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the building had wooden floors, but the two senior partners area, their PAs and the meeting rooms had expensive carpet. However, the senior partners’ computers didn’t crash and the other PAs computers did crash, but not as often as the senior partners PA’s computers did.

&amp;#x200B;

I was fairly certain that the cause was down to static electricity so the client had the carpet treated to reduce static buildup and anti-static mats were placed under the chairs and desks. This vastly reduced the incidence of the crashes but did not eliminate them. So we started a log of who was using the computers and getting accurate times of when they crashed.

&amp;#x200B;

This narrowed it down to two people. One was the office junior, a 16 year old sweetie, and the other was the managing partner’s PA. She had a presence and ruled the practice with an iron fist. She terrified everyone including her boss.

&amp;#x200B;

We found out that the office junior was wearing a lot of cotton including her lingerie. No minds out of the gutter, we actually asked her after seeing her get zapped when she went to open a filing cabinet. However, no-one had the nerve to ask the managing partner’s PA what she wore.

&amp;#x200B;

The managing partner solved the problem by giving all the female staff members silk lingerie as a bonus. The men got a boozy weekend away. When the managing partner’s PA asked why lingerie, the office junior told her that it was her cotton clothing that was causing the computers to crash and that nylon fabric was apparently just as bad and by giving all the female staff the same she wasn’t seen to be taken advantage of. And yes the crashes stopped.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cbnza5,Interview has an interesting twist,"I’m currently an intern at a big tech company and as of late it’s been made clear only 3 interns are getting hired on full time out of a group of 15. I’m skeptical of my chances of being hired on full time so I started putting out feelers and applications to places I had existing connections. It’s all been great and due to my unique skill set I’ve gotten a few on phone interviews and one or two in person interviews. 

One of them is for a startup a professor of mine told me about. He said it was founded by one his best students and they were doing something cool. 

I get a recommendation from him and get in direct contact with the founder who then gives me all these reasons why they are cool and changing the world. It sounded really great and he was willing  to wait until my summer internship was over to get serious about recruiting me. He did however ask me to come in so we could talk about my skills and what I can do with the team. I’m all in and tell him I can see him anytime. 

I get there today and he seems a bit confused but brushes it off and tells me he likes my work and he’s excited about the possibility of us working together. We sit in their big open office setting and he starts quizzing me on what I know and what I can do. This is when things get strange. 

He asks me how long I’ve been working on Ruby which is a language I don’t know and how long I’ve worked with Java. I tell him I do t use Ruby but I’ve used java for a few years. He looks at my GitHub and is impressed to a degree but says he hasn’t seen anything I’ve done recently. 

I’m very confused at this point but I keep answering questions and we eventually get to talking about what he’s doing and what the office is like. 

He is dropping strange little bits of information about what I would be doing and he’s getting more and more detailed about what he would like to have me work on when I can. 

This is when I finally figured it out. He mentions a major tech company in the industry we work in and asks me what I did when I worked there. I just tell him I’ve never worked there to which he replies by opening up his ipad and pulls up my linked in. 

It’s my name but it has a whole list of skills and companies worked at that I’ve never seen. 

He has some other guys linked in up who didn’t have a profile picture and thinks this guy is me. This guy was under the impression I was some seasoned programmer who worked at major companies and wasn’t at all fazed when he heard I was interning at a place over the summer. 

I just had an interview where they interviewed me thinking I was someone else. I got out of there a while after when he asked me questions that were relevant to me and we both left soon after.

So I decided to try to remote into work to get some things done and found that I didn't have the VPN client installed on my home computer. So then this happened....  


Players:  
$Me: Me....duh

$OSA: Other sys admin (one with vpn access)

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: I've spent the last 15 minutes scouring my email, network info notes and history trying to remember the URL to download the Cisco VPN client from our ASA and I have been unsuccessful. My blood pressure is rising because I can't find/remember a simple URL.

&amp;#x200B;

I decide to start sending texts to my co-worker so he can get into our ASA and send me a OTP and enrollment certificate for my VPN. I remember there's a link in the email so I can stop wasting time. $OSA sends it over to me within a few minutes (yay his stuff is working).

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: I downloaded the certificate but the url, [school-asa.school.com/](https://school-asa.school.com/) doesn't get me the client. I tried adding /admin to the end but that was wrong. None of my credentials for cisco or my school were working and I kept getting login errors when trying to get passed the splash page.   


$OSA: Have you tried the main admin account?

$Me: \*headdesk\* No....

So I try that and YUP! Those worked. So I finally download the client and install the certificate. Then I load the client and the certificate doesn't appear to have loaded. I restart the client...still no certificate loading for me to connect. I reboot computer, twice, still nothing. I start googling the fail points and other things trying to learn WHY this isn't working. It's supposed to be simple. I'm not a Luddite...I should be able to do this.  


$OSA: Did you type [school-asa.school.com](https://school-asa.school.com) into the client manually? 

$Me: \*headdesking again\* No.....  


Lo and behold...it worked when I typed it in manually and I connected to the VPN. It shouldn't have been so hard. But I haven't had to set it up in over 2 years and I just plain forgot all the simple steps. I went straight for the complicated problems. Not my finest hour.",talesfromtechsupport

I work at a small MSP. With small, I mean, there are four of us and two and a half of us are techs. We do a lot of things, if it plugs in and have a network, we support it for our customers. They are usually small, 2 to maybe 150 people, anything from offices to construction. Being a small company, I do everything. Even if my main job is to handle servers and networks, I still take T1 calls.


I had just settled down for a Friday after lunch in the middle of vacation time of the year. Things were dead quiet all week so I was working on trying to get my head around python. I’m going to need to know it sooner or later, so by Omnissiah, I was going to beat my head against it until I learned it. Even if it was by imprint on my skull.


No such luck though as my phone rang. I picked up the headset to accept the call.


dRaidon: “$SMALLMSP, this is dRaidon.”


We’re a small company, working for small companies. Most of which is made up of what would go as blue collar workers. We actively try not to sound like the usual ‘help desk’ they have to talk to when calling ISP or Tv provider or something.


$Client: “Hello, this is $Client from $MEDIUMSIZEDCLIENT. I’m having trouble printing.”


Didn’t recognize the name. Not too unusual, we support something like three thousand users in total even if most I interact with the managers and frequent flyers.


dRaidon: “Sure, I should be able to do something about that. Can you open up $REMOTESOFTWARE so I can take a look?”


Meanwhile, I’m already logging into their server. Or trying to at least. VPN wouldn't connect.
I really wish I could get people to spring for monitoring, I really do. But people are cheap.


$Client: “It’s not working.”


dRaidon: “Yes, I can see that… I can’t seem to be able to connect to your network. Can you get online?”


$Client: “I was having trouble with the google. It didn’t work, so I reset the router.”


They have a business grade router. VPN tunnels, routing rules. Firewall rules. A lot of them. Sure, we had a backup config, but that was from the install date. A metric ton of stuff had changed since then and they didn’t want a service deal, rather to pay for each hour worked. So no further backups taken.


I stared at my screen for several seconds as my brain rebooted before I spent another couple pondering if it was too late to change career. Maybe something involving puppies? 


dRaidon: “You did what?”


$Client: “Yeah, that always work at home.”


There was a small mumble of talking in the background before he spoke up again.


$Client: “Now internet isn’t working for $OtherClient across the hall either. Is the server down?”


dRaidon: “...It seems like you are having a bit of trouble with your network, it’s not something I can fix remotely. I would need to head out to you for that. When would be a good time?”


$Client: “As soon as possible. We can’t work like this, you really should make sure your gear works. I think we pay for better service than this.”


I reached for my cup of tea. Took a long sip. Contemplated getting a new one.


dRaidon: “Sure thing. I’ll pack up and head out to you as soon as possible.”


We hung up, I logged the call and then went and got another cup of tea first. They were two towns over, a hour and a half drive from the office. Then I'd need to do a complete router rebuild. Followed by driving back home to get home late.

Printer: Magenta Toner Is Low, Reorder Toner.


Printer is around 13 years old, been abused by this department for years with heavy printing. I’ve frankensteined several times to keep it up and running.  Also we use refurbished toner cartridges for the old cow.


Rolled eyes, gave the printer a power enema the printer to clear any blockage in the pipe if any.  Trot back to desk and replied to email “That was no error message. Just a low toner message. You can still print to it. You can also print to the Ricoh printer (Big Bertha) over yonder.” Not sure why I mentioned this as informing people of other printers to use and walk to is the equivalent of the Bataan Death March to some people. 


Retail1: Okay, do we have toner for printer?


Got back up and changed the magenta cartridge with a new one, figured that they will still not understand the concept of the message. (Forget trying to save money hahaha)


Replied back that toner was changed.  Wondering if these people call a mechanic if the low fuel light comes on in their car.

t3_cbknmk,Yet another “funny ticket competition ain’t so funny” anecdote,"I’m pretty sure everyone’s seen something like this at least once, because I got something like this all the way back to my apprenticeship. 

Anyway, at my current contract for a international app company, I’m flicking through emails when I get pinged by a senior global manager (gently) reprimanding a senior site manager.

Turns out, the one getting reprimanded began a competition for strange tickets - the two first ones were from Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The first went something like “please send wired mouth”. The second said something like “battery of laptop was swallowed” (thanks, Apple products). 

The main issue was that this was sent to *every* IT personnel worldwide - *including random contractors like me, a few VPs, and the IT staff from those locations* - and the tickets weren’t anonymized - links, employee info, et centers were kept. (This went both ways, since another site manager and a tier 2 in Asia joined in and I could see a lot...) On top of that, there’s the obvious issue of poking fun at English mangling when a lot of the company is ESL. 

No top-of-the-chain head-rolling, since the global manager (plus another site manager who pointed out it’s best to think about how might the users take the mocking, which is important for a global corporation that has a lot of people going from office to office) apparently knew the site manager, and no irritated messages from execs. We all did get an apology and promise to do better from the site manager.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_cbbokr,That doesn't go in your password section,"A silly tidbit from today. Backstory I work in a small company that covers about 30 different sites around the state, handling everything from questions to troubleshooting computers, password resets, small projects where onsite IT needs help getting something installed or changed on 5-50 computers. 

Our clients are normally very nice, a little over cautious when it comes to things like UAC popping up ""do I hit yes or no to run this program that's been on my desktop for years?"" Which is good, better than a handful of sites that click everything that shows up on screen and end up getting a virus on the whole network. 

Anyways, today a lady emails us, asking if her PC is ready for a 3rd party website logon. I dont see why not, unless the link to the site doesn't work in a browser then you should be fine. 

She had gotten an email from the 3rd party support with links to the site, her username to use, and a new password reset link dubiously named ""NEW PASSWORD"", and it goes to a hyperlink. I click the hyperlink on my own PC and it takes me the official website and shows me a page to reset my password. Pretty nifty really, it was a link made especially for her account so she can change the password. 

I log in remotely and leave a message on screen for her, it blinks in the taskbar 99% of the time and sits in the background. You click it and ta-da, there's support asking a question and waiting for you.

Takes her a good 30 minutes to finally click the blinking icon on the taskbar, and she states she cant reset her password. Strange, the link should have worked. I ask her to show me what's happening. She clicks the first link sent to her, which goes straight to the login page. Username is spelled correctly, and then pastes a 50+ digit code (all *** since it's in the password section) in as the password. Ok, that's a red flag. 

Another question, have you changed your password yet? 

Her: ""I cant, I need to logon to the site first to change my password.""

I'm working alone today and let out a hearty chuckle to myself, thankfully I'm not on the phone with her. 

She was copying the entire hyperlink and pasting it into the password area, and trying to logon. I copy the link from the email she sent earlier, open a new tab, paste it, it goes to the password section. I tell her to please create a new password. New password is created and it automatically loads the logon page, what a nifty site. She jumbles the username on first try, **hospital** is a tricky word sometimes and it's easy to forget the T.  Shes able to logon.

In her defense, the email does show,

Username: yournamehere

Another day, another coffee.

I've been at my new job at $LocalGovt2 for about 9 months now. It's great. Tons of stuff to do, lots of legacy to fix with latest and greatest. Every day feels too short because I'm having a great time.

I take a sip of my coffee as I check out this morning's ticket titles: Password, password, password, haunted printer, password. Guess I'll start with haunted printer.

I call $BrotherHater, who recently moved to a new office, and he said that his printer in his previous office has reinstalled on his $BigBox laptop we gave him. It's an older laptop that we just reimaged (as he wasn't on the list to get a new one). He deleted the printer, and it came back the next day! He said that $BunglingShadowIT set it up for him years ago on his old computer, and that she took a long time to get it working.

Ok...so the printer is probably pushing down via GPO. But it's interesting that $BunglingShadowIT installed it. She left the company a few months ago (I'm not calling her), but she shouldn't have had access to set up a GPO for him. Something doesn't quite sound right.

I check the printer mapping GPO - it isn't in there. I run some gpresult queries remotely - nothing out of the ordinary in there. We put the ticket on hold as it wasn't the standard issues - I asked $DTGrunt to give him one of the new $PrinterCompany laptops temporarily, see if the issue goes away, and call me when she's done replacing it:

* $DTGrunt - ""Vulture, the printer isn't automatically installing on this new loaner $PrinterCompany laptop, but I just verified that it's reinstalling itself on the old laptop. I don't have any idea what's going on here.""
* Vulture - ""Neither do I. I still haven't found a GPO that contains this printer, but I haven't finished looking. I'm going to check the ticketing system before I go further.""
* $BrotherHater, in the background at his desk - ""It's obvious to me what's going on! The printer is out for revenge!!""

So I dig through old tickets and eventually come across a ticket submitted by $BrotherHater 2 years ago requesting that this printer gets installed on his $BigBox Desktop 1, $BigBox Desktop 2, $BigBox Laptop 1, and any other computer that he logs into, but not his $FirmwareDeath Tablet 1 or his $PrinterCompany Desktop 1. Ticket has no notes other than ""Request closed"" by....$DTGrunt? I'm not even seeing that $BunglingShadowIT even worked the ticket.

Either way? mehhhhhhhhh - What a stupid ticket.

So the printer did indeed install on a $BigBox Laptop, and it didn't install on a $PrinterCompany Laptop. Maybe it's a GPO by manufacturer? That would make sense then. But there's still no GPO that I'm seeing. We didn't reuse a computer name either. Either way, something isn't right with the GPOs - time to do a deeper dive. Last time I had an issue like this, there was an old corrupt GPO that wasn't visible in GPMC anymore. I'll check the sysvol policies folder with my admin account vs the user's account and compare folder names.

Sure enough, there were a bunch of policies that the user couldn't see (because restrictions) which was expected. However, there were also 2 policies that my domain admin couldn't see but the user could! Armed with UIDs of the GPOs and lots of hopes and dreams, I tackle how to take ownership of a GPO and then copy permissions from a new blank default permissions GPO (aka Good GPO) to overwrite the bad one:

    #UIDs edited to protect the identities of minors
    Import-Module ActiveDirectory
    
    $NewOwner = ""adminvulture""
    $DNBadObject = ""CN={D96AD4A1-11B8-413F-863D-C51E18990208},CN=Policies,CN=System,DC=domain,DC=org""
    $DNGoodObject = ""CN={2B66A8C0-7D28-41E0-A405-273259A1B829},CN=Policies,CN=System,DC=domain,DC=org""
    
    $ACLBadObject   = Get-Acl -Path (""ActiveDirectory:://RootDSE/"" + $DNBadObject)
    $AcctNameNewOwner   = Get-ADObject -Filter {sAMAccountName -eq $NewOwner} -properties sAMAccountName
    $ACLNewOwner = New-Object System.Security.Principal.NTAccount($AcctNameNewOwner.sAMAccountName)
    $ACLBadObject.SetOwner($ACLNewOwner)
    Set-Acl -Path (""ActiveDirectory:://RootDSE/"" + $DNBadObject) -AclObject $ACLBadObject

At this point, I'm able to check the permissions enough to see that all default groups have Deny privileges except for GROUP POLICY CREATOR OWNER, which has read/write, and $BrotherHater. Now to replace the permissions and actually edit this GPO in GPMC:

    Get-Acl -Path (""ActiveDirectory:://RootDSE/"" + $DNGoodObject) | Set-Acl -Path (""ActiveDirectory:://RootDSE/"" + $DNBadObject)

I do this and determine that we've got a few GPOs created by this user before she lost her GROUP POLICY CREATOR OWNER privileges. In total, after doing an even deeper dive, she had 17 GPOs fully hidden from Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins. Nothing nefarious, but it explained some of the weird ass issues we've sporadically seen. But in a mountain of GPOs (hundreds of them), 17 that are actually hidden weren't easy to find when you are denied the ability to see them.

yadda yadda incident report, yadda yadda AD built-in groups audit.

I later learn that $DTGrunt closed the ticket without doing anything, and $BunglingShadowIT took care of it when the user was complaining about inconsistent printers. WMI lookups of computer manufacturer and WMI lookups of last logged in user is how the printer was deployed - how in the hell did it even work reliably??

tl;dr - Shadow GPOs created by ShadowIT caused random trap cards until those GPOs were sent to the Shadow Realm by Blue Eyes White VulturE.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_cb3htk,Problem Exists Between Keyboard and Keyboard,"This happened just this morning.  I work at the Service Desk for a local company with about 1,000 employees with many many remote locations and field workers through the Midwest.  One of my primary responsibilities is computer rollouts, both to new users and regularly scheduled upgrades.  To facilitate this, I have a build rack at my desk consisting of a KVM and Gigabit Ethernet switch I use to work on desktops, so I can do about 4 at a time (not that impressive, but it's enough for what we need).  This is in addition to my laptop, also safely docked at my desk with external keyboard, mouse, and dual monitors, cuz around here Service Desk gets the good stuff.  Build rack is behind me, laptop in front, I can get to all without even moving my chair much, just swiveling.

This morning I was building some desktops (the little Ultra Small Form Factors that look like they're just an external harddrive to the uninitiated) to upgrade on of our remote locations from Win7 to Win10.  Part of this process when replacing in-place desktops is to look up the machine in our management console to see what software needs to be installed on the new laptop (there are better solutions to this, but we're small).  I was getting a machine past the initial Ghost image and updates, and decided while that's running to look up its software report to save time, so I swivel my chair back over to my laptop, pull up my Excel sheet of machines to rollout, and go to ctrl-c ctrl-v the name into our management console.

Nothing changes.

Weird, but doesn't faze me as this console is notoriously slow.  I wait a bit, and then notice the name in the search box hasn't changed at all.  Huh.  I got back to my spreadsheet with the mouse and try again.  Nothing.  I try again and again.

Then I finally look down at my hands.

My right hand was on my mouse connected to my laptop just as it should be.

My left was on the keybord... attached to the KVM on my build rack, happily trying to copy-paste nothing.

I gave myself a hearty facepalm, laughed at myself for being the User today, and put my hand back on my laptop keyboard where it belongs.

t3_cawze6,"“Please help, I’m not dead.”","The average age of the customer base for the company I worked for is 65. Lots of our customers are significantly older than that. A cool aspect of the job was the chance to work repeatedly with the same customers. You’d build those mini-relationships that were engaging and often humorous. 

A downside to dealing with a customer base like that meant a lot of the basic issues. “The sound is broken...” (accidentally muted the PC.) or “Half my Internet is missing...” (minimized web page, dragged partially off-screen) and so on, and so forth. 

One of my favorite calls I ever got was from Judy. Judy was in her late 80s, and one day Facebook decided she was dead. 

She logged on one day to find her account in memorial format. She wasn’t able to post, or do much else. She called me in fury. 

Judy: “FACEBOOK THINKS I AM DEAD. I AM NOT DEAD.”

Me: “Judy! I’m glad you’re not dead! It’s wonderful to speak with you again. How can I help?”

Judy: “I need you to tell Facebook that I’m not dead.”

Me: “Of course, lets take a look at that.”

(Attempts to log into Facebook...)
(Can’t log into Facebook) 

Me: “Okay Judy, it looks like we can’t log in. Let’s try looking you up publicly.”

Judy: “THAT’S WHAT I DID IT SAYS I’M DEAD.”

Me: “Okay Judy I-“

Judy: “I’M NOT DEAD. IT’S WRONG.”

Me: “I know Judy! I’m on the phone with you!”

Judy: “TELL FACEBOOK THAT I’M STILL ALIVE. I’M NOT DEAD.”

Me: “Alright Judy, I can’t call ‘em up, but let’s send them an e-mail.”

Judy: “WHY WOULD THEY ANSWER AN E-MAIL FROMS SOMEONE THEY THINK IS DEAD??!”

Me: “They have a system for responding to this issue. They’ll take care of you. Lets submit your name and e-mail.”

Judy: “...Okay. They better respond to me. I’m not dead.”

t3_cb1ftm,Did you ground yourself?,"Keeping it short and sweet for my first post; this just happened. I'm not a support tech, just a dev who likes to read stories.

Guy comes into work (early 20s, software developer) with a graphics card he bought. He's recently inherited a desktop from another dev and he decides he's gonna install this graphics card in the company computer (probably to run 3 monitors, I did this myself a few years ago, ^(don't tell the sysadmin)).

He lays the desktop on the *carpet* and opens her up and install his fancy new card; A few minutes later and the unit is plugged back in but not responding to the power button. Most of you probably already know how important it is to ground/earth yourself when working with delicate electronics and may have sensed where this is going: He never grounded himself and has now shorted the motherboard.

1. I submitted and got the PO for FM. I need an invoice for our BK's to pay for the maintenance contract. I request an invoice from FM
2. FM responds oh we need a copy of the PO before we can send an invoice. Uhmmmm OKAY arghhhh. No biggie but just sayin'
3. Send a copy of the PO. FM responds back that they didn't get the attachment. Resend it.
4. OK so now we (FM) have to co-opt another guy into the email chain. You know to actually process the PO to create an invoice so our BK's can pay the invoice. With the PO.
5. I get this email ""The form is blank. Can you sign the attached form? Also, is the PO reference number XXXX-XX? If so, and you sign the attached, please reference that. Top left, customer PO#""
6. I just really couldn't help muhself because I really had no idea.

Your directions are not clear to me. What form is blank? Did the PO come through or is it blank? I signed the attached form. What am I to reference and where do I put that? The PO# or the Quote #? Am I supposed to put my PO# in the spot on the invoice that says PO#? Or in the header to the email response.

Sorry guy but you know what you're asking and I haven't a clue. Your directions are a little ambiguous. Hope I got it right. If not I'll try again.

t3_cav0lw,User gets me right in the feels.,"Last week was ROUGH. 

I've only been at this new organization for a month, so I'm still a little green, my supervisor went on vacation, we had a huge office move / reorg take place, tons of new hires to deal with, one of my co-workers got sick and another hurt his back on the job so I've been picking up tons of slack PLUS I needed to finish a proof of concept for an internal tool that I'm trying to get approved for use...lots of work, lots of stress, but I pulled it off. Perhaps the results were a little rough in places, but damn if I wasn't proud of myself.

At the end of today, a new user reaches out asking for us to review their permissions. Apparently, in my rush last week, I created her account but didn't assign it...anything, so she basically had access to...almost nothing.

Despite this incredibly amateurish mistake on my part, her ticket ends with:


""Thank you! (ps, you're doing a great job! Thanks for getting my other support ticket taken care of so quickly)""


Literally copy-paste.

I almost started crying...that tiny bit of recognition after last week's hell got me right in the feels. HARD. It was completely out the blue too. Not that I think crying is strange, I'm just not the kind of guy who cries at stuff like *this*.

If you're reading this and your IT people are trying, give 'em a pat on the back every once in a while. It apparently goes a long way.

&amp;#x200B;

It's summer session right now, so we're mostly dealing with incoming freshmen who need help getting used to the $University's online services, faculty who need a password reset, and alumni needing help with their transcripts.

This call was.... odd.

$Me: Technology Service Desk, this is $UnderpaidUndergraduate, how can I help you?

$User: Yes, I need help getting to the $Canvas? I'm taking an online course and I found this page, do I need to buy a trial?

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for clarity, Canvas is a third-party tool used by a number of universities. It allows professors to post documents, grades, assignments, and links for students. And student can submit assignments directly. At $university, not all classes use it, it's up to the professor's discretion. Normally you see it in lower division courses with larger class populations, and online-only courses.

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: I think you went straight to their website, if you're enrolled in a course that uses Canvas, you can just go to canvas.$University.edu

&amp;#x200B;

$User: Oh? You mean my start page?

$Me: If you set that as your homepage, then yes. Can you try going there?

$User: I just see my class there. It says $University Canvas, is this it?

$Me (confused): Yes, that is it. This is your class, right? Is there another class that should be showing up that isn't?

$User: But professor said I should be able to see my assignments here, I just see a box with the name of my class here!

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: You aren't able to access the class? What happens when you click on it?

$User: Oh, I hadn't tried that. Oh, the page changed. How do I access my assignments? I have an assignment due in two days!

$Me: Do you see anthing on the left hand sidebar that says ""Homework"" or ""Assignments""

&amp;#x200B;

$User: I see...she then proceeds to list every item instead of just looking for the words. ""Assignments"" was the seventh item down.

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: That! Click that!!

&amp;#x200B;

$User: Okay...

\--5 minutes of guiding her on how to open an assignment later--

&amp;#x200B;

$User: It says I need to write a 2-3 Pages long Word doc, but not to use pages, because it's not readable sometimes. How do I do that?

$Me: You... type the assignment up in Word. Then you submit the document to the assignment on canvas.

$User: How do I do that?

$Me: You type it up in Word. If you don't have Word, then you can go to the library --

&amp;#x200B;

$User: But it says I can't use pages!! How do I type two to three pages without using pages!

$Me: No, pages is the name of the Apple version of Word. Like Ford makes a truck, and Chevy makes a truck, but they have different names but do the same thing. You have to use Word to make the document instead of the program called Pages.

&amp;#x200B;

$User: I don't have word! I have Office365! And I can't go to the library because I live $CityThatsThreeHoursAway

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: Office365 is a bundle of programs. Word is one of them. Your local library should have publicly available computers you can use as well.

&amp;#x200B;

$User: How do I open it?

$Me: It would be in your applications folder...

&amp;#x200B;

$User: How would I know where that is!

$Me: Do you see the icon with the little face? The Finder icon on your dock?

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: Click that.

\--Five minutes of explaining how to open a program --

&amp;#x200B;

$User: Oh!! This thing!

$Me: Yes, once you type up your document in here, you just submit it.

$User: What does that ***MEAN?!***

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: You know how you had the assignment open? There should be a submit button. You click that, and a window will pop up.

&amp;#x200B;

$User: And then what?

$Me: You select the document.

&amp;#x200B;

$User: So I can just type the name of the paper?

$Me: The name of the file. So what ever you save it as, you just go there in that little computer and click the document.

&amp;#x200B;

$User: Oh, like when I do the save-as . But I do that in Word! Not in the finder thing!

&amp;#x200B;

\-- five minutes of explaining what a file is--

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: If I write a thing on a piece of paper in a notebook, I take it out of that notebook, and put it in a manilla file folder, and put that in my desk drawer, that's where that is saved. So Word is like a notebook. Once you save it, you're putting it in a folder somewhere in your computer. You need to know where you saved it.

&amp;#x200B;

$User: How would I know where I saved it?

$Me: When you save the document, and that little window pops up, that's you telling the computer where to save the file.

&amp;#x200B;

$User: Oh okay. It seems that these online courses aren't really geared for people like me! I haven't had to use a computer since 1981! I just wanted to take this one online course, and my $Son-In-Law helped me out. When I was a senior in college in *1976* we did everything with punchcards!

&amp;#x200B;

$me: *Screaming internally, and externally with mic muted*

$user: So, can you help me set up my student email?

$Me: If you're enrolled in courses, you've already set up your student email. There is absolutely no way for you to be enrolled in courses without having gone through the sign up process. Your canvas log in *is* your student email.

&amp;#x200B;

$user: Oh, my $Son-in-law set all that up for me. Can you look me up?

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: Can I have your student ID number?

$User: How would I know my Student ID number? I don't think I ever got one.

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: It would have been emailed to you when you were accepted for enrollment. You use it to set up your email address.

&amp;#x200B;

$User: Thank you! Sorry, but I just haven't really used computers for about thirty years now. I have a work email, but that's not my school email is it?

&amp;#x200B;

$me: no, no it's not.

$User: Oh well. It's not that bad. Worst case scenario is I can't get this assignment in and I just lose the thousand on the class. No biggy.

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: *Screams in Broke AF College Student*

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: User doesn't know what a file is, doesn't know what a program is, still thinks of computer programs as those things run off of punch cards, and makes me stay a half hour past my shift. I cut a metric ton of back and forth. I had to explain what powerpoint was ""Oh, it looks like little business cards!"" Her son-in-law had set up her student account, enrolled her in classes, and hadn't written anything down for her so she didn't know any of her own account information. She doesn't understand that computers have files, or what a folder/directory was. She wasn't able to read instructions like ""click here to upload"". She thought it was a bit unfair that the *online class* that she signed up for required *that she know how to operate a computer*.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit2: I've had a few people ask me. Yes, I did try several times to get her to go to someone in person, like a local library that she had access to, and also to contact the professor for accomodation, like submitting the documents via email instead of canvas. No dice.

t3_caq8zb,The Onboarding from Hell,"Details deliberately vague.

I do not work in tech support. I’m actually in sales, but often fill more operational needs for our small office of 14 people. This is a story about being appointed to run the on-site portion of a remote support on-boarding.

*The Backstory*

Accountant=really nice, intelligent, but overworked guy from the finance side of things. Good common sense but little background in technology.

Me=Lowly sales guy that has light tech knowledge from running in-house server and desktop support at a previous job.

Boss=head honcho in the office.

RS=Remote Support worker, knows what they’re doing.

—

A few months ago, an accountant gives me this packet of paper with a bunch of fill-in-the-blanks requesting information about our various office needs (router IP’s, subset mask #’s, VOIP systems, etc). He says it’s been hanging out on his to do list for too long and asks me to get as far as I can on it. I fill it out and hand it back to him.

I hear nothing for a few weeks, then get a PDF requesting more info about TV’s, ISP, printer models, etc. No problem; I fill it out, send it back, and once again hear nothing for weeks.

I get into the office one morning, and it’s already buzzing with that energy of chaos. People are walking around, taking pictures of computer serial numbers and office desks. Someone hands me a print out of an email from RS with some highlighted sections and asks me to take pictures of various computers. 

I go into the first office, and the occupant asks me why people keep taking pictures of the computer. Cue red flag #1; we have no organization as to who’s doing what or what we’ll do with the pictures.

I go into the main office area and get everyone to hold up for a second; we have an impromptu meeting, decide who’s handling what, and create a google drive folder for all the photos.

While this works a little better, we still wind up with a photo dump of probably 70+ unlabeled photos. But this is what I was requested to do, so I send the link over to the accountant.

It’s about this time that I notice the rest of the email. 

“I have emailed you multiple times on [these dates] in response for your request for *another* phone call. Since I have not heard back and your on-boarding was scheduled for [date over two months ago], I am emailing you with an outlines request for additional items we need to complete this service.”

The rest is a strongly worded paragraph indicating noteworthy irritation. 

I can only imagine what our unlabeled photo dump will do to this poor individual.

*The Event*

A few more weeks go by, and I get forwarded an email from RS stating that the onboard had failed due to us not knowing the administrator passwords on four machines. You can tell RS is at wit’s end. They request we reset the machines and give them the admin login.

The email is already a week old by the time I get it late on a Friday. The final on-boarding is evidently scheduled sometime Monday, so I come in Sunday to reset the computers. 

Two machines are Mac’s and the other two are PC’s. I get three of them reset without much issue, but one of the older Mac’s is running into an issue I’ve seen before with failure during boot or no fan-spin when the power button gets pressed. I drain the SMC, plug it back in, and it’s going along just jolly. 

I manage to format the drive but on one of the reset cycles the machine fails to turn back on. SMC reset doesn’t work, so I leave the machine with the power button depressed for a few minutes while I go do other stuff. 

I come back, do a PRAM reset just for kicks, and the machine turns back on. The OS is installing and all these puppies are chugging away just fine. I figure I’d just come into the office Monday morning to set up the admin accounts and go home.

Monday rolls around, and Mac#2 is dead. I get two starts but it shuts down while booting. No dice. I set up the admin accounts for one PC and the other Mac, but the fourth PC has already had a user create an admin account and I do not have the password. User is nowhere to be found, so I just reset the system again. 

Accountant comes running up somewhat frantically.

“Is it okay for me to give your personal # to RS?”

Me: “Sure.”

Accountant: “Okay; RS will text you. Can you handle the onboarding?”

Me: “Yup, when is it?”

“It was supposed to start half an hour ago.”

Me: “...Okay, but two machines are not ready.”

Accountant: “I thought you were going to do it over the weekend.”

Me: “I did, but Mac 2 is having a hardware issue and PC 4 got locked out by [user] so I had to reset it again.”

Accountant looks at the Mac: “Oh! You have it plugged into a bad outlet. I got it working yesterday by unplugging it and plugging it into this outlet.”

He tries, to no avail. I mention that unplugging it can drain the capacitors and help with booting, but he shrugs and goes back to his office.

Later on, Boss comes up to me and says “Mac 2 was working fine before you worked on it this weekend. What happened?” 

I explain that it’s a relatively common issue, do an SMC reset, and show it failing at boot. Boss once again implies that I broke the machine. I once again mention cap failures and hint that *maybe it had to do with [user] dropping the machine* a few weeks ago. Boss shuts up.

Back to onboarding. RS sends me a text indicating her displeasure with the delay.

“Are you having issues with the links? I don’t see you live.”

Me: “Accountant is sending them over.”

RS: “I have very limited time, there’s another onboarding scheduled in an hour. Please get all 4 machines online.

I get the links and log in to two of the computers. I can see RS at an admin login, so I text over the password. Remember this is a text conversation.

Me: “Only two of the machines are serviceable.”

Me: ”JambaJuice1234”

RS: “Why?”

Me: “I like Jamba Juice.”

RS: “No. why are only two machines serviceable?”

Me: “Oh. [explains situation]”

RS: “These machines *aren’t even serviceable*??”

Me: “sorry :(“

t3_cao6kh,The Promiscuous Floppy Disk,"Way back in the dark ages when computers were running Windows 3.1 and DOS 5.0 we didn't have fancy networks for getting data pushed around.  I worked for a major super market chain on their helpdesk in the mid to late 90s.  They had a PC in the office for doing the books.  The bookkeeper would put in the information.  I'm honestly not sure what was done from there.   I know the store director used it for figuring out the next week's projected sales and needed coverage.  I believe the register information was actually beamed back to home base over frame relay.  So, immediacy was an issue, and getting information disseminated could be a problem.    


In one particular division, we had a division manager that wanted all the book keeper information from each store.  So, he would go around to each store, and copy the information to a floppy diskette.  That Floppy diskette got around.  Unfortunately, so did the virus it was carrying.  When I saw a major spike in hard drive replacements (we didn't have Antivirus back then at the stores), I tried to figure out what was going on.  After a couple of weeks I finally tracked it down to a floppy this division guy would bring around.  We told him to stop, and he refused.  He said he needed the information off those computers.  That was the only way to get it.  (He wasn't wrong about it being the only way).  I ran this up to my manager.  She got involved and he still would not relent.  (All new hardware was charged to the IT organization... so technically, all the work we were doing, and all the hard drive replacement s ($1k each) were not coming out of the division's budget.  


Now, there really wasn't a good way to clear this.  People on site were mostly clueless.  The Division was mostly worse.  Our hard drives were all identical, and Antivirus was not even considered, because what the division guy was doing he wasn't supposed to be doing.  The computers should never have to have a floppy loaded into them, unless it was for troubleshooting purposes.  After a few weeks, and several thousands of dollars of replacements, we got the OK to start charging the division for the hard drive replacements.  Now, if you are not familiar with Supermarkets, they operate on razor thin margins.  Most run at 1-3% margins and 3% is really on the high side.  So, all the sudden, this division gets hit for several thousands of IT related expenses and more coming in daily.  The very irate division head sees his margins (and bonus) shrink precipitously and finds out why we are charging them.  He had a long talk with his division guy about how to use computers and how he has to listen to the IT people.    


So, after several weeks of this, computer issues from a virus going around all because this guy had to slip his floppy into every computer he was responsible for, we finally got this fiasco to stop.  It was a major pain.   


I honestly understand not knowing, but continuing to damage computers AFTER you are told, repeatedly is just plain stupid.  Especially when it cost so much money.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_cae4b4,The time I had to buy 4 computers because the Intelligence folks were not...,"So this is from my days as a Navy Supply Officer.   I want to start by saying the three Intel folks I'm diming out are not stupid, this was a one time thing. Also this is computer related but the IT folks were not really involved.  Anyway...

So I get called into the Operations center one day.  I'll summarize what I was told.  Training a new guy and they asked him to pull up some document to see how much he knew.  He decides that the first place to look is Google. Sure enough, he pulls up the document with the bright red Secret stamp on it.  Someone (not in my unit) had REALLY  fucked up.  

Now for those who don't know, the US military maintains two worldwide computer networks, one for NoForn/Classified/Secret/TS, and one for unclassified data (SIPRnet and NIPRnet).  Also, any device that touches classified data of any type becomes part of the SIPR side.

So the computer that pulled up the document, as well as the monitor and I think even the keyboard and mouse, have to be replaced since they can no longer be attached to NIPR and the internet. Up to this point no one in my unit did anything wrong.  Now let's talk about military intelligence. 

Intello, his chief, and his 1st class all hear about this and can't believe it,  so ALL THREE of them Google the document and pull it up on THEIR NIPR computers. So instead of buying one new computer I had to buy 4...grumble.  One extra computer I could see, but Intel's space was smaller than some closets I have seen, all three of them could see each other's screens easily, so why did all three of them taint their machines?

And before everyone else points it out, yes it is silly to replace those machines, since the only Secret doc they touched was literally on the internet.  But regs are regs.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_ca27pl,"Ancient history, how a VT100 became a computer","G'day, first post from a retired IT bloke.

This is ancient history and funny (I think).

Background. Back in the 1970's and 80's I worked as a programmer (later team leader/project manager/system designer) for a company that provided an online bureau service providing access to billing and other accounting systems running on PDP 11/70s in our data centre. Basically the customers, smaller businesses, had a couple of dumb terminals (DEC VT100 etc.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100) ) and a dot matrix printer.  They connected via a single telco line and a data compressing multiplexer that allowed all the gear to share a 9600 baud line, usually configured the printer at 4800 and the VT100s at 9600.

These systems were character cell not GUI for the young-uns out there.  Invoices and reports would print on the dot matrix as needed.  This worked well if you were only producing a few hundred invoices a week.

Important: Each VT100 had a sticker with our company logo and support number on the back.

&amp;#x200B;

Later in the 80's customers  started transitioning to PC based accounting system, which we also sold.

One of our customers (call them existing good customer GC) transition from the online bureau system to a 2 PC networked system.  They sold off their old VT100s etc. at an auction.

So one day I'm happily working and our help desk transfer a strange call to me that they can't handle.  It is from the business owner of a company we have never had as a customer, call them BO.

&amp;#x200B;

The call goes as follows (more or less)

OP: Hello how can I help you?

BO: Hi, I am BO from company X and recently purchased one of your computers at an auction, I can't seem to get it to work.  Can you help?

OP: Ok, let's see what we can do, first what model computer is it?

BO: It is a Digital VT100, I know it was working at GC's office as have done business with them.\[We can see where this is going\]

OP: I explain that the VT100 is a dumb terminal, and that it needs to be connected to a computer to be useful, and how BC was connected to our online bureau.

BO: (Mystified) but it was working in GC's office?  Can't you make it work for me?I can see that it was working because their is faint writing on the screen (8+ years of burn in)

OP: Yes, but you need to sign up to use our online bureau, but today you are better off buying a PC based system as what you have is old technology.

BO: But I spent $700 on this computer!! Please help me!

OP: As I said, it is NOT a computer, just a dumb terminal that needs to be connected to a computer.

&amp;#x200B;

... more discussion ... eventually BO gets it, and feels a bit embarrassed, not to mention being out $700 for something worth about $50.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months later we did sell a PC solution to BO, so always be nice even when people do dumb things.

t3_c9u1mf,"""But why can't I have my manager's Password? This is important!""","Long time lurker, first time poster. Thought this one is worthy of being here.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: This happened around 4 years ago. I work for a large Bank at the IT Service Desk. We handle menial tasks like Password Resets, all the way through to provisioning of hardware, ""first line of defense"" for fraud and AML , among some other things. In a nutshell, every single call we get is carefully analysed and documented, on the chance something goes wrong and we need a trail of actions taken before hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of a long one. TL,DR is at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a Monday, we were flat out busy taking calls (over 600 a day between 10 of us) and I got the call from a rather annoying Personal Assistant, we'll call her $PA. $Manager is the manager she is said PA for (A very high up individual). I'm $Me.

&amp;#x200B;

**$Me** : Good morning IT this is $Me, can I confirm I am speaking to $PA?

**$PA**: I need help to reset the password for $Manager.

**$Me** : Okay, I need an email from $Manager confirming they are happy for this to occur.

**$PA** : Okay, hang on . . . (puts me on hold) . . . Okay it's sent.

( I notice that the email states : *From $PA on behalf of $Manager,* indicating $PA sent it from $Manager's mailbox in her email client, since she has access to that)

**$Me** : So I can see here you've sent this from your account, on behalf of $Manager. Unfortunately it has to come directly from him so we know that he has authorised it. Can he send us an email from his phone?

**$PA** : No, he can't. He's not here.

**$Me** : Then I can't reset his password, since he won't be aware of the change . . . (She cuts me off)

**$PA** : ""But why can't I have my manager's password? This is important!""

**$Me** : Unfortunately, I can't reset this password for you, without his knowledge. Also, another colleague using his account is a breach of our ""Use of Business Technology"" agreement . . . (Cut off again)

**$PA** : (Yells) I don't care, I need to get in and do this NOW! 

**$Me** : I'm sorry, I can't do this as $Manager is not present, nor are you allowed to use their account . . . (She hangs up on me whilst I'm talking)

  
I document the issue and let my Manager know. About 15 minutes pass by, and I've taken another 4 calls in that time. Our Head of Department (**$HOD**) comes storming up, more angry than I have ever seen her.

&amp;#x200B;

**$HOD** : $Me, explain to me, immediately, why you refused to reset $Manager's password!

**$Me** : (A little startled as $HOD is usually super nice) Hi $HOD, how did you know about that call?

&amp;#x200B;

**$HOD** : She called me and complained about it , saying you weren't doing your job and that you have now cost the company Millions of dollars in losses!

&amp;#x200B;

**$Me:** Okay . . . Well  I refused to reset the password as it was a breach of our Business Technology Usage agreement, which I believe you are aware of, and it didn't seem right to me to provide the details to $PA (don't quote me there, I don't remember the exact words). I also believe that $PA attempted to access $Manager's account without permission, which has caused issues in the past, which I don't really want to have to deal with again""

&amp;#x200B;

**$HOD** looks at me for a few seconds,smiles, and says: ""Completely understandable. Thank you for not providing that password. You've done a good job."" and promptly leaves. I shrug, and go about my day (these things happen, and I really didn't have the time to care about someone being upset at me).

&amp;#x200B;

Very shortly after, a Company wide email was sent reporting that ""due to individuals repeatedly abusing the ability to request a password reset for their Manager, the IT Service Desk will no longer be authorised to provide passwords to anybody except the individual in question, and only after correct Identification of the individual has been completed. No exceptions"". The email was from $HOD.

&amp;#x200B;

To this day $PA refuses to speak to me, which sucks for her since I seem to always answer when she calls. I just politely remind her when she calls that she is well aware that I can't do this. We now have had this happen more often (with the company getting bigger) and so all staff go through Mandatory Cyber Security training that enforces this. Anyone who attempts to bypass the procedure, complains about the procedure, or is thought to be attempting a breach of the ""Business Technology Usage"" agreement, is marked down in our Risk Register, and is subsequently investigated.  


**TL;DR :** PA gets irate that we won't provide her the password for her Manager's account. Attempts to get Head of Department involved. Backfires on her and gets Company wide policy updated. Staff can now lose their jobs if they attempt to bypass the policy.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c9w5ct,Nightmare from Tech Support Hell,"So this story is a little bit different from what I've been seeing on here. This has nothing to do with obnoxious users and everything to do with being put in a very bad and difficult situation. This was about 5 years ago or so when I was working at the Comm Focal Point, CFP, which is essentially the help desk function on any US Air Force base. So I was working with a couple of older civilians, the one for this story, let's call him Carter. Also NIPRNet is our non-secure network which is essentially regular internet with access to some internal military network functions, such as email, Air Force Portal, etc. Also I should mention that by this time we had eliminated all login with usernames and passwords and everyone was required to use their Common Access Card, CAC, which is a sort of smart card used for login. So story...

Carter: ""Is your NIPR working, mine won't let me in, it's telling me that my password is expired.""

Me: ""Yeah, I'm in and it's fine"" (Was thinking this was a little odd since people weren't required to use passwords anymore)

Carter: ""Can you check my account in Active Directory to see if there are any problems?""

Me: ""Yeah sure.""

Me: (Not thinking much of it) ""Hey this looks weird, it doesn't have the box checked for smart card required for interactive login, that's why it's telling you your password is expired""

I check the correct box and voila, he can get in

All of the sudden, ring ring ring

Another user: ""Hey my computer won't let me login, it says my password is expired""

Me: (I can hear more phone calls ringing but there are like three of us and we are all on the phone, I also have this sinking feeling) After checking his account ""Yes sir, for some reason it didn't have the box checked for you to use your smart card, It should be fixed now""

After three or four of these phone calls, I figure it's time to send a ticket up to our Network Operation Center, NOC, to figure out what is going on.

I take a short break from the phone calls to do some investigation while I""m writing up this ticket. I check my account. I check my friends accounts. I even checked our commander's account. All of them missing this box that needs to be checked so people can login.

We spend the next 2 hours or so fixing these boxes, first for people who were really important such as our Wing Commander, and then with just whoever was calling and complaining about it. Got no where near all of them but the NOC informed us that they had pushed a broken update to our Domain Controller, DC, and that they were about to fix it.

After they apply their fix, I take about 20 minutes or so, then I start checking user accounts. Sure enough, the box is being rechecked on everyone's accounts.

All of the sudden again, ring ring ring

Another user: ""My account says it's locked, can you check it""

Me: (Now this was a much more common problem so I was much less worried) ""Yes let me take a look, yeah it says you're locked so I just unlocked it, you should be good to go.""

Suddenly again we are flooded with calls and we start getting calls from the same people who we just helped saying their account is still locked. Sure enough, after checking, people that I had just unlocked were already locked again. Just like last time, I start to check my account, commander's account, friends accounts, all of them locked. Now the NOC had pushed a fix to the DC to check everyone's ""smart card required for interactive login"" box but it was locking out all user accounts across the domain. It also kept locking those accounts out even if we went in and unlocked them.

Because there were only three of us in the CFP, the commander ordered everyone in the communication squadron who had an administrative account to drop what they were doing and help us with trying to keep important accounts from being locked out.

After about 4 or 5 hours of constantly unlocking accounts, the NOC finally did push an update to the DCs so that they quit locking everyone out. That was miserable, and I've never been so tired in all my life as I was that night.

Final note, in case anyone wonders, the only reason we were able to unlock people's accounts and get anything done after the initial ""fix"" by the NOC is that our administrative accounts, at this time, did not require a smart card and could be accessed with user name and password. Since they weren't part of the ""Smart card required for interactive login"" problem, they weren't targeted by the script that broke everything. This would not work nowadays as a smart card is required for logging into a NIPR admin account. This would have caused a complete stoppage of all work on NIPRNet today.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c9tium,"""But my son is in IT!""","The company I work for is contracted with a number of agencies to provide support for mobile devices, including the 24/7 tier 1 call center. Most actual MDM/UEM support is provided by their own employees, but two of our clients require us to assist with the initial enrollment and escalate further issues to their tier 2 mdm team directly. 

These two clients are actually sister organizations and originally they were using the same mdm resources- both clients were in the same dep group, same servers, and same tier 2 support, but recently, one split and got their own dedicated system.  

Since they had only just recently migrated from UEM B to UEM A, (which we assisted with) now the one agency has to reenroll their devices again. A lot of calls ""didn't we just do all this? I did this last year?""

But those aren't the point of this story. 

When these changes are made, in order for the phone to actually reflect the changes you need to wipe the device and start again.   Users all had these guides, and you can tell they, for whatever reason, always skipped the second page that tell them to wipe the device

Users complain because they can't find the screen to put their log in information (only appears during setup from clean phone) 

Users figure since they already had their phone set up, they could just skip ahead to later parts.  Then they get frustrated when labels are different than the guide (because they're still on the system from their sister agency, there's a slight difference in applications and their names)

One in particular calls us up.  She had help from her ""Son in I.T."" but she kept getting emails she wasn't migrated, she wouldn't get her emails anymore. 

Well fine, maybe the reports and emails were pulled before she completed set up.   If she was successful, then she can ignore them.   I can't see the uem console, but I can use those label changes to diagnose it. 

Me: ""Okay,  do you see $ApplicationName on your home screen?""

Client: ""Do you mean $AppName?""

Me: ""No.  It seems like you'll need to wipe your phone and start over.""

Client: ""My son told me I didn't need to do that! He works in I.T!""

The lovely guide the agency wrote up for users went completely unused by her. We were told we're not here to hold their hands; they need to ask for specific help.  I ended up reading the enrollment guide aloud step by step.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c9p03g,"""Re-enable my account right now! I did nothing wrong!""","I am the manager of my college's IT helpdesk, but I started out as a student worker. I have plenty of stories from working here, enough that I joke with *my* manager a lot that one day I'm gonna write a book of them. But my favorite experience is by far before I was hired on as the full-time manager, still job shadowing the person who had my position previously.  
 

**Background:** My IT department has very strict cybersecurity regulations, seeing as cyber criminals enjoy targeting smaller, likely less protected schools, which contain a lot of sensitive information about students and staff. One of our rules for employees of the school is that anyone employed at the college (even student workers now, though not at the time of this story) **must** complete mandatory annual IT security training. This consists of the standard phishing recognition quizzes, social engineering cue reading, etc. We give employees the *entire semester* to complete this training and send bi-weekly notifications to their employee email addresses to let them know of the training deadline. The consequence of not completing the training? The user's account is marked as disabled until they reach out to us, provide us with an alternate email address to which we can send their customized training link, complete the training, and then notify us.

 

Now, after the deadline, our security admin (SA) sent out a spreadsheet to our team containing the names and email addresses of all the employees who failed to complete that training. The list was... remarkably long lol. Most people who called in were understanding, apologetic, and polite. But *one* employee was... yikes. We'll call her angry professor (AP).

 

**Me:** Thank you for calling your IT service desk, how can I help you?

**AP:** I need to get into my email. It's urgent.

**Me:** Alright, not a problem. Will you please let me know the error you are receiving when trying to access your account?

**AP:** It says you've disabled my account. I need to know why that is, and I need you to re-enable it right now.

**Me:** Pardon me just one moment, and I will investigate what might be causing this issue.

*(When I checked the list of employees who hadn't completed the IT training... yep, AP was on the list.)*

**Me:** Ah, I see what the issue is. Our records indicate that you had not completed the IT security training by the deadline, and the system automatically disabled your account--

**AP:** Excuse me, but uh. I'll have you know that I *did* complete that useless training you guys make me do every year. I have proof on my iPad. So, you had better re-enable my account immediately.

**Me:** I understand your frustration. If you will, please provide us with an alternative email address that I may provide our SA so that he may correspond with you to get this situation resolved right away.

**AP:** No, I won't do it! I don't see any need for that because I did nothing wrong and I have proof! I want you to fix my account right now!

**Me:** My apologies, but unfortunately, I am not authorized to re-enable accounts which have been disabled due to our security policies. However, I will be happy to email our SA on your behalf to get this resolved.

**AP:** You better get this fixed right now. I'll be expecting a call back ASAP.

**Me:** Understood, is there anything else I can help you w---

**AP:** *(hangs up)*

 

So, I emailed SA to let him know that AP was on the list of individuals who hadn't completed the training and refused to provide us with an alternate email. He eventually emailed back and let us know that, while she *had* completed the training, AP had completed it *two weeks late*. He told us that he had re-enabled her account and should be available to her ""whenever the system processes the change"". This gave me a very inaccurate time frame, and a very bad position. If I called AP back and told her that her account should be available in the next few minutes, she could check too soon and call back in a rage. But... if I told her a few hours, she would probably throw a fit that it couldn't be done immediately. So, I thought up a plan seeing as it was about 2 or 3 hours until the end of the day and gave her a call back.  
 

**Me:** Good afternoon, AP, you called us earlier regarding your disabled account? I am calling to inform you that your account has now been re-enabled, and you should have access to your email again *before the end of the day.*  
 

She was silent on the other end of the line for a solid 5-7 seconds. I thought the line had disconnected, but before I could confirm, she spoke up. Keep in mind, at this point, I'm still a *student worker.* And this is a professor speaking to me like this. 

 

**AP:** End of the day??? Make it go faster!! Don't you know I can't do my job without my email, you idiot!

**Me:** I believe there may be some miscommunication, ma'am. The system is currently processing the request to re-enable your account. This may take some time. I understand your frustration, but---

**AP:** Well you better just call the vendor of that system and tell them to make it go faster! I need my account NOW!

**Me:** I understand; however, I do not have the ability nor the authority to follow through on that request. Thank you for being patient and understanding.

**AP:** Well. I'll have you know. Once your system lets me back into my account, I'll be writing a very strongly worded letter to Mr. IT Department Director about what a terrible employee you are that you can't do your job.

**Me:** Thank you for your feedback. Is there anything else I can help you---?

**AP:** *(hangs up again)*  
 

Yikes. I was sweating, but the jaded guy who had the helpdesk managerial position was laughing since it was his last week: ""same sh\*t, different day"". Now, I was thinking that was the end of that; she'd get her account back, send an email to the director, and the director would laugh at her and tell her exactly what I told her but less kindly. But no. She calls back later, a smug tone in her voice.  
 

**Me:** Thank you for calling your IT service desk, how can I help you?

**AP:** Guess who has access to her account now. \~

**Me:** I'm very happy to hear that. Please let us know if we can--

**AP:** I just wanted to let you know before you misinform anyone else that they won't have access to their account until *after the end of the day.*

**Me:** Understood, thank you for your feedback on our customer service. We're always looking to improve the experience our users have. Is there anything else I can help you with? :)

**AP:** *(hangs up)*

 

I couldn't help but laugh when she hung up that she twisted my words from earlier. Later that week, I asked my department director if she ever emailed him, and he told me no. However, he also explained that based on her actions, *he let her immediate supervisor know of her behavior.* And if anyone, especially an employee of our college, ever acts such a way to me or anyone working with me again, to let him know immediately so that he may act.

 

Ever since then, every time AP calls the helpdesk, she is as sweet as honey. :)",talesfromtechsupport

t3_c9odsb,Customer Problem Repair Breaks Customer,"First-time poster here. Fair warning, it's kinda long.

Yes, I read the sidebar.

So this one took place back in the early Naughties, and while I was working for an IT outsource company for a MAJOR DSL provider, we'll call them CDSL. We didn't usually have direct access to the larger company as a whole, but if the problem was big enough, we could sometimes get the numbers we had to call to get someone that ***could*** fix an intractable problem.

I had been working there for about six months when I get my promotion to Tier III tech support (which means ***I*** get the calls that the floor techs couldn't sort out, or worse the dreaded ""I wanna talk to your manager!"" from an EC (this was an ***incredibly*** regular occurrence.) After a couple of months, and I'm settled into the daily grind.

&amp;#x200B;

The cast:

LC: Me, in my Tier III role

TL: My team lead

T2: A Tier II tech.

MT: ""Technician"" at the MCO

COT: Another Technician elsewhere

PC: The Poor Customer.

SD: Salesdroid

MPC: Mrs. PC

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is not your standard EC, as he \*had\* gotten screwed here. He had been calling for ***months*** wanting his DSL provisioned. The only thing he'd seen thus far was his modem and the bills. It's not the first time he'd come across my part of the Helldesk, but according to the notes on his ticket, this particular conversation is the fifty-first time he'd escalated the call to my level, split across all three NA call centers (the other two were different companies, unassociated with mine). Looking through the history on this thing, I can see total dumpster fire alight from ***thousands*** of light-years away. The conversation goes something like this.

LC ""CDSL Tech Support, this is LC. What can I help you with?""

PC ""I want T2's manager. NOW."" He's angry, and rightfully so. It was T2's first day out of training, and she had gotten me in tears.

LC ""I'm T2's manager. Can I help you?""

PC ""You need to fire that woman. She was even more useless than your regular crap people.""

LC ""It's her first day, so I think I'll keep her around and try and make a decent tech out of her. Will that be all right.""

PC ""Fine, what the fuck ever. You need to fix my shit. NOW.""

Now, I do NOT have the tools I need to perform a proper diagnosis on his phone line, but I know who does. However, the queue for the MCO has been stupidly long all day, and with this guy's history I need to choose my next words VERY carefully.

LC ""I'll see what I can do, sir. You don't happen to have the name of the SD you talked to originally?""

Just so happens he does, so I add it to my notes on the ticket and a piece of paper I keep handy just for situations like this.  He'll get HIS later. In some other post elsewhere.

LC: ""I need to talk to someone for a minute or six, PC. It may take a little while, so please be patient.""

PC: ""Just get it done before I sue everyone I've ever talked to at CDSL.""

I put him on hold, and before I call MT, I motion TL over and let him know that PC is talking about lawsuits.

TL: (who is well aware of this guy) ""He does that every once in awhile. Put it in your notes and call the MCO."" I do as instructed and make the call.

Miracle of all miracles, I get through \*immediately.\* In the entire time I've been at this company, this has NEVER happened. ""CDSL, MT speaking.""

LC: ""Huh? Seriously?""

MT: ""Yes, seriously. Can I get a ticket number?""

LC: \*reads number\*

MT: ""Oh, that guy. We keep telling him he's too far away, and he refuses to listen.""

LC: ""Can we check it again anyway? Just so I can give him the correct information and ship him to retention properly?""

MT: ""I don't want to, but if it'll get you two to go away, fine."" He runs the test and gives me a number. PC isn't too far away, but it's a near thing. We can provision farther out than the limit we tell the customers, but the coverage can be kinda spotty. PC is within the normal limit with a smallish margin for error of a thousand feet or so of copper wire from his local central office.

I add MT's name to my list. There is NO reason PC has had to call in for MONTHS (while footing the bill), and I'm going to figure out exactly what's going on. My shift has been over for awhile by this time, and I'm ***very*** late for class (at the local Community College). I demand (and get) the number for the next level of techs, and summon TL once again.

TL: ""Still threatening to sue?""

LC: ""Haven't gotten back to him yet. Mind if I take a chunk of tomorrow to fix this guy's problem?""

TL: ""Take all day, if it'll get him off our backs. He's costing us a fortune. I'll clear it with my boss and get someone to cover for you.""

LC: ""Out-fucking-standing. I'll be on it as soon as I'm logged in.""

I let PC know that his problem will be fixed if at all possible, and that I'd be on it first thing in the morning as my shift was over.""

PC: ""You can get this fixed?""

LC: ""About 90% sure of it, sir. I'm on the case until it gets fixed or I can give you a clear reason why. Just give me a few days, and I'll call you the minute I have something to report.""

PC: ""You'd better.""

LC: ""I like keeping my promises, sir. Thank you for calling CDSL Tech Support, and have a nice day.""

He hangs up, and I fly to class, only to arrive at dismissal time. Dratted traffic.

The following morning, I get into work, and I'm given a new number to log in with. I do that, and get to digging. I'm still there according to the clock, but not in the Tier III queue. So I have a phone I can dial out of, the internet, and a whole day in front of me to deal with every layer of CDSL I can get my grubby mitts on.

First stop, Sales. By nothing more than raw luck, I get SD. I give him PC's number, and he states that the provisioning was done months ago. I thank him, hang up, and move along the line. Next to the MCO, and I wait for nearly an hour to talk to MT. We essentially repeat the previous day's conversation, only this time I manage to get a bit more information about the condition of the modem.

I order the customer a new modem as a precaution, and move along to the CO after a very short break. Another hour, and somone finally picks up. I talk to that guy for awhile, and he gives me a number for another, closer CO. Like, half the distance closer.

Four hours later, and I've gotten the problem fixed. His number was moved to the new CO, and I speak to the tech that actually did the work, including a replacement duplex card in the server. His modem needs a restart, and all should be well.

At this point, I'm stuck, as I'm at the end of my shift, I finish my notes and get prepared to give him a call first thing in the morning.

The following morning, I check everything with the MCO, and give him a jingle with the great news. He picks up the phone.

LC: ""Hi! This is LC with CDSL Tech Support-""

PC: ""You rat-fucked son of a BITCH!""

Over the next several minutes he calls me every name in the book, including a few I'd only ever heard out of grizzled Master Chiefs and Gunnery Sergeants (Former USN). Everything BUT a white dude (which would have been true). I slapped my headset off and let it hang there until he stopped talking. I put my headset back on.

LC: ""Sir?""

Silence.

LC: ""Sir?""

Silence again.

LC: ""PC?""

MPC: (completely calm) ""I'm sorry, can you call back? I need the line to make another call.""

LC: ""Of course, Ma'am. Just let your husband know that he needs to restart his modem, and everything should be good to go.""

MPC hngs up, and a feeling of dread falls over me. I think about it, and wonder if he's okay. The entire team is looking at me, stunned.

TL: ""Why didn't you hang up on him?""

LC: ""Didn't want to make it worse, TL. Besides, I couldn't have warned him about the language, as I couldn't see how to get a word in edgewise. Better for him to let it all out. I think.""

TL: ""You think?""

LC: ""His wife picked up after he stopped and asked for the line so she could make another call.""

TL sends me home for the day, with pay, and come in for my shift on Monday morning. I spend the entire weekend worried about PC.

First thing Monday morning (nearly a week after I started on the case), I call back over there, expecting to get yelled at again. MPC answers, and I ask how things are going.

MPC: ""I'm sorry, but I'm on my way to PC's funeral.""

LC: ""Huh?""

MPC: ""He got a little heated when he talked to you last, and had a massive heart attack. According to the doctor, he was dead before he hit the floor.""

LC: ""I'm so sorry, MPC.""

MPC: ""Don't be. It wasn't your fault. He was a dick anyway.""

I went outside, grabbed a smoke (my first in months), and told some of my Tier II co-workers (which included T2) about what had happened.

t3_c9a8tb,"Okay, but I can't find outlook!!","I work for an MSP as a network architect. From time to time when summer vacations role around, I end up covering helpdesk for the odd call or two.


Anyway, today I got a ticket placed in my queue for a password reset. I was going to re-assign it, but it was close to the end of the day, and I figured it was a nice easy way to begin winding down.

We will call this person Brian because that's his name. Brian's password expired and needed it reset. Rather than resetting it, I figured I'd show him how to change it on a terminal server when he gets the email it was about to expire. Mistake number 1.


As I was working with him, he had this weird obsession with Outlook. It was so bizzare. 

Anyway, instructed Brian to go to our webpage and download our remote software. This was a twenty minute affair.  Brian was extremely concerned about where Outlook was. Eventually, we got there. The conversation after the file was done downloading went something like this:

Me:""Okay, now run it""

Brian: ""okay, but outlook closed, one second"".


The call took over an hour, mostly because Brian ""is not good with computers, lol""
 (understatement of the century).

After remoting in, I finally found out the reason for Brian's obsession. To browse to a website, Brian composes a new message in Outlook and types in the website (http prefix and all), and then sends it to himself. Then, he clicks on the link he sent to himself.  This is how Brian browses the internet. 


To Brian, there is nothing wrong with this. That is what email is for, right? I should also mention that Brian is an accountant. He should know what a browser is, as their accounting software is web-based.


It was at this point I decided I'm too old for this, packed up my shit, and left an hour early.

t3_c9536r,User Reads Manual Before Calling Support,"I swear this actually happened!

We're in the middle of a new laptop rollout at work, and one user got her new laptop this morning. A few minutes ago she called asking for help setting up her SoftPhone (Shoretel).

Her actual question was ""what's the server name we're supposed to use?"". Ok, not atypical so far... I tell her the name, but she says it's still not working for her. In that event the problem is usually the password... The phone system is not integrated into our directory, has higher complexity requirement than we're using in the rest of the organization, and the software allows users to save their password. The end result of is that no one knows their password.

So I go ahead and reset her password, and remote in to help her through the configuration. When I get in, I see that the server name was put in as name. domain. tld (note the spaces). I take out the spaces, enter her temporary password, and get her logged in (complete with password reset on first login).

Here's where it gets crazy... Once I finish I notice that Acrobat is open in the background. The document: How to Configure Shoretel Client.

The user actually went out looking for documentation from our document management systems (which most of our users are allergic to - one actually complained to the Joint Health and Safety Committee that having to use it represented a psycho-socio workplace hazard.), found it, opened it, and read it before calling for support.

Let's just say that in the past 10 minutes I've gone around to everyone in my team and told then about this and they don't believe it either.

t3_c94xv3,"Power Outage? Wifi still on? Beeping noise coming from 3rd floor closet? Probably fine, right?","When I was in high school (6+ years ago) I was the unofficial tech support for my small private high school. Printer not working? I'd get pulled out of class. VHS player not working? Called in from recess. And so on.

One day, I'm in art class on the 3rd floor of my 3-story school building when the power goes out. Right away, everyone checks their phones and sees that the wireless is still on. Strange. Then someone pulls up the local power company's outage map. Four parts of the county are without power, all in expensive neighborhoods/ areas. So the three classes on the 3rd floor meet in the middle and are texting, calling, googling away. Rumors that its a terrorist attack (I live in an area with lots of government employees) start to circulate. 

10 minutes have passed at this point. I'm on my phone when I hear a beeping noise coming from a utility closet. So I walk over and open the door to find a mess of cables and a lot of flashing lights (current me would be furious on how haphazard the setup was). I manage to figure out that a router is in here and it is hooked up to a UPS. This takes me about five minutes. Meanwhile, both students and staff have passed by me, in the closet that absolutely should have been locked, and continue to ignore me.

After a few more minutes, the beeping stops and the wifi is still on, so I call it quits, not wanting to mess with it anymore. I leave the closet and sit back down. 

Even though multiple teachers and staff saw me in there, I was never spoken to about it or admonished/punished in any way.

And it wasn't a terrorist attack, obviously. Just a random power outage.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c8vqqb,That One Time I Screwed Up A Job Interview And Got The Job.,"This is a different kind TFTS from me to all of you. This is the moral support that we don't see posted here too often. 

Right. So here's the deal. I've been a contractor for the DoD for 10+ years. I have bounced between so many different contracting companies, supported all four branches of the military at some point or another, and have worked on some incredible projects and programs during those years. I've had hard times here and there and I've had my fair share of good times. Throughout all of this, I'd tried repeatedly to become a federal employee.

The reason for all of those attempts is due to the fact that I wasn't able to join the military due to my hearing impairment. Turns out that Uncle Sam doesn't like it when you try to join already deaf; he wants that joy all to himself. 

Well, this past January I'd put in an application for a position at my local Air Force base. As far as government job postings go, this was a rather mundane description. The gist of it was pretty much just maintain the file permissions of the various users and groups. Eh, simple enough. I just figured they'd be using Active Directory, something I've got a fair amount of experience with.

Fast forward to February, and I get an email alerting me that I've been referred for the position. For those that are not aware, government actions on anything, even on hiring personnel to fill a role, takes forever. So, February I was referred to the role, and March is when I get scheduled for the interview.

The way an interview process for a government position works is way different than you expect in the private sector. You show up, they give you a sheet of paper that lists the questions they want to ask you, and give you 5-15 minutes to write down your answers. Then, they'll collect you and guide you to a conference room where you'll be interviewed by 3 or so people, asking you the questions that you've already answered on your sheet of paper. It's this process where things almost went completely south, sideways, pear-shaped, or any other colorful euphemism (personally, I prefer Charlie-Foxtrot). 

They take me to a room to fill out my questionnaire. All told, there were five questions they wanted me to answer. The first four dealt with applications that I had never heard of; I didn't even have a clue as to their proper function because the questions related to those applications were so vague! The fifth question asked me about what certifications I had, for those who were curious.

I sat there for about five or so minutes, going over each and every question. I had no idea how to answer them. Finally, I decided to write across the top of the paper, ""After reviewing the questions provided, I feel I may not be a good fit for this position. Thank you for your time and consideration."" I poked my head out of the room I was in, and I didn't see anyone around, so I just left the building. I got in my truck, and started the drive back home. I felt dejected. I was honestly hopeful that this would have been my one solid chance to end my contractor career and become a government employee. 

When I was about 3 minutes from my home, my mobile rang. I answered the call, and it was the supervisor of the area I had put in for. In short order, he told me that this is my one chance to sell myself, that if I really want the position, they'll hold the interview spot open for me and give me a chance. I flipped a U-turn so fast and sped all the way back to the base and got to the building real quick! Upon entry to the building, I was greeted in the foyer by the supervisor who expressed his joy in seeing me return. We make our way to the conference room, where I meet the two others who are to interview me. Since I didn't fill out my questionnaire, they ask me to just go over my experience and what I've done over the years. They explain a bit about the program that they are looking to fill the position for. Without going in to too much information, it's a project that utilizes the skills I've picked up working on ODXC's and MSPP's with my soon-to-be former role. 

I relay that I've done everything from working as a tier 1 technician on help desk for the Air Force to a network engineer for the Army. I'd been to bases all across the country and a few outside of the country. I had spearheaded some big projects on previous contracts, and seen them come to fruition, on time and under budget. I state that all the certifications I've earned I earned on my own time, without attending any formal classes or seminars. Pretty much, I sold myself as best as I could, probably better than I ever have in all of the interviews I've ever had.

I finish and answer a couple of probing questions (things along what I like to do in my downtime, and the like). They'd let it be known that out of all the candidates that they'd interviewed so far, I was the only one that had any experience with transport layer technology. After that, they thank me for my time and I went on my way. 

The rest of the month of April passes, and then May starts on strong. The first two weeks of May, I hadn't heard anything one way or the other about the position. And then, midway through the month, I get an email offering the position to me. 

I was gobsmacked. I'd literally walked away from the interview after writing on their questionnaire that I didn't think I'd be good fit. I'd hoped, but wasn't certain, that I'd sold myself in a spectacular fashion when I did go back. But, there it was! Sure as I am an idiot at times, as an email saying that the position was mine! If I recall correctly, I think my wife was cheering loudly for a bit, I can't recall because I was so stunned.

I'm finishing out my last week right now. I find it ironic that my last day is on the 4^(th) of July. I'll be riding home at night on my motorcycle with fireworks going off all above me.

&amp;#x200B;

The TL;DR of this post is this: Don't sell yourself short, especially as a tech. Take that chance to move up to something new. More importantly, make sure you have something to bring to the table, so tackle a new skill-set or pick up a new cert. Y'all are badasses in my eyes. Also, sorry if this doesn't fit 100% in the TFTS community. I've followed many of you through your postings and I've had a few of you follow me on some of mine. I felt that if anyone would appreciate this post, it'd be this community.

t3_c8xp3v,There are just some things that can't be done over the phone,"So I got like a ton of these but I think my first post here, which is also my favorite tech support story of all time, will be one that a friend of mine told me. I used to be in the Air Force, and the helpdesk function, if you can call it that, fell to the Comm Focal Point, or CFP. While working at a CFP at my last duty station before I got out, I was working with a young lady, a SSgt, who had previously worked at a shall we say very high profile military installation. While working there she got to deal with a lot of generals, civilians, and contractors, all way up the food chain. She gets a call one day with a guy freaking out on the other end. First, to explain what this thing is, an UPS is an uniterruptible power source and is, at least in this case, essentially a surge protector with a battery on it. It's really only meant to keep a computer running short term if there is a loss or fluctuation of power in the building. So he calls her freaking out ""my UPS is on fire."" My friend, probably confused, ""Did you call the fire department?"" Him, ""no can't you put it out from there?"" My friend, ""no you need to call the fire department."" I should also probably mention at this point that some of these UPS have an ethernet port so that you can manage them remotely but, you know, obviously putting out a fire isn't something that someone can command the UPS to do from another location. There is no ""stop burning"" button if you log into it. I guess the guy finally pulled out the fire extinguisher and took care of it himself, but that one still gets me that he wanted her to remote in and stop his UPS from burning.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c8upy7,The quest to find the Admin with the Power of Reboot!,"Gather close my friends for the tale I tell is one fraught with danger, intrigue, and suspense. We join our plucky SAN admin as she embarks on an epic quest to find the Admin with the power of reboot!

It all started last week. The day dawned sunny and bright, full of promise, as our plucky adventures, Peach, brought her laptop online and took a good swig of the elixir of life known as Irish Black Tea (can't drink coffee, have to get the go juice from somewhere). It was looking to shape up to a good day. Tickets were down, uptime was stable, and she just might be able to work on those pesky complice requirements, but it was not to be, for sitting in her inbox was an email from her client boss, letting her know that the weekly reports were due and not in his inbox.

She put on her diag cap, took another fortifying drink, and prepared to dive into the long and painful log in process to see what was going on. ""It should not take 15 min and 3 vpns to log in!"", She cried as another small piece of her soul died. She hoped it would be a quick reboot and back to Reddit, but she was not that lucky. The reporting web page attached to the app wouldn't load, and trying to RDP into the server timed out. She did what any user would do, opened a ticket in AsNow to, what she hoped was the correct Intel team, to have the server metaphorically whacked upside the bytes. She emailed client boss with the ticket number and hoped that was enough to appease the beast, and moved on to more important things, r/aww for instance. 

Every day the client boss would ask how it was going, and she dutifully answered the ticket was in queue and waiting. She did not have much hope of the ticket being processed anytime soon. The Intel team had around 10,000 tickets in queue. They'll get to it next month or so. The client boss was patient for a while, but, today, after 5 days without his precious repots, he had enough. He engaged the big guns, called the account team and put the fear in them. ""Fix the reports today!"", he cried.

Hounds were loosed, sabers were rattled and horses stamped. We were hunting admins. The client boss had spoken and no one was going home until the reports appeared! Now, some of you might ask why she didn't push the issue in the first place and follow up with the Intel team to get it resolved. You see, Peach was new to the account. The people, that's right, people, she replaced left very few clues and no maps for her to follow in navigating the 7th circle of BigBlue server support, and the Intel team was on another continent 11 hours ahead. They didn't have names attached to their ticket queue and only a shared email address could be found. Without the Big Guns, there was no movement to be had. The ticket was lost in a mountain of red tape and paperwork.

The Big Guns sallied forth, storming the bastion of the Intel team, demanding answers as to why the ticket has no movement. ""Don't hurt us!"" they cried! ""It is not our server, and the ticket is in the wrong system. It must be opened in BMaximo to another continent 7 hours ahead. ""Onward!"", Peach cried. The first ticket closed, the second one opened and the Big Guns cried for blood. ""The ticket must be escalated! Client boss must be appeased! 

The next Intel team did answer, ""It's not our ticket, it's not our OS. The ticket belongs to the Linux group!"" At this Peach was frustrated. Her other reporting server was on a Windows VM, why was this one Linux?? The lack of documentation was vexing! That did explain why RDP timed out as Linux resists the siren call of a GUI.

Off to the Linux team they went, banners held high. ""We will prevail! The client boss has spoken!"" The Linux team met them with great force. ""We do not manage that server! It is managed by the Storage team. We say good day sir!"", they cried as they pushed the ticket back. The Big Guns answered, ""The Storage team manages the application good sirs, not the OS"" but to no avail. The Linux team had defeated the Big Guns and had logged off, even escalations and nashig  of teeth would not bring them back. All looked dark, but Peach had an idea! Wasn't there a VMWare team, perhaps they had the magic of the reboot! 

Off they rode to the VMWare team, arriving work torn and weary. A kindly gentleman met them as they prepared to knock. ""What do you seek?"" Peach gathered her energy for one last plea. ""We have traveled far and wide, searching high and low, through two ticket queues and 4 admin groups looking for the on with the power of reboot. Please, good Sir, can you help?"" The good man logged in to vCenter, of which Peach was jealous. She wanted the power of vCenter! He said, ""I do not manage the appliance, the storage team does."" ""But good Sir, I am the storage team, and I do not have the power of root or reboot to give cleint boss his reports. Can you please help?"" The good Sir, seeing her distress, said, ""I have the power of reboot, though I don't manage this server, I will assist."" He then used his power and Saints be praised, the reboot brought the application up, and client boss received his reports and all was well in the kingdom once again!

TL/DR Reports missing. Software unresponsive. Two ticketing systems, 4 different teams and 3 escalations later finally got someone to help me reboot a Linux server. Technically I support the appliance, but I don't have root access to the OS, and I don't have access to vCenter to manage the VM which means I'm out of luck if it locks up. Gotta love big business and silos.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_c8pl72,"""Our MedCarts Don't Work and we can't understand why!"" Thank God Vaca starts today!"," 

One of my medical facilities called in an issue with one of their MedCarts last week.

The issue as they described it, is that it would not turn on.

The Helpdesk receives this exact call quite frequently. Our MedCarts consist of a large cart with mounted monitor, there is a micro computer mounted behind a locked compartment on the back of the cart. The Cart has its own system board which all components interface to and which controls all of the locked med drawers.

The Medcarts also have a battery mounted underneath which keeps them powered when not plugged in and on the move down the hall.

Typical troubleshooting was done, is the cart receiving power? Is the power switch in the on position? Is the computer itself actually turned on?

HelpDesk is told that it is not receiving power even when plugged in and switch on, which usually indicates an issue with the battery itself needing replacement (poor design).

We requested to have Plant Operations for the facility swap the battery.

Today we get another call from the facility that the battery was replaced and still nothing, and now none of the 4 medcarts are receiving power!

Weird?! How is this possible. Through some coaxing of the receptionist we learned that ""Plant Operations changed the batteries out, after they power-washed all the carts this past week.""

All I cant say is, WOW! You guys thought it was a smart idea to powerwash a device with a bunch of electrical components built in?

Silence......

t3_c8mord,I didn't do anything to the site!,"I work from home most of the time.  Today my colleague sent me a text message about one of the client sites I've been working on.

&gt;C: Not since last week.

The first thing I do is check whether that client's other sites are still up, since they're all on the same cpanel account.  The other sites are fine, thankfully.  Time to check the DNS.  The DNS records in cpanel all look fine, but upon checking our list of domains from the seller, I discover that something has changed.  Specifically that [site]'s domain name, instead of being pointed at our host's nameservers, has a single TXT record with a Smoogle site verification code in it.

I text my colleague again.

&gt;Me: Found the problem, someone was messing with the DNS settings for the domain name.

t3_c8ogxe,Never trust the user (nor the devs),"I work for a pretty large tech company in my country. We're basically doing anything from dev to ops to test.
I'm in the IT-Security department and we are constantly argueing with the customers about the impact, rating (and other related stuff) of vulnerabilities. 

However, we had a retest of an web application with several High and Critical vulns. (XSS, SQLI, reverse shells... you get the point) 

Customer is the teamlead of a small dev team (5-10 peoples) and had already management attention.

Customer: ""We fixed any critical and high finding""
Me: "" Alright, the test starts tomorrow. We will be finished at about the end of the week.""

[... to the end of the week and the debriefing and presentation of the test report..]

Me: ""Well, there are still a lot of vulnerabilities open in your application. I suggest to fix all of them, before going live.""

Customer: "" But we are already live""

Me (stunned for a few seconds): ""But what's with all these high rated vulns?""

Customer: ""How did you find them?""

Me: "" It's all in the old report, most of them were not fixed.""

Customer: ""You shouldn't even be able to acces the web app.""

Me (again stunned): "" huh? Why? You said, you're already live. Everything worked fine."" 

Customer: "" No we blocked your departments IP from the last test. You cheated the report and never did a retest.""

Me (now nearly laughting): ""wait a minute"" [opens web browser, shares the screen, throwing the reverse shell]
Customer hangs up the call..


To clarify this: we have several networks and IPs for testing, depending on our department, preferences and the load on each network... they thought they could trick penetration testers by blocking one specific IP.


A few management calls later, the application is no longer avaiable. I really lost a bit my of my faith in humanity at this point.

t3_c8o38h,How much milk do you need? Long,"I’m not sure if tech support stories where you make it to the end without questioning  humanity are allowed. But if they are I do have a few stories.

If not then I’m sorry and I’ll delete this.
Anyway this is roughly a few years ago so my memory isn’t as great as it was. So a lot of it is paraphrased and names and such are changed for privacy.  Also I’m on mobile. 


My neighbour was in her mid 60’s and had decided to finally accept her late husband was right to get a IPad and join the wonderful world that is the online world. 

He started out with a basic laptop from a family member and gotten wifi and a printer. Me being somewhat tech savvy I became the unofficial tech support. And would be over there most nights walking him through what a cookie was and how to shop online. 

His wife wanted nothing to do with computers and didn’t like the Internet (she was convinced terrorists would steal her bank details if she shopped online) but age and failing health force her to accept getting the shopping brought to the door was easier. 

After his passing she was stuck on her own with a laptop and a ipad and no clue which way was the right way to hold it. So I began teaching her and went over one day to check if she was alright as she just lost her husband and was on her 5th heart attack.


She asked me to check the shopping app as she was having trouble with it. I sat down and went over everything and checked the basket. She had 12,4 pints of milk in the basket.

Me: “Um quick question I’m looking at the shopping list and your basket and I don’t see a number 12 next to the milk”

Neighbour: “I don’t want 12 milk”

Me: “Then why did you add 12 to your basket”

Neighbour: “It wouldn’t add it so I kept clicking it”

Me: “Right, I taken them out and you got 2 which was the original number, would it be easier if I did the shopping?”

Neighbour: “Yes”

Me: “Right then”

She went off to make me a cup of tea, after a few minutes I called her back.

Me: “Why is a large part of the list chocolate and cakes where you are diabetic?”

Neighbour: “oh I like cakes”

Me: “but won’t they make you ill?”

Neighbour: “I don’t eat them all at once”

Me trying not to laugh: “good answer” 


After that we had  a system where either me or her sister would help with the shopping as this wasn’t the first time she went crazy with the ordering.

t3_c8mguu,Boss: They cannot log in! Me: Gee I wonder why..,"Hello TFTS! I've started my first IT job this year (CS-student) at a small firm and have been acquiring some good stories from down the road. This one stars our ex-CEO let's call him $Boss.

&amp;#x200B;

We've been digitizing educational books (med student books mainly) as e-books which can be read online. I recently finished creating 3 sites for accessing different e-books and they were ready to be sent to the customer. Usually we buy a separate domain for the sites, but one of these -- let's call it X -- was taken and we did not want to pay $2k for it (we're a very small company) so the workaround was that I created subdomain\_for\_x.mainsite.com instead of the usual www.domain\_for\_site.com. (We will be revamping the whole thing to be under 1 common domain in the end, thus the workaround)

&amp;#x200B;

Now the $Boss tells me I've gotta add some university IP ranges to access the e-books. Alright, I add the appropriate IP ranges and send the links to all 3 sites for $Boss to forward them to the university so they can test everything works correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

Couple of days go by and $Boss tells me the university cannot login to site X at all, but the other two are working fine. The direct quote was that ""We cannot login to site X"". I start to think I botched the IP ranges somehow so I check that they're all correct. I ask $Boss if they're using subdomain\_for\_x.main\_site.com address for the problematic site and he confirms that. I go check the IP filtering code (written by my predecessor) but can't find any faulty logic there. At this point I ask for the customer's IP to see if they're trying to access it outside the university ranges, but the IP is in fact within the range.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm baffled. The site is working 100% correctly for me, I've tried using various testing accounts with various permission settings and also tested and confirmed IP filtering to work with my IP so there should be nothing broken. Then $Boss tells me he can send the email convo to me if that helps. I receive the emails and immediately I see it.

&amp;#x200B;

$Boss is not the most technical person (we're not an IT-firm) and in his eyes internet addresses are always of form [www.site.com](https://www.site.com) whereas I think that's really a thing of the past, especially with subdomains. So after I sent the address for site X ([subdomain.mainsite.com](https://subdomain.mainsite.com)) he decided the add the www prefix to it before sending it to the customer. I had not generated a (sub)domain for [www.subdomain.mainsite.com](https://www.subdomain.mainsite.com) so the address never resolved. I had asked 3 times if $Boss was using the correct address (without www) but he saw them as the same address and said yes each time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now this would've also been easier to troubleshoot had $Boss not said to me ""They cannot LOGIN to the site"", even though the customer included a screenshot in the email convo where it clearly said ""Site cannot be reached"" with an offline icon (the chrome page for urls that don't resolve). I had to brew a strong coffee after that. And register www redirects for all subdomains as well.. You win this time www.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_c8g40k,"Old Job, New Job, Same Job","I spent the first four years of my adulthood working behavioral therapy as a nursing assistant. Mostly worked in retirement communities and nursing homes that had lock-down dementia units built-in. Thing about some of these nursing homes, the law allowed them to claim to be 'long-term partial-independence patients' and their insurance to be billed differently by the insurance companies. This allowed them to stay at a long-term home indefinitely under protective care, and the family was only billed partially if their insurance was good. A lot of these ""Send 'em and Forget 'em"" patients were these people's own parents and family, and they were lucky to get family contact ever again.  Sometimes, however, there'd be the rare case where the family was always there. They actually never left their side and they actively participated in their loved ones' care. These were the rare families.

Fast forward four or five years, and I'm starting my new career in IT Retail. I work in a used goods electronic store as a salesperson. Now, to be totally honest, the majority of our stock in the back sort of comes through in rotations. There's a fairly constant stream of donated junk that mostly gets recycled. We get a lot of it, and sometimes it's really really cool to see what kind of things people just give away. Old or rare things, or stuff that's still in good condition... even some of the really really janky things that end up in our crates, it's a cool job sometimes. Whatever is still useable is plugged in to see if it works, memory is wiped, and if we find anything that still has accessories or parts attached to it we'll rubber band them together and slap a price tag on it. These were the rare finds.

We sort through stuff in crates, and when one crate or box gets too full to keep in the back, we'll go through it to do some finer testing to make sure it's useable. Some things we just get so many of, we don't really test them because it would take way too much time. Tablets and computers are one exception. The computers either get scrapped for parts in the little boxes near the tech bench, their empty casing lining the shelf behind them, or they get a checkup and reinstall and get put out near-immediately. The tablets, not really being upgradeable or repairable, either get completely recycled or sold. Testing is a pretty quick thing, usually. Plug it in, turn it on, factory reset it, and update it again if you can. If it's actual junk, then chuck it. We get \*a lot\* of old tablets, most of them too old to really be useable for anything but the barest basics. Sometimes, however, people surprise you and we get some very, very nice things.

I'm sitting out on the sales floor helping people, answering questions, doin' the retail worker thing. This thin lady and this tall man come up to my counter and ask to look at the tablets. I pull open the case for probably the fifth time that day; everyone's been wanting to look at them. Most of them are kinda \*actual\* junk. Old Nooks, some extremely outdated Kindles, some knock-off Acers. Useable, if you don't mind the quirks of an obsolete OS and the low-speed. But, we had a couple of rather nice Galaxy Tabs that hadn't been completely outpaced yet. They seemed rather interested in the device. I explained our return policy, but the problem is our store is a rare one. They could only return it to this specific store, and a lot of people come from very far out of town to visit it, often a trip that would make it hard for them to return it. So, naturally, people like to test out their stuff before they buy it to see if it works. Generally, if I've tested an item for customers multiple times, I'll tell them everything I know about it specifically. What's broken, how far it can update, whether or not it can make phone calls, etc. etc.

This was an older Tab 2, I think. Outdated, not going to be supported for a lot longer, etc etc. We got to talking, and the gentleman mentioned it was for his wife's mother, who lived in their trailer with them and their small baby. She had recently developed Alzheimer's, and was always asking them questions about what the time of day was, where they were, she was seeking reassurance from them constantly, and they were wearing out quickly. They wanted something to keep her occupied so they could get some peace. But, they were broke and had a baby to feed, so they couldn't send her to a nursing home and were caring for her on their own.

I ended up helping them find everything they needed that day on sale, even the case and keyboard. I also helped them find an adult daycare center where she could spend her time with other seniors. I also got them in touch with a caregiver support group, and pointed them to a few websites like A Place for Mom and ALZ.org. Even ended up giving them a hug.

I didn't expect to be helping someone with knowledge from my old job rather than my new job. It was, well... it was nice. I hope they're doing okay.

TL;DR -- I was a psych ward nurse aide, and am now working at a secondhand electronics store. Couple needed some help with advice on taking care of her mom, and I just happened to be the right technician that day.

t3_c87dzn,How I learned that you can brick iPads by cheating on popular apps.,"OK, here we go: It's a story I've been meaning to tell to you guys for a while now. It's not *technically* tech support, so if it doesn't fit this sub please let me know.  

I used to work for a fairly large tech retail chain in the Netherlands like 3 - 4 years ago. We sold tablets, laptops, smartphones, stuff like that, also Apple products. It was a quiet afternoon, weekday, so not much to do but stand around and watch wacky videos on our 4k iMacs.  

Cue a dad walking in with his I think about 10-years-old son. They approached me and politely asked for help.  

&gt; Dad: ""Tell the nice man what happened.""  
&gt; Kid: ""Everytime I try to launch an app on my iPad it just goes back to the home screen.""  
&gt; Me: ""Hmm, that's odd. I can look into it for you but please note that we do charge a fee of €25,- for service if it turns out to take longer than a few minutes.""  
&gt; Dad: ""Ok, sure. Just fix it please.""  

My boss was in the store as well, so I told him I'd be busy with this customer and started looking into what the issue could be. The kid was right. Every time you tried to start an app or even get into the settings menu or whatever, the iPad would instantly close the app and return to the home screen. There was no visible damage to the device. It even had one of those huge foam covers around it.  

&gt; Me: ""Well, I can't see what's causing your issue right now. I'll go into the back and see what we can do for you. Please wait here.""
&gt; Dad: ""Ok, do you think it's serious?""  
&gt; Me: ""Don't know yet, but if it turns out to be serious there is not much we can do, we can send it to a repair company for you but they'll just send it back unrepaired since it's probably a software issue.""  
&gt; Dad: ""Damn, well ok. Have a look then.""  

I took the iPad to the back. First order of business was, af course: Google the problem. Lo and behold: one of the first results I found was a page explaining how some kid had bricked his iPad trying to cheat a popular app about crushing various colours of candy. Turns out that by not starting the app for a while, you could get points you needed to buy lives and stuff. By reverting the years on the device way back, waiting for the battery to die, and then restarting your device and putting it on the current date and time you could trick the app into giving you a whole heap of points because it thought you hadn't launched it in years. Turns out this kid tried to take that cheat to max level and reverted his iPad to the earliest possible date; Jan 1st, 1970 - causing the infamous 1970 iPad bug.  

I returned to the store to find the dad and kid impatiently waiting for me.  

&gt;Dad: ""Did you fix it?""  
&gt;Me: ""Well, no, I can't. I'm very sorry. But I think I do know what caused the problem.""  
&gt;Dad: ""Well then, what is it?""  
&gt;Me, turning to kid: ""Do you play [popular app]?""  
&gt;Kid, realising he's busted: ""...yes.""  
&gt;Me: ""And did you try to *cheat* the app?""  
&gt;Kid: ""...yes.""  
&gt;Me, turning to dad: ""He reverted the date on your device to 1970, causing the iPad software to break. Depleting the battery completely might fix the problem. If it doesn't, you'll need to bring it to an official Apple store to see if they can fix it."" (side note: there's only a handful of those in the Netherlands, many of them far away from our little town.)  
&gt;Dad, turning to kid: ""[insert angry Turkish yelling at kid]""  
&gt;Me: ""Sir, I'm sorry but I'll have to charge the service fee.""  
&gt;Dad: ""THIS IS COMING OUT OF YOUR ALLOWANCE, [SON NAME]! YOU WON'T BE SEEING THAT IPAD FOR WEEKS!""  

They leave the store after paying the fee, the dad still angrily mumbling to the son, never to be seen again. My boss gives me the side-eye, I explain what happens. We both have a good laugh about it for a few minutes and go about our work.

t3_c8glrq,Why telephone wiring and network wiring are not the same,"Telco techs who are new to network stuff - and have no training in such because they already know everything - are a menace.

We had a store that dropped offline for several minutes at a time, several times a day. We knew it was the telco's problem, which is the worst one in the world, but the *only* option in this particular small city. But they wouldn't admit it. We went around and around, telling them the decades old bundle coming in from the street was shot, but they insisted there was nothing wrong with it.

In the end, we were right, but in ways beyond our imagining.

I was there (200 miles from the office) for other reasons, but took a look at the point of entry to see if I could spot anything out of place. Before we bought the store, the previous owners had upgraded from SDSL to T-1. Not an usual thing, especially then, but. It turned out, the little box that the T-1 terminated in (that belonged to the telco) was mounted about a foot to the right of the little box the SDSL had been terminated in, and the cat5 (which belonged to us) was too short. So the telco tech extended it. (The manager was certain - he'd been the manager at the time it happened, years earlier.) With **wire nuts** (technically, the little crimp connectors that look like wire nuts). There was about six inches of wire, stripped of the outer insulation, and carefully uncoiled, with the little wire-nut crimp connectors in the middle. Sigh.

So we brought in a wiring specialist to pull new cat5 down from our upstairs communications closet. He, correctly, refused to punch it into the telco's little box. The next day, the telco tech shows up, punches it in, does some testing, and decided that the bundle coming in from the street was shot, and needed to be replaced. Bastards.

(Now, of course, the wiring *under* the street, just as old, is also shot. One of the techs, off the record, admitted to one of our managers that they simply don't have enough good twisted pairs for all their customers in the neighborhood, so they move the bad pairs around, and wait for the new ~~victim~~ customer to call and complain. I would sell my mother's soul to the devil to replace this telco, but that would cost us more in construction costs to tear up the street than my car cost.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c8fu70,Interesting workaround for broken printer,"I used to work in an IT-adjacent field and had to field plenty of stupid IT questions from stupid people. It was almost worth incurring massive amounts of student debt that will follow me to my grave, to leave my old job behind for grad school. Or so I thought. 

Within my first week of starting school, I got a job in my school library. It was the perfect place to get paid to study and do homework and not much else. Most people didn’t need any help besides checking out books and, since I clearly had no IT powers, most students were pretty understanding when I had to direct them to IT to solve computer issues or problems related to their student ID/print card. 

There was one guy, though, who was constantly trying to get other people to deal with problems for him. I was friendly with one of his TAs who told me that he treated TA sessions like 1:1 tutoring sessions and expected professors/TAs to cater to him during class/office hours. He did the same thing at the library. When he had a research paper due, without any cursory research, he would whine to the front desk staff that he didn’t know what books to check out. He was essentially trying to get front desk staff to do his research for him. Similarly, when he couldn’t print to the school printers because his credentials weren’t authorized, he wanted me to solve the issue. I explained I didn’t have access to his account and couldn’t make changes, but I told him it was an easy fix and even gave him a guide the library had on opening tickets. He didn’t understand why I wouldn’t open up a ticket and deal with IT for him. So that’s just some context on this guy, which sort of explains why I acted the way I did. 

The day this story takes place the school printers were not functioning. Students could scan &amp; email or photocopy &amp; print stuff, but they couldn’t print from the school computers or their own computers. I opened a ticket for the issue, but I wasn’t expecting it to be resolved until the next day because the on-site IT staff had already left for the day and the IT staff at the main campus (all staff at the main campus, actually) treated our tiny grad program like the red headed stepchild of the university. 

Most students were able to deal with it. Not Mr. Needy, though. He immediately launched into a whiny rant about a paper he had 15 minutes to turn in. Here’s an approximation of our conversation:

Needy: But I haaaaave to tuuuuurn a paper in. The professor said it had to be printed out. Can’t you just fix the printer?

Me: Sorry.  IT has to do it. I’m sure if you talk to your professor she’ll understand. Other people will probably have the same issue. 

Needy: I don’t understand why yoooooou won’t just fix it, though. 

Me: I can’t fix the printer. I’m not IT. 

Needy: But you work in the library. Why can’t you fix it? It needs to be printed out. 

Me: I check out books. I can’t just fix network issues. 

Needy: But what do *you* expect *me* to do? How do *you* expect *me* to print my paper? 

Me: Talk to your professor. It will be fine. 

Then he started to launch into another round of what-do-*you*-expect-*me*-to-dos, like I exist to solve his problem, but I was done with him. I indicated to one of the people lined up behind him to bring their book forward so I could check them out, and he kind of stomped off. 

A few minutes later, after I had checked everyone else out, I saw Needy gingerly pressing his laptop’s screen to the photocopier. His laptop screen did not open at at 180 degree angle, so he was trying to kind of get the screen as close to the edge of the photocopier and let the keyboard rest against the photocopier menu screen. He periodically lifted the laptop up to scroll down and the pressed it back against the photocopier. When he picked up the photocopied pages out of the tray, he looked at them and then dramatically crumpled them up (because of course his stupid idea wasn’t going to work) and threw them away. 

This guy was at least 25 years old, and he couldn’t work out sending his professor an email with an explanation of the issue, an apology, a promise to turn in a hard copy later, and the paper as an attachment. Fucking idiot.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c8gj2f,Failure to Boot,"This story is from back in 2015 - I was a level 2 user support student technician at my university, primarily servicing faculty and administrative assistant’s machines. A lot of the latter category are a bit on in years, so I would pretty frequently get some really, uh, “simple” tickets. This is by far the worst one, though. 

The person calling it in was a regular at our SOC. Among the admin assistants in the Economics office (which as I’ve stated is a pretty old and less-than-tech-savvy group to begin with) she was famous for being unable to do anything whatsoever with a computer - her greatest hits include calling IT to help her change a printout from portrait to landscape and refusing to take the computer aptitude training that the department required of the admin assistants because she didn’t see the need for it, despite constantly asking her fellow admins for assistance opening Microsoft Word. She was a nice enough person, but had a tendency to get a little short when she got stressed, which she unavoidably did while dealing with technical issues. Call her “Gladys”. 

It was close to the end of my shift on a Tuesday that summer when we got a call from Gladys - her computer wasn’t booting. I took the ticket and went to check it out. When I got there, she was already in a huff and informed me that she had a lot to get done that day and could I please fix her computer as soon as humanly possible because she couldn’t be late leaving today she had a doctor’s appointment and the last time she got delayed because of technical issues she had to reschedule and that’s why she has this appointment today actually and . . .

After assuring her that I would try my best to get the issue sorted out by 4:30, I went over to her machine and pressed the power button. It turned on immediately. 

Gladys saw the machine boot up, and stared at me.  “I swear it wasn’t doing that before”, she said. 

“I understand, sometimes technical issues can come and go like that. If it happens again, please call us and we can try to troubleshoot”, I said. I went back to the office and closed out for the day. The next morning, the same ticket got created. I went back to the economics office and found Gladys visibly irate. 

“You didn’t believe me when I told you about this issue yesterday, and it’s happening again. There’s clearly something wrong with my computer.”

I took a look at the power cable to make sure it wasn’t hanging out of the socket (figuring that she might be pulling it out from under the desk to turn it on or something) and checked the A/V for the same problem. Nothing. I turned the machine on and it booted again. Gladys was incensed. 

“This is fucking ridiculous. You aren’t any help because it always works for you! It’s only when I try to turn it on that it doesn’t.” 

Something clicked in my mind - I asked Gladys to please show me how she was attempting to turn on the computer. I watched, open-mouthed, as she extended her hot pink, gel coated index fingernail towards the front of the machine. As her finger neared the machine, her hand lowered - just slightly! - angling towards. . . towards. . .

The USB port. She was sticking her finger in the USB port. 

As it happens, Gladys did not have a computer at home, and prior to the day before (on which, I learned, she had accidentally shut down her machine), she had never tried to turn her computer on. She simply always left it on. 

And that’s how I learned that it’s always best to get the user to replicate an issue they’re having rather than try yourself. 

tldr: User thought the USB port was the power button.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c8fkqq,10th time is the charm,"77-year-old lady. Says it all. She's gotten a new iPad and wanted to set it up but has forgotten her ID password. As polite as old ladies can be.

She knew what the ID is and it was ""oldlady.ol@gmail"" and I confirmed it. Her account was not 2FA and she could receive her emails. I thought it would be a simple 10 minute job of her sending a password recovery email, make a password and move on.

Cut to the page where she types her ID in and we are just over 6 minutes into the call. She types her email in, ""... is not an ID."" 

(OL is Old Lady)

Me: ""Try again, there must be a typo there.""  
OL: \*checks what she wrote\* ""Oh you're right, I typed @g.mail""

It took us 35 MINUTES for us to get to the next page. 

It was a loop of: 

""... is not an ID."" &gt; ""Try again, there must be a typo there."" &gt; ""You're right, I missed X or Y."" &gt; Remind her to tap on the text box and correct her mistake &gt; Have her read to me what she wrote &gt; Her reading it correctly and saying something to the effect of ""This time I'm sure it's right!"" &gt; Remind her that she needs to tap Continue &gt; ""... is not an ID."" 

Btw, she used to be a teacher, so spelling is not something she wouldn't know.

Eventually, we got to the page to reset the password. I thought this would be my doom as now she can't see what she's typing, but after typing the new password and the confirmation in the same text box, she changed the password on her 2nd attempt.

Confirming it on her old iPad and setting up the new one took no longer than normal and we ended exchanging pleasantries and her wanting to email someone to raise my wages.

It was frustrating as all hell and made me go to lunch at 4PM on the verge of passing out from hunger but, and I told her this too, it's better to have someone who doesn't know much but be polite and understanding than to be someone skilled but impatient and incomprehensive.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c88md9,The master becomes the student,"So this happened at the weekend and I’m only over the embarrassment (nearly!) now. 

My girlfriend planned a surprise trip for my birthday last weekend and off we went to a lovely hotel. 

Very nice room with the added benefit of the room having a smart tv to access my netflix account, YouTube etc. that had a mini-router / mains plug attached for WiFi and took an ethernet feed from a wall socket. 

All working fine on Friday so music playing away as we got ready for dinner and drinks and all good for the Saturday morning hangover. 

Came back from lunch and nada - wifi seems fine but lan is dead. No great stress as we were chilling out before getting ready for dinner but of course I try to look knowledgable and pull my superman pants on! 

Oh how fickle the fates are....

I turned everything on and off, pulled all rj45 cables and reseated them a couple of times (in case housekeeping knocked something loose), checked the tv apps for ethernet connectivity checks on. The tv was wall mounted and on a movable fixture so was very easy to get in and around. 

Nothing - dead still. 

Tried all of that again but still no wired connection showing - only WiFi. 

Thinking that maybe the connection was compromised at the hotel main box I called reception and spoke to a very pleasant receptionist who (of course) asked me to turn everything off and then on again and if that didn’t work then he’d come up to the room.  

I thought maybe the IT gremlins would take that as tribute enough and so turned all off and on again a couple of times but still no joy. 

So I rang reception and sure enough the patient receptionist agreed to call up. 

I sweat the following is verbatim the truth - may I blue screen every day if I’m lying. 

He walked in, used the light on his phone to look at the cables and fixtures, switched the router off and on again at the mains (not even a reset) and once it booted up it connected perfectly. 

I was happy to thank him and was genuinely appreciative but my girlfriend couldn’t resist informing him that obviously my 20 years in IT wasn’t up to his insider knowledge. 

Honest to gods - he wasn’t in the room for a full 60 seconds but the embarrassment will linger for years.",talesfromtechsupport

See this user's internet was a bit spotty, which is normal in some areas that are a bit more remote then others(like the user's!). it sucks, but you chose the boonies where it's hard to maintain some of the hardware. So he started researching and heard about malicious software that could have implanted itself in his computer. Well our dear user is a very learned individual so it was definitely not anything he did yhat caused his PC to slow down.  

Instead he started looking at his equipment from us. Which included going into the user settings of his DVR box, and a cursory google search led him to understand that some of the open source software we used, something he gleaned from reading the software licenses, could allow people to remotely access his device. You know, like how we roll out updates for the box or his services?  

but no, he called me because he wanted help removing the rather necessary software from the dvr box as he was certain someone had maliciously tampered with it and it was slowing his internet.

Though my mom isn’t tech support, she had to be that for her friend who’d never really used a mouse on a desktop computer before. Mom said she walked into the friend’s office and she has the mouse in the air aimed at the computer screen and moving it around, so she watches for a second. Then, she starts furiously left and right clicking, so mom finally asks her what I’m the world she’s doing. She said she couldn’t get the mouse to work, that she has it in the air aimed at “the arrow” on the screen, but when she tries to drag it one way or the other it just stayed still. She told my mom the thing just doesn’t work!

After laughing hysterically (not making her friend feel bad, they enjoy laughing at the expense of each other) and her friend joining in, realizing the laughter means she doesn’t have a clue as to what she’s doing, my mom explained it to her.

t3_c7qrvi,Is now a bad time?,"***Shortish and sweet.***

I had recently (at the time, on a Thursday) finished setting up a major new networking system at the local five-Doctor Medical centre in my small Australian country town.

The doctors also provided 24 hour coverage at our local hospital.

One of the GPs (Dr L) was leaving soon and had a couple or three laptops that she wanted to donate and was going to remove her personal stuff first.

I'd suggested that I'd do it if she was unsure and I'd set them up with the latest Windows (***98SE***!!!) since she had all the CDs that came with them.

Anyhoo, fast forward to the weekend and I, coincidentally, started a medication that I was allergic to (didn't know until then) and I had an anaphylactic reaction and was rushed to the hospital by ambulance and met by Dr L.

As she's jabbing me with adrenaline she says that she'll keep me in overnight for observation (no problem - Universal Health Care rocks).

After faffing around doing blood draws and more jabbing, Dr L asks ""Since you're going to be in here anyway, would it be all right for me to bring in the laptops for you to look at?""

We both had a good chuckle when we realised what she had asked and, yes, I did have a look at the laptops for her.

I guess she felt that since she was never off the clock, nobody else should be, too.

Not fair, she was a great person and doctor and well missed within the community.

Dragging my butt into the office, still recovering from a weekend of doing absolutely nothing but recovering from the last week. Exhaling the last cold air of dawn from my lungs and breathing in the stale hot air of the office air mixed with the smell of coffee and toast from the early starting staff members.  Making my way to my cubicle, I ignore the frantic hand waving of the human resources (two lies for the price of one) who are begging me to show them how to operate their computers for them since their brains haven't warmed up sufficently to remember how to do their jobs.

And to think I share the road driving to work with these people in the morning.

I arrive at my cubicle, my tiny corner of refuge, my Fortress of Solitude that everyone knows about and visit incessantly.  Firing up the computer, I again mentally toy with the idea of make a false carboard wall to disguise my cubicle as a storage room full of cardboard boxes.  The computer on, I log in and start dealing with the email and trouble tickets from the weekend while my phone starts ringing off the hook (I swear these people watch me on hidden cameras waiting for me to sit down).

I fight my way through the weekend spam buildup, and make my way to the trouble tickets.  First one in the queue is from one of our Branch Managers on Sunday.

BRANCHMGR:  ""USER has finished with us today (Sunday).  Please disable his access ASAP""

OK, nothing like starting the day with a employee deletion, even if this user wasn't one of the bad ones.  Better than a cappuccino enema some would say.

Started employee termination proceedings.  No need to refer to the instructions, I wrote them.  Do all the necessary changes in our sales system, change and disable AD and backup then delete the users Exchange mailbox.  Just as I hit the delete button to finalise the user deletion, the ticket queue dinged.  I watched as the final step processed telling me the user had been totally deleted, then tabbed to the ticketing queue.  The Branch Manager had sent an update.

BRANCHMGR: ""I made a mistake.  USER doesn't finished up till tomorrow (Tuesday).  Can you please reinstate his access as he can't get into his computer.""

That's it, FML, Monday morning had won already, and it was so early in the game.  I went outside to stand in the slowly warming sun, toasted a ""well done, ya bastard"" to Monday with my hot chocolate and wished for a cigarette even though I have never smoked in my life.

t3_c7tuvc,That One Story... (LPT &amp; a kinda funny story),"I've worked in IT for over a decade now and I used to think about going back to school so I could advance my career more, but to be honest I really didn't think that the extra responsibility and mountain of student debt would be worth it at this stage in my life (change my mind?). At this point though, I've got a decent paying job ($46k/yr NON-salary w/ benefits for a T1 gig and I'm getting bumped up to $54k/yr in a month or so because they're giving me a promotion whether I want it or not), with a great shift (3.5 12hr overnight shifts per week), and the ability to work remote if I ever decide to move out of state. I also have an offer to work doing desktop support for a city department making the same amount of money w/ all the other benefits and a union, so yay! For a while there I had problems getting positions that paid what I know my experience is worth in the area I live in though, until I came across a LPT I thought I'd share with the folks here: get a story. Let me explain...  


In this field you're typically interviewed once on an HR basis to make sure you haven't been fired before and can show up to work on time, etc. (can't really help you out with this one, but there are plenty of posts/advice columns out there that can help), and then again by the actual IT folks who know what the job actually entails. Now in most fields having over a decade's worth of experience working the same types of jobs makes this seem more like a formality than anything, but in IT they typically want to see that you're looking to eventually advance to more technical positions so hopefully you'll move up and they don't have to take a chance at hiring someone to be a Sys Admin that ends up being unreliable/doesn't know WTF they're doing. But looking at it from a strictly statistical standpoint (try saying that 3x fast), then well... there's probably 10x more T1 positions than there are those more technical positions, so at some point it becomes an effort &amp; responsibility vs. pay equation that moving up just doesn't seem to benefit me as well. So how do I market myself to those IT interviewers in order to not have them looking at my lack of programming languages or intricacies of networking, as negatives to keep from hiring me? I just tell them a story that I probably should've posted here ages ago about a customer I once had:  


Be me.  
In the mid 2000's working for one of the largest ISP's in the country at the time in my first tech role.   
Customer calls up and says that they have already called in and talked to another tech who told them that once they had installed a wireless card in their desktop then we would help them to set up the wireless connection on their modem. Customer is an older guy who says that he sent his wife down to Wal-Mart to pick up a wireless card and had just installed it. ""No problem then,"" I naively replied.  
I walk through the process of trying to find the wireless card and I am coming up with nothing.   
No wireless icon in their taskbar,   
no wireless card or unknown devices in their device manager,   
no nothing.   
So I explain that unfortunately it looks like their wireless card hasn't been installed properly -   
""Maybe it's not in the right slot on the motherboard, maybe it just needs drivers installed. Who knows? But this is something that you'd need to get in touch with the wireless card manufacturer to get them to help you out with this. If you can give me the name on the packaging then I'd be glad to Google them and see if I can come up with their tech support number for you, then you can call us up and we'd be glad to help you out with the rest of the process.""  
Customer's ticked off that we're not able to help out with this, but I explained that it's not our card so we aren't allowed to assist any further, so they were relatively cool about this.  
Hear customer rummaging around for a bit and he comes back to the phone, ""So I found the packaging, but I was just wondering... why did they give me this phone with the wireless card?""  
WTF.jpg?! Wait... no way...

""Ummmm... sir, can you tell me who the manufacturer of the card is, please?""   
""Tracphone.""  
 **/)\_-)** The man had put the green card Tracphone used to package their cellphones with, into the disk drive (this was back when there were still computers that actually used those 3D models of the ""Save"" icons, kids), and had thought that it was installing a wireless card into his computer. TECHNICALLY, not wrong - but still...

Long story, shortened (at least a little) I got the model of the phone he had purchased, checked the website for the store where they had bought it, checked the price they had paid and was able to find a wireless card they claimed to have in stock for about the same/less than he had paid for the phone, gave him the model number and the SKU, gave him the number for the OEM's tech support, and made the disclaimer about how I couldn't guarantee that Wal-Mart would take back the phone since it had been opened already.   


Moral of the story: Customer service skills are still about 90% of the job and if you can incorporate that into a story where you're going above and beyond to help a user to get their issue resolved in the most idiot-proof way possible WITHOUT making it sound like you think the user IS an idiot, or losing your temper, then you're worth your weight in gold to most customer-facing tech positions. Bonus points if you can make it kinda funny.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_c7lsee,Client doesn't like their own work and refuses to pay their salesman,"So, for a bit of background, my day job is management in a foundry but I own a small business where I make custom computers and sell one-offs as well as support those. Mix in some data recovery and I've got a healthy business as a hobby that gives me some extra money and more leverage in turning problematic potential customers away because I can afford to do that.

That being said, I'm usually pretty good at picking up on customers who smell like BS and finding the right way of saying ""I will not be able to provide you with what you need"" and Over-extending Customer didn't really trip those. He's got a fairly decent idea of what he wants and is pretty good at telling me that he wanted a system that would get him 60fps in his games, can stream, and host  Minecraft server simultaneously. His other thing is he wanted something that just looked ""badass"" and luckily I had a system I had assembled from used parts and was getting ready to sell that would fit his bill. Then comes the first problematic conversation between Over-extending Customer and myself.

OC: I don't like the look of the front, it would be kickass if we could see into it.

Me: That's no problem, I could reuse the case somewhere else. I could absolutely order a new case if you wanted to pick one out, you'd just have to pay the difference.

OC: Nah, I'll just put a window in the front like those cool ones. Not worth spending extra.

Me: Are you sure? If you're willing to put a deposit down on it, I don't see why not.

OC: Yeah, let's do that.

So, I pulled the panel off and he asked for another case badge as he was certain the one that was on there wasn't going to live and he said he liked it since it pulled it together to make it feel ""store bought"" which is the opposite of what I want, but I'm not going to argue with that. I got a deposit for the cost of the case figuring this would be a week or two and he'd get something he was happy with and pay the rest of it off.

This is where my bullshit-o-meter started to go off. He fell off the face of the earth for over a month. I have a fairly expensive system sitting and we're about to hit the end of the deposit period, meaning I could just swap cases and re-sell the hardware if he still doesn't contact me or pay of the system. Our next (and final) conversation goes through text like this...

OC: I dropped the panel off.

Me: I've been trying to get a hold of you. Your grace period on your deposit is up in less than a week. When I get home I'll put the panel on and send you the invoice.

OC: I don't want it.

Me: What do you mean?

OC: I. Do. Not. Want. The. Com. Pu. Ter.

Me: Your deposit is non-refundable, are you sure that you do not want it?

OC: The tower looks like shit. You shouldn't have let me try to mod it. I don't want it. Everything has a refund.

Me (in bewilderment): There's really no refund on the deposit, and you were the one to modify the case. I can rework the front panel to get it to where you want if you'd like.

That was it. Never heard anything else. When I got home from work that night he had left the front panel at the door, and he did exactly what he said. Cut a huge hole in the front and if he had executed it well it would have been pretty slick looking, but he spraypainted the front with no prep and clearly no experience and did a pretty shoddy job of cutting to the shape he wanted. Fast forward to today where I'm doing my best to recover this front panel due to time constraints and to hopefully break even.

This is the story of why the most involvement customers will now get is picking out what they want and watching until cash has exchanged hands.

**TL;DR** Customer wants to try case modding. Does not like the final product, I find out it's because he's unable to cut the panel and really laid the Krylon on it without the most basic paint prep. The verdict is still out whether he'll try for his refund or not.",talesfromtechsupport

At this point it is too late for me to get the phone out there plus I was already booked out for the rest of the day. My dispatch guy calls me and says they're really antsy for that new phone. I tell him it will have to wait till Monday. **Outdated\_User** tells him they will have someone there for me at 8:30 am. 

&amp;#x200B;

Monday Morning rolls around and I head straight to the client from my apartment with the phone in hand. I walk into the office right at 8:30 and someone peaks around the corner.

&amp;#x200B;

**Office\_Lady:** Can I help you?

**Me:** I'm here to replace a phone. Someone was going to be here to show me where the phone is.

**Office\_Lady:** Hmm, I'm not sure. Hey Jill, do you know who's phone needs to be fixed?

**Jill:** \**Indistinguishable office noises*

**Office\_Lady:** I'll just take you upstairs.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm taken upstairs and I start checking phones. Finally I find the desk with an unlit phone and I get to work. I check the cable and trace it down under the desk and find a small 8 port switch. Surely this little switch wouldn't provide PoE (Power over ethernet. This is used in cases where you can use the data cable to both power the phone and supply data). I find the PoE injector and it's unplugged from the wall. I plug it in and sure enough the phone comes right up. I make a test call to my cell phone and then I head downstairs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Office\_Lady:** Wow, done already?

**Me:** Yes, the phone was just unplugged.

**Office\_Lady:** *\*Suprised Pikachu Face* 

&amp;#x200B;

So I leave and head to the office with the new phone still in hand. I'm mildly agitated that it was simple but hey, at least it was simple right? 

&amp;#x200B;

I let the dispatch guy know the job is done and to charge $45.00 for a trip charge and $90.00 for IP Labor at an hour minimum. Which comes out to about $150.00 with tax. Because the phone was unplugged.  I look forward to the phone call from **Outdated\_User** asking to explain that invoice.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c7hyo9,Wedding Bells,"Here's an extremely short story which recently happened to me. My now wife agreed that I should post it here. 

It was the day of my wedding and all was going well. The vows had been read, the rings exchanged, and the first dance had.

My wife and I were now sitting at our sweetheart table, enjoying our recently cut cake and watching some of our guests dance while others were coming up to wish us well and chat a bit. As I sat savoring the sweet icing I saw someone from my side of the family approaching. They walked swiftly, a smile on their face. I waited, expecting a congratulations. Instead, I was greeted with a phone being shoved in my face displaying various models of laptops. ""Can you help me figure out which of these is better?"" Were the words out of this person's mouth. 

All I could do was sit with with a look of disbelief on my face. A few moments later I simply replied ""not today,"" turned to my wife to ask if that really happened, and had a bit of a laugh.",talesfromtechsupport

She says, ""I just dialed the number that's on your paperwork because I can't get to the internet on my computer."" I open up a tool and check the modem/router. No problems. I use my phone to check the alarm system.  I can see everything so no problems. I tell her, ""There's nothing wrong here. I get off in about 45 so I'll check it when I get home.""

I get home run a ping to Google's DNS server. No response. I run IP config. 169.254.x.x. I run ipconfig /all. Media state disconnected. She had airplane mode on.

She says, ""My building still has power so can we please try to restore service.""

I said, ""Alright. Let me have your account number and see if can reach our switch."" I log into our core router and, of course, the interface is down. I ask her if she can verify the color of the lights on the uplink of the switch.

t3_c7ejmx,Woman threatening to sue for lost pictures of her kids that had been missing for five years.,"Just read a short story on here about someone threatening to sue and was inspired to write about my experience. Mine is much longer, but I hope you enjoy it.

Having worked in tech support for five years at the time, I knew fairly well how people can get but this was a first. 

Woman comes in for her appointment, with two minutes to spare. When she was told that it had been cancelled, she demanded her two minutes. Me being the person they call to calm people down, I ended up helping her. My lunch was scheduled for the time that her appointment had ended. This all matters later.

I start to help her. Her computer kept giving her a warning sign that the HD was full. She ignored it and kept using it. Eventually the computer wouldn’t let her log into her user because it was so full. A lovely feature of an old OS that is no longer present. 

So I do the usually, clear caches via terminal so we can at least log in and clear stuff out. 

We get logged in and I immediately go to the trash folder. It’s absolutely full. I’m talking 20GB of info. *Facepalm*

I explain that she needs to empty her trash, but that we should check it to be sure there isn’t anything in there that she actually needs. Obviously she doesn’t know how the trash works and I like to be certain.

She immediately says, I’m afraid to empty the trash because I can’t find pictures of my children that I am missing. They have all passed away and when I got this computer, the guy at (insert random IT shop) transferred all of my info and showed me that the photos are here, but I can’t find them. 

I open the trash, search .jpeg and various other photo file forms. Nothing comes up. Still being concerned I start searching her files (with her approval and while she watches) explaining everything along the way. There are absolutely no photos of her children on her computer. At this point in time we are halfway through my lunch. 

I ask if she still has her old computer. She says yes. I explain that we should probably search that one to see if we can find them and get them transferred for her. She insists that they are on her new computer, that she can’t use her computer without emptying the trash, and that she wants me to delete the files in her trash and she will come back with her old computer. 

I am now super hesitant to remove any files. Period. I show her how to empty the trash, but explain that until we locate the missing files, I don’t want to be the one deleting things. 

She sighs and says, I understand. I will delete this stuff right now. She goes through the trash bit by bit and ends up emptying it. She thanks me for my time and leaves. My entire lunch break is over and I now need to rearrange my schedule to take a 15min break because there is no way to fit in a full lunch. 


A week later I get pulled into the managers office and am told I have an important phone call, a phone call from our legal department. They asked me about this woman and to detail the entire interaction. Luckily it was memorable enough (due to the timing) that I could give them exact timestamps of our interaction, what was said, the emotions that I could read from her body language, my hesitance, and the outcome.

They watched the security footage and everything I said was exactly correct, almost to the minute. Apparently, the woman went back to the IT shop and they confirmed that there were no photos of her children on the computer. They weren’t malicious and didn’t say that I deleted them, but confirmed what I had already told her. She assumed that I deleted them when I emptied the trash. 

Hold up. *I* emptied the trash? Noooooooo. You did. 

Anyway, she got a lawyer and tried to sue me and the company for emotional damaged and destruction of property or some shit. And when I say ‘tried’ obviously it didn’t get past a short phone call after I recounted the interaction. 

I thought I was done with the situation, until she came in for another appointment, told the check in person that she specifically didn’t want to work with me, and proceeded to occupy my colleagues time to try to find the photos that I deleted. Yes, she stuck to that story. 

She wasn’t ever rude or angry, but the fact that she tried to sue me is odd. Almost as if it were setup. I will never know, but had she continued to pursue suing the company, she would have lost horribly.


TLDR: Woman’s computer won’t let her log in because her HDD was full. Had 20GB in the trash. Told her to delete trash, but because she clearly didn’t know how trash worked asked her to go through and be sure nothing important was there. She mentions that for the last five years she has been missing photos of her dead children asks me to find them. I can’t. She empties her trash on her own accord. Leaves happy, or I thought happy. Tries to sue the company. No actual suit happens. She comes back some odd months later for help again. 

UPDATE: for those saying they would back up her hard drive or ban her from the premises. I worked for Apple. Didn’t want to say it for fear of the apple pitchforks coming out. 

We don’t and cannot backup anyone’s data for any reason. It is the customers sole responsibility. Firstly, we see so many people everyday that it isn’t feasible and imagine the lawsuits they would have if we did back up their data and somehow lost the backup. I know, that would be tough to do, but you haven’t seen some of the crazy shit I have seen that is 1 in a billion. But the fact that we see millions of people across thousands of stores is enough to keep your hands off of peoples data.

Second, why would we service her again? Well. Apple receives hundreds of these threats a day. They quickly clarify the situation with the employee that the customer interacted with and advise the lawyer not to pursue legal action. Open and shut. Most people think it’s a good idea and that they could get millions, idk what lawyer in their right mind would support that person and entertain such a petty suit, but they do. 

Also, it isn’t hard to make an appointment with a fake name and hope the two people in the store that could identify you aren’t there, or are too busy to notice. It happens more often than you think.

t3_c7dzfi,Network admin manager doesn't know how to subnet,"I had a call where a customer's network vendor was calling in to check on the IP range for their client. After pulling up the account and verifying them,  I told her, ""The customer purchased a /27 IP block.""

She said, ""So they have 27 usable IPs?""

Baffled, I said, ""No, a /27 gives them 29 usable IPs.""

Then, she asked for the subnet mask. I say, ""The last octet is .244.""

She says, ""So the subnet mask is 0.0.0.224.""

I said, ""No, this is a class C space. It's all 255 except the last octet.""

She then says, ""So 0.0.255.224 or 224.0.0 255?""

I say, ""No, 255.255.255.224.""

After playing this game for around 30 minutes, she says that her manager wants to speak to me. I'm thinking that I'll finally have someone who knows what they're doing. I read off everything just the same: /27 block, .224 as the last octet of the subnet mask, gave DNS info. Everything was good until the very last statement.

She asked, ""Just to be clear, which IPs are usable?""

I said, ""x.x.x.226 all the way through."" (I work for an ISP)

She then asked, ""So .225 through .255 is usable?""

I go silent and stop myself because I almost say, ""In what world is .255 is usable IP, lady?"" I just say, ""No, .254 is the last usable.""",talesfromtechsupport

She was not checking the circuit itself, she was checking behind her firewall during her business operation hours. I advised her that she has to check the speed without her equipment because she need to make sure the speed is not being caused by the firewall. She gets even louder and demands a report. I log into the CPE and see over-utilization. 

I run a report in our reporting tool and it shows a solid line for 5 hours during their operational hours. I send the report to her and tell her that they are maxing out the circuit. She asks me what that means. I tell her that she is going over her bandwidth and everything over the bandwidth is being discarded. She gets furious and demands to know why we are limiting her bandwidth.
 I tell her that it's what she signed up for per her contract.  She takes down my name and the ticket and says she's going to get her lawyer and sue for limiting the bandwidth.

I tell her that she's going to need to resize or condense what she is trying to send because it's way too big for what outlook allows (this is before dropbox,  Google drive, etc). She gets mad and says that I'm lying. I tell her to read the error message on the screen that affirms my statement. 

She then says,  ""How can it be too big when I've just sent an attachment that's +470 kB?"" 

I tell her, ""Ma'am, 1 kB is a thousand times smaller than 1 MB.""

She tells me, ""That's absurd! 470 is larger than 45.""

I go silent for about 2 minutes. Then I restate the size difference. She gets mad and demands to speak to billing. I transfer her and the billing agent sends me a message (about 20 min later) saying how the lady cancelled her service because she wasn't able to send a 45 MB attachment.

I’ve agreed to re-organize a co-location facility in the spare bedroom of a student apartment in exchange for hosting two servers there. First step is getting some shelving units from a closed fast food restaurant in the suburbs.  
  
On the way back, I negotiate a deal with my roommate. In exchange for the keys to the Burger King and the use of his truck, I will trade him an ounce of really good marijuana, fill the tank on his truck _and_ clean it.  
  
Getting the keys, driving and finding the place takes longer than I planned, so I get to the Burger King around 1am.   
  
I park the truck behind the BK and aim the headlights at the back door, half to let me see and half because it’s damn spooky here.  
  
I fumble through the key ring and after the third try, get the door half-way open. It seems that someone has tried to break in from the hinge end and the door has a hard stop half way through. I contemplate knocking the pins out, but I don’t want to take the time.  
  
I’m greeted with a smell that I see before I fully comprehend how bad it is. If this was a newspaper comic, I’d see lines coming out of the open door.  
  
I move a mop and bucket out of the way and make my way in. I yell a few times to let the rats know that I’m here and that they should avoid me.  
  
That’s what I tell myself.   
  
There’s what feels like a half-inch of rancid congealed fry grease on the floor. My well worn Doc Martens slide like hockey pucks on this surface. If it was hot outside, it's sweltering in here.   
  
Luckily, suitable racks are in the first room past the door.  
  
Unluckily, they’re covered with grease. On the top shelf, there are four cardboard ‘bag in a box’ containers of Mel-Fry, a foodservice staple.   
  
Some moron had decided to poke holes in the bag so they’ve drained all over the rack. The other shelves are covered in bags of rotten potatoes.
  
I move the fry oil off the top shelves and spill about 3/4 a cup on me in the process. Great. I look for something to clean my hands off and can only find a bunch of documents.  
  
The bags of potatoes are somehow worse. The first one rips open and thirty pounds of rotten muck spills on the floor and my pants.  
  
The smell gets worse. I’m imagining that they’re boiling with maggots and cockroaches. I’ve got to do something about it.  
  
I stumble out and open Markus’s truck. Rummaging around the cab, I find a dirty bandana. In the lock box in the bed I find a half empty bottle of Jenkins Vodka, which is what you drink when Popov or Taaka is just too damn fancy.   
  
I clean the bandana with the vodka, wipe my hands, then re-clean it with more vodka.  
  
I then wrap the bandana around my face so all I smell is rail vodka and trudge back in to the stench.  
  
I get the rest of the large stuff off the rack and start wheeling it towards the door. Even putting my back to the door and shoving with my legs, it’s not opening another inch.  
  
Luckily, these shelves are designed to disassemble. There are 4 upright stainless steel poles that go through holes in the wire shelves. There are plastic inserts that hold the shelves from sliding down.   
  
I’m able do break down the first rack in about ten minutes and I’m able to load the truck with the first shelving unit.   
 
I need at least two racks and I’d prefer three to put everything together the way I want. I walk back in and realize a few other problems.  
  
* The second rack is also filled with ‘bag in box’ ingredients that have spilled over the floor and rack. It’s also further in the room and the light from Markus’ truck isn’t as useful.  
  
* Markus’ truck is newer than my car, but it’s not as meticulously maintained. I don’t want to rely on the battery.  
  
* I’m going to have to go further into the Burger King where I’m relying the streetlights instead of headlights. I’m going to be eaten by a grue.  
  
I walk back out and turn off the truck’s headlights. I find my way back in and try to pull the second rack towards the door. It’s not rolling easily, perhaps it’s stuck on something I dropped on the floor.   
  
Every few minutes, a car drives past the Burger King, so I have a moment of light to see where things are. I spend that time trying to memorize where everything is, then spend the interval in the dark moving the contents to the floor.   
  
When it comes to disassembly, this rack is much harder. It’s shorter than the first and fits together a little differently. I’m able to remove all the shelves and one of the vertical poles, but the three remaining poles are quite well stuck in the bottom shelf.  
  
I take the one pole with me and explore further, looking for something I can use.  
  
I consider using my lighter to see my way around, but I’m afraid that being soaked in rail vodka and old grease makes me suitable for starting fires, so I table that idea.   
  
I make it to the back side of the counter. I’m crouching down in the hopes that there’s a toolbox or a flashlight.  
  
The counter is facing the three glass walls, so I get a bit more light when the occasional car drives by. I look up from my crouch to see a human figure on the other side of the counter, backlit by headlights.   
  
I grip my stainless steel pole with both hands like a baseball bat, plant my feet and stare at the creepy guy on the other side of the counter.   
  
He’s perfectly still. He’s got to know I’m here and he must be considering his options.  
  
me:”YO, DUDE! I DON’T WANT TO HURT YOU, JUST BACK UP”. 
  
silence. He’s completely fearless. He’s got to be crazy, living in this abandoned Burger King. He’s probably thinking of ways to cut me up and cook me on that filthy grill.   
  
Still not talking or moving. My heart’s thumping and I get that metallic taste of adrenalin. I swing with all my might and I bury the pole in his head with a sickening squeaky crunch. I lose my footing on the greasy tile floor and fall on my back.  
  
I scramble back up and see him still standing there with a six foot pole stuck in his head, right below his crown but above his creepy smile.  
  
Yep, I clocked Burger King.  
  
I remove the pole, make my way back to the remaining rack and using my new-found adrenalin rush, manage to kick the remaining shelf off the poles and load it in Markus’ truck. 
  
I grab a stack of paper tray liners so I don’t get the seats dirty, lock up and drive to a 24 hour self-service car wash.  
  
A stack of quarters later, I’m soaking wet, but the racks and Markus’ truck are squeaky clean. I smell like sweat, wet dog, grease and hot dumpster juice. It’s about 7am by the time I get back to the apartment. I’m able to use a bicycle lock to secure the shelves to the back staircase and I bring the poles into the apartment.   
  
I have just enough time to grab my stuff and get to my 8am class. I grab the syllabus and find a remote spot in the back of the big lecture hall.   
   
My lack of sleep and the exertions of the night start catching up with me about half way through, so I walk out and try to walk quickly to my apartment.  
  
I see potential object of my affections crossing my path. I’d rather not talk to them in my current state, but they turn around after I pass.   
  
My Crush:”Er, LT, is it?”  
  
me:”Yep. I’m sorry, I’ve had a long night and I need to get some sleep and clean myself up”. 
  
My Crush:”I see. I wanted to ask why you were wearing Burger King placemats on your back”. 
  
me:”Ugh. Can I explain later?”  
  
My Crush (smiling):”Sure”.   
  
I go home, take my clothes off in the shower, clean up and nap for an hour and a half.   
  
I then rebuild the small shelf, put the parts to the bigger one on it and roll it to Kevin and Will’s apartment/ co-lo.   
  
I catch up Will while I’m putting the big rack together in the spare bedroom. He’s laughing while I’m still stifling yawns. I want some coffee before I start disconnecting and moving systems, lest things not come back up cleanly.  
  
Will:”You don’t need coffee. You need something stronger”  
  
me:”No, coffee will do me fine”  
  
Will:”This is better. It’s a low dose liquid amphetamine on blotter paper. It’ll keep you level for the next few hours”. 
  
me:”Sure”.  
  
I put the small bit of colored paper on my tongue and start with the systems in their living room. Ever so often I have to grab Will and ask him what services should come back up on the server I just moved. Will sometimes doesn’t remember _whose_ system it is, let alone what it’s _for_.  
  
I guess that’s why hosting with him is so cheap.  
  
I start with my boxes, since I may be tired, but at least I know what they’re supposed to be doing.  
  
I plug them both in and they boot, but none of the services are visible from another system.  
  
me:”Will, are you sure you gave me the right IPs? I’m not seeing anything”. 
  
Will:”well, that’s what you get for hosting on Macs, dumbass”. 
  
me:”Ha. Was that IP 51 and 52 or 151 and 152?”  
  
Will:”I’ve got some 151 right here”. 
  
me:”No. Your drugs suck, by the way. I’m still tired”. 
  
Will (rummaging through a stack of papers):”Give it another half hour”. 
  
me (getting distracted by something):”Didn’t I see you scribbling on a Chinese take-out menu?”   
  
Will:”Huh. Yeah, I remember. Huh-huh. Beef Chow Fun. Fifty one”. 
  
Will gets up and starts rooting through a stack of CDs, inserts one and pushes Play.
  
I set the first Mac to x.x.x.51. It looks like it has network. Netscape gets me AltaVista.dec.com, so we’re good.  
Stereo:”The prison system, inherently unjust and inhumane
Is the ultimate expression of injustice
and inhumanity in the society at large.” 

I unplug the monitor and keyboard from my first Mac to the other one. 
  
  
 
Stereo:”Those of us on the outside do not like
to think of wardens and guards as our surrogates, yet they are.
And they are intimately locked in a deadly embrace
with their human captives behind prison walls.
By extension, so are we.
The terrible double meaning is thus imparted
to the original question of human ethics
""Am I my brother's keeper?”  
  
I set the IP to x.x.x.52. No dice. I change it to x.x.x.50 and I’m good. I start Timbuku (a early Mac VNC/RDP work-alike) and am able to login to the other Mac.  
  
Stereo:”The second of February, 1980
Began three days of misery
A scene of retaliation
Epitomizing violence, horror, and vindication
Thieves, murderers, and rapists
Inundated their prison like homicidal sadists
Guards and convicts alike would pay the price”. 
  
DNS is still wacky. I’m afraid to ask Will how that mess is configured and the music is starting to annoy me, which is odd, since I’m a fan of Exodus.   
  
It must be that I’m overtired and the walls are gently breathing.
  

 
  

  

  
  
  
I’m realizing three things:  
  
  
1. Will’s approach to system management is haphazard at best. 
  
2. That wasn’t a mild amphetamine.   
  
3. I have perhaps 30 minutes to finish debugging DNS before things get more difficult than they already have been.   
  
I pack up my stuff, grunt a good-bye to Will and make a beeline home. It’d be better to do this alone, in a quiet dark room.

As you can now guess. there is the login screen, I ask the exec to log in and all is working.  He got really quiet and thanked me and I left. Now I do not fault the exec for this oversight. new equipment and unfamiliar is ok. But I still could only laugh about it when I reached the lab room.

t3_c72imt,When God doesn't want you to have sevice,"If you have lived in the Raleigh area in the last 3 years, you'll be able to confirm this. It happened on March 16th, 2017.

I'm an Enterprise fiber guy.  I got a call from a customer looking for information on an existing ticket. I'm thinking no problem. I pull it up and see that it's been 4 days since it's been opened which is not good at all. I start reading through the ticket and it says the following, line for line:

""Fiber has been cut inside the building. Access not possible at this time due to after hours.""

""Building is in hazard condition due to fire. Unable to access until cleared by fire marshall.""

""Crane from nearby construction site has fell on site. ETR 1 weeks pending access.""

""Building is now flooded due to heavy rain in area. Warehouse advised of pending CPE replacement. Construction ETR 3 weeks pending access.""

My gut drops because I'm thinking, ""There is NO WAY IN HEAVEN OR HELL he's going to believe this."" I read them word for word and he says, ""Oh. That was our building. I saw the news but wasn't sure. Alright. Nothing we can do. We'll have to start ordering new equipment for our side of the network, as well. Thanks.""

t3_c735fs,One of my top 10 WTF moments,"Back when I worked business and residential with a certain provider, I had a lady call in because her service wasn't working. I verified the account and proceeded to troubleshoot as normal. Her modem was not responding whatsoever. I wanted to send a tech but she wanted me to fix it over the phone. So I continued to try and work with her. I even tried a forceful config push in case is was a modem that wasn't responding back but was still receiving the signal. No go. After about 20 min of troubleshooting, I relented and told her I'd have to send a tech to her house to investigate the modem. She says, ""I'm not at my house so you can't send him there."" I respond, ""Huh??"" She says, ""I'm at my sister's house."" She was THREE STATES AWAY! I explain to her that her modem won't work there and she proceeds to flip out, yelling and screaming at me and demanding a good reason why the service she pays for won't work three states over. Considering the fact that she thought that this would work to begin with, I'm not about to explain it any more detailed than ""service is only being provided to the place where you asked for it to be installed at at the time of installation"". She demands to speak to a supervisor. I transfer to a supervisor and keep taking calls. I ended up having to write a report on the issue because it ended up going to a director because no one could believe what was actually happening and some people thought I refused to help her because this was way too farfetched for people to believe.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c7311k,Turn off your phone.,"A very short story.

So this happened about 8-10 years ago. The iPhone 4 had just come out. I was working phone support and hawking Uverse for AT&amp;T Customers. In short, my job was to be nice to people who'd been screwed over by AT&amp;T and then sell them stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't recall the details of what his issue was but it was fixed by him simply rebooting his phone every X days. I think he had an iPhone 2 and had literally never turned it off. The guy had called in every so often (not a regular basis) with the same issue and been told the same thing by everyone he spoke to. He did not call in from the device so troubleshooting was easy with the exception that he absolutely refused to turn off his phone. I asked him why and he replied that he was afraid he would miss a call. 

&amp;#x200B;

True story.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c6y94z,Your call would be important if you called the right people...,"So a little back story - I used to work for a call service outsourcing company that worked for a number of Internet Service Providers, one of which was a household name in the UK, and the others were ISP arms of well known UK brands.

Because we were dealing with customers of multiple companies, and I didn't always know who the caller was a customer of straight away, I had to open all my calls with a generic phrase. I used: 

""Hello, you're through to customer service and technical support, my name is **** I'll be doing my best to help you today, can I take your username please?""

One day, among my many calls, I get a call from a very polite and calm sounding man, who was I guessed somewhere in his mid 30s-mid 40s from how he souned on the line.

I opened with my standard line, and he gave me his username, no problem. I then asked for his password, which he didn't know. Not to worry, since there's a bunch of other security questions. I began with ones linked to address and phone number, but he didn't know his landline number (an increasingly common problem). Nor did he have a security question.

This took a while, and I needed to ask him several other questions, but he always seemed to not have the specific information that would get him through data protection. It ended up being the case that he needed to provide details of the card he used to arrange his direct debit that paid for his internet every month. 

Finally, we got through security, and I then went to my next standard line.

""That's all done now sir, how can I help you today.""

And then, without skipping a beat... without even the slightest hesitation of any kind, the man goes...

""I'd like a bus pass please""

????
????
????

I was baffled. My initial thought was there some kind of deal we were doing with a coach company or some other transportation side offer. I even checked with my manager because this was so out of left field. 

In the end, the man said that he must have pressed redial or dialled a different number or something, and went on his way.

I was baffled! Questions running through my head include
- Why does the bus company think you have a ""Username""?
- Why does the bus company have your credit card details? (A bus pass in the UK would only be a local goverment one time purchase)
- Why did you not notice on the waiting time before the call all the times when the name of the company was mentioned as you called in ""Thank you for calling BRAND"" etc...


EDIT 

Okay, you all seem hooked on the password detail for some reason. So here's how it works.

The system presented two text input boxes, with numbers above. The numbers represented which charachter of the password it is. I say down the phone ""Can I have the Xth and Yth charachters of your password"" type them in, and then it either says green or red.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c766qt,Customer was responsible for their own problems,"As always, let me mention that I'm an Enterprise fiber guy. I had a customer call in stating that his internet was down again. He was pissed because he said it went down weekly since they got it two months ago. Of the 7 weeks it went down, only two situations fell on us slightly: one was a dump truck driving with its back up and the other was a core router issue where the firmware upgrade didn't take properly. The other times were their own router losing its configuration or not allowing access or them over utilizing the circuit. I ask him to verify power and give me info on the equipment. He says,  ""I'm rebooting this once! If it's not up in two minutes, a tech better be here in 30!!"" I tell him he'll be charged if the tech finds he was unneeded or that the site had caused damage.  He cursed at me and then demanded a supervisor. I set up the dispatch and notated the possible dispatch charge. Then I got him to a lead.  The lead got an earful. After the call, the lead came over and told me that the guy was a dick. 

The tech got out there in an hour, since he was nearby. He shot the fiber with an OTDR and called for fiber repair to fix the broken fiber. An hour later,  email with the RFO comes in:

Fiber fully repaired. Cause of break: customer has third party doing renovations which broke fiber off of the CPE.

I tried SO hard to reach that customer but he refused to answer. He still got charged for the dispatch and got marked as ineligible for any adjustments to future bills because of hope he talked to the tech.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_c70vz0,Did you not learn the same things I did?,"This story, unlike many here, takes place at a technical college between two students. Because the other person involved is supposed to know what they’re doing I feel it is even more depressing 

StoneCold=Me
L=Other dude

So we’re two weeks away from completing the A+ portion of the course. We’ve covered everything except printer maintenance and some basic networking.  At this point everyone should know the basics of fixing and maintaining a computer. Well not L. 

L has a laptop that he BSOD somehow and needs it fixed. Okay, all you need to do is order a $12 recovery USB and follow the steps, NO BIG DEAL MY DUDE. 

L:”I don’t want to spend the money though”

Me: “Alright, I’ve got a Win 7 Recovery/Install disc and we can just reupgrade your system afterwards.  It’s gonna wipe your hard drive though because you’re running Win10”

L:” Okay, you bring the disc and we’ll do it”

At this point I’m wondering why “we” need to do anything, but maybe it’s just how he talks. 

The fated day comes and I confirm with him he knows this will wipe his system. He agrees to it. I pop the disc in and walk away to continue my studies. 

30 seconds later

L:” StoneCold, what do I do here?”

So I walk over. 

Me:”You hit the Install button”

I walk back to my desk and have barely reattached my ESD strap when

L:”StoneCold, what do I do now?”

So I go back over

Me:” You just, you select what version of Windows you want”

L:” What version should I get?”

Really dude, you’re asking me what version of Windows to put on your laptop after nearly 3 months of being in a computer class?!

Me:”Fuck it, Win 7 Enterprise it is”

So I go back to reassembling, troubleshooting, and fixing the desktop at my workbench. 

Another minute goes by

L:” StoneCold, what now?”

So I walk back over 

Me:”You click next. That’s all you have to do for the next few minutes”

Long story short, this continues for EVERY. SINGLE. THING. I have to keep walking over and babysitting someone who should be capable of a basic install while having my own work ignored because this idiot apparently can’t click next. 

L:” StoneCold, it froze up, what do I do now?”
Me: Looks at screen “The install is initializing, see that little thing moving?”
L:”Oh I see now”

This continues and we have a clean install. 

At this point I’ve already told him how to reinstall 10 for free on his machine and that all he has to do is search “Windows 10 upgrade free” on his phone and all the steps will be right there. I feel I am finally free. 

L:”How do I get the 10 back?”
Me:” Just, just hand me the laptop”

So he does and I plug in the Ethernet and begin the Windows 10 download while following all the instructions on the very first result of that search.

t3_c71ytj,Brother studied IT but can't cable a basic computer,"My first post...so sorry of it's long or rambling or for any other mistakes, English is my second language and I'm all the way from Africa.

TL;DR Fixed my brother's mistake and got rewarded 

Just some background on why the PC needed some cable management....My brother has finished his IT degree and is currently working as a technician at a local tech shop. He has a 5-6 year old  MSI gaming laptop but recently he's building a desktop. It's a few second hand parts that I gave him and a few parts he bought from a friend of mine. But here's the thing, he doesn't have a monitor so now the desktop is just sitting there...


So now to the reason it needed some cable management is because I used the power supply(it was my spare (side note: it only has 1 4pin for the cpu connector.  Important for later) to run my custom loop pump when I cleaned it the other day and seeing that he wasn't using it asked him if I could borrow the 16gb RAM as well and he said ""Sure"". So after getting my PC back up and running I put the power supply back in his tower and figured if he wants to use it at any point he'll ask for the RAM and that's when I'll reconnect the cables as well so I continue on with life.

Now like 3 days ago he lent the tower to a friend because he was having a bit of a tough time with his own. So the next day I get a message from him asking if I removed some of the cables to which I remind him about the cleaning. His reply was a mere ""Ok"". That afternoon he calls and asks me to go and take a look at it because the pc won't boot or show any sign of power after he plug everything back.

I get there and what do I find... a 6 pin PCI cable plugged into the 8 pin CPU connector, a slotted graphics card but no power connected and a real mess of wires hanging around. The first time he assembled it I held him with the cables and I have done some checking and so the I3 CPU didn't need the 8 pin so just the 4 was fine. I did tell him this and showed him as well.

So I quickly fix all the cables, tucked them away nicely and got the machine up and running after also reconnecting the the front ports and buttons cables because the were also mixed up. The guy then thanked me and gave me some biltong and 50Rand.",talesfromtechsupport

User: it has been reset and Manager had other user unplug it and plug it back in but it didn't fix it.

Me:  The computer has an uptime of 5hrs 48 minutes.......

Users Supervisor: Other User is shutting the computer down now.  She will let me know.

Other user:  I shut down the computer and logged back on and it still shows the error same as before.

&amp;#x200B;

Users Supervisor:   I'm on the phone with $*Generic Bank Support* now.

cue spongebob voice-over ""10 minutes later""

Users Supervisor:   The solution was to unplug the check scanner then plug it back in.  

&amp;#x200B;

Me:  ----Rage Face-----

&amp;#x200B;

My Boss:  (who was cc'd on all of these emails) For future reference ""restart the check scanner"" as mentioned in the initial response from PF means to unplug the power from the scanner and then plug the power back into the scanner.  Although it sometimes seems cliche to ""try turning it off and on again"", it is occasionally the proper corrective step in troubleshooting, especially when directed to do so by support staff; perhaps ultimately reducing the number of emails from 12 to 3 or less and freeing up some time and effort to perform other duties.   Or you could even try calling us and probably get it resolved in a fraction of the time it takes to write the initial email as we are usually here and usually answer the phone.

A call I received from one of our employees recently is certainly one of the dumbest I have ever had the displeasure to be on the other side of the line of.

Let me preface this by saying that in addition to multiple remote offices in multiple states, we employ users that travel to offsite client homes to do their work.  We provide them with tablets (that we manage for obvious reasons) and bluetooth keyboards to make typing a little easier.  I can remotely access any device in or outside of our offices at any time, including the tablets.

Me:  ""Okay, let's take a look.""

At this point I remotely connect to the tablet to see what the user sees.

Me:  ""Well, the keyboard is paired and connected to the tablet.  What is not working specifically?""

User:  ""Every time I type anything it puts what I type in the wrong place.""

Me:  ""So you are saying what you type in is going into a different field than where you intended.  Do I have that right?""

User:  ""YES.  This keyboard doesn't work right.""

Me:  ""Alright.  Do me a favor and turn off that keyboard for a moment, give it a few seconds and turn it back on.""

Honestly, I really just assumed this user was tapping some field by mistake.  Fat-fingering it you could say, so I was just humoring her by telling her to turn the keyboard on and off.

User:  ""Okay, I need to go get the keyboard from the other room.  I leave it in there.""

Me:  ""Wait........so where is the tablet when you are using the keyboard?""

User:  ""I just told you.  I leave it in a different room.""

Me:  ""So you are saying you leave the tablet in one room and type on the keyboard from another?  How do you see what you are typing?""

User:  ""I watch my fingers.""

Me:  ""Ummmmmm.....I....I don't....You need to keep the keyboard with the tablet IN THE SAME ROOM, WHERE YOU CAN SEE WHAT YOU TYPE ON THE SCREEN.  Not watch your fingers and hope for the best.""

t3_c6njp2,Delicious Whiffies™,"$Me: me (customary pointless explanation)

$Customer: lady in car

$CM: crew member


Despite now working in product management, my first ever job was at a popular fast food place. We had all sorts of joy with the drive thru headsets when they were first introduced but it was mostly fine and nothing TFTS-worthy.

After my first few months I'd overcome my shyness and perfected my customer service persona, gained the knowledge that the more polite you are, the quicker angry people (tend to) calm down, which was setting me up for my future career.

One busy Saturday on the drive thru, I was on the window where you hand out the food and drinks. There was usually at any given time at least three cars in the queue, which was manageable. I hand an order out to a woman, give her my best ""have a lovely day"", and begin to sort out the drinks for the car behind when all of a sudden I hear:


$Customer: WHERE'S MY WHIFFY?!

$Me: I beg your pardon?

$Customer: I WANT MY WHIFFY!

$Me: My apologies, but I'm not sure what you're referring to? Do you mean an ice cream? 


(Side note - it's not uncommon in England for an ice cream cone to be referred to as a ""whippy"" - but rarely are they given without payment in response to such a rude tone.)


$Customer: IT'S A WHIFFY! YOUR SIGN SAYS I GET A FREE WHIFFY!

$Me: Do you mean the sign on this window? I'm afraid it's a decal and I can't see what it says from the inside. I'm not aware of any special offers but I'll check with a colleague.

$Customer: I'M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT MY WHIFFY


I gladly walk away from the window and ask if anyone knows if we have an offer on whiffies, and what a whiffy even was. Everyone was clueless, and also wanted to know about the shouty woman. #CM offers to run around the drive thru to check what was showing on the window, which I gladly accept as the cars were piling up and it was hot out.

Returning to the window, I wait for #CM checking to come around.


$CM: It says 'free WiFi'

$Me: Ohhh, of course!

$Customer: WHERE'S MY WHIFFY?!

$Me: The sign is referring to WiFi. This means if you eat in the restaurant, you can take advantage of the internet while you're here.

$Customer: I DON'T WANT THAT, WHAT CAN I HAVE INSTEAD?

$Me: Nothing, you can't trade it? It's not food?


$Customer just swears and swerves off out of the drive thru. This was apparently a massive injustice.

I realise this wasn't traditional TFTS but every time an issue takes three times as long because someone is calling something the completely wrong thing, I think of ol' Whiffy.

t3_c6kqhz,“I thought you guys were busy” - A Cautionary Tale,"I worked for a fairly popular law firm years ago as the Tech Support Specialist (my actual title). The firm had about 100 users consisting primarily of lawyers and their secretaries. Being in the legal sector, we pretty much gave assistance to whatever issue the users had immediately. Didn’t matter if you called, emailed, texted, smoke signalled, carrier pidgeoned, whatever; we were ready to fix problems right when they happened, and we were on call too. 

The secretaries did a ton of important legal document processing and the sort. Because of the highly sensitive nature of what they handled, they were all required to save their work on one of our several network shares, not on their local hard drive. Some did save certain things locally that were usually not critical or anything, but we always told them that our network shares were backed up regularly, but not their laptops (prohibitively expensive).

Enter the crashed hard drive.

Phone call comes in

Secretary: Hey, tech support?! Uhmm…. Yeah. My computer isn’t booting up and I hear some weird clicking noise. 

Me: The clicking noise is coming from the laptop? 

S: Yes!

I go to investigate and informed her that the hard drive has failed and needs replacement. She asked if I can get the data off of her hard drive; I figured she probably had some pictures or music saved and didn’t want to lose it. Turns out the hard drive wasn’t readable in the slightest. 

The plot thickens.

M: Hey. Just letting you know that we tried to get the data off and couldn’t do it. The drive is unreadable.

S: But I have 2 weeks worth of work saved on it! I have a document I need done tomorrow!!!

M: All that stuff should be on the network shares. You can access it on another machine.

S: I saved it in My Documents. You mean there?

M: No. That’s locally on your hard drive. I mean the network shares on our servers where we all store everything. 

S: Oh, that shortcut had a red X on it and wasn’t working, so I just saved it in My Documents.

M: …..when did it start that?

S: Oh sometime last month. I thought you guys were really busy and didn’t want to make it a big deal. 

M: …..

Explaining this to her boss was not a fun time, especially the part about costing $500+ to send the drive to a data lab with no guarantee of data recovery. If I recall correctly, she ultimately ended up leaving the company a short time later. 

To put it all in to perspective, I offer these bits of knowledge:

	1. Backups. Backups. Backups.
	2. If we don’t KNOW the problem, we can’t FIX the problem.
	3. Not everything that fails can be resurrected.

Our customers have interfaces with third parties where, normally, HL7 files would drop into a folder on the customer's server. Our software would process the file. And the data would end up in a patient's chart. Note: We support the healthcare software. NOT the customer's network.

&amp;#x200B;

The case that came in describes their situation this way:  
We had an issue where data was not going into patients charts from a specific third party. Other third parties processed fine. After speaking to this third party, we found that they were sending data to our old server's IP. That server had been shut down. Once that server was started back up, we started seeing data from them in the patient's charts once again. We believe there is a service that is sending data from the old server to the new server to be processed. We are confused as to how data is moving from the old server to the new server and are requesting guidance and support on how this data is moving.  


Call me crazy, but I'm wondering why their first instinct isn't to ask the third party to start sending to the new server.",talesfromtechsupport

It's 1995, I'm a broke college student and I'm starting an ISP with an unscrupulous and cheap businessman. What could go wrong?
  
I get Ivan to agree to a budget of around $3,000. This will buy two used Macs and all the RAM and hard drives I can shove into the cases. I install web, mail, FTP and FileMaker (all with, erm, borrowed licenses). A little bit of testing in Ivan's office confirms that, well, Mac OS 7.5 isn't exactly _stable_ so I install two Rebound! automagic rebooters. They exploit a quirk of the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), the proprietary keyboard and mouse connector that eventually was replaced with USB in the iMac a few years later.  
  
In ADB, the Mac regularly queries the keyboard and mouse. If the OS freezes, this process stops. The Rebound! listens for the queries and if they stop for a few seconds, it sends the Control, Command, Power three finger salute to reboot the system.  
  
It's a kluge but it will keep my webserver running without much human intervention.  
  
Now, all I need is cheap and fast Internet. I'm planning on doing something with my college friend Will. Will works part time as a network engineer for my school. He's not very diligent nor well paid, but he is crafty.  
  
Last year, he ran ethernet from an adjacent college building to his second floor apartment, giving him the fastest residential Internet available. He soon used stolen network gear to support a dozen servers which kept his apartment toasty in the winter.   
  
Later, a roommate moved out and he moved all the servers into the vacant bedroom and he started charging for the service. I got him through Economics 1001 so he could keep his scholarship, so he should be amenable to a discount on pricing.
  
I pack up some clothes and drive back to the city. I get to my apartment in the city around 8pm. Markus, my rich kid stoner roommate has parked his truck blocking the one remaining parking spot and the back door to our building. I've got to park a few blocks away while carrying two full size towers to the apartment, then walk up to the fourth floor.

Markus:""No- the foundation was poured incorrectly. Since they built it, they're buying it back from him. They'll sit on it until the real estate goes up in value, then knock it down""  
  
me:""So it'll just be an eyesore in the suburbs for a while?""  
  
Markus:""Worse. Dad just locked up one day, gave the crew other jobs and turned off the water and power at the end of a shift""  
  
me:""That's even more unpleasant. Remind me to never go in there. Could you help me schlep these towers over to Will's? I'll buy you a six-pack at the packy""  
  
Markus:""Sure""  
  
On the several block walk to Will's apartment/low rent colocation facility, Markus and I make the executive decision to buy beer on the way. It's sweltering in the city.  
  
I have to lean on the buzzer for a minute or two to get Will to sullenly open the door and let us in. He does seem to appreciate being handed a cold beer for the climb back up the stairs to his apartment.  
  
If it was hot outside, it's not too bad inside Will's apartment. Will has supplemented the anemic central air with window air-conditioners. There are PCs everywhere, some open and partially disassembled, some running. Some are on the floor, others are shoved into pressboard bookshelves leaning against the weight. This place would make a fire marshal or OSHA spit blood.  
  
Will's roommate, Kevin, takes one look at my two Mac towers, open beers and decides that it's time to take a stand.   
  
Kevin:""No. No more shit. Get out""  
  
I turn to Will.   
  
me:""Hey, I'll pay you. Cash. Every month.""  
  
Kevin:""NO!""  
  
Will:""No, man. Just can't do any more""  
  
me (turning to Kevin):""What if I could organize all this so that it's neat, clean and safe?""   
  
Markus:""Ha!""    
  
me:""I'll put all this gear in proper shelves, get it back in the spare room, and pay you $75 a month. You won't even have to admin these things""  
  
Will looks around, shrugs his shoulders and nods.  
  
I find a relatively clean and clear corner and start looking for power and ethernet to plug into my two Macs.   
  
Kevin:""No. You clean all this up and _then_ you can set up""  
  
me:""Fine. I'm going to Micro Center and getting some stuff. I'll be back in a bit and I'll get started""  
  
I walk out, with Markus following with an amused look on his face.  
  
On the way back to the liquor store, I put together my plan.  
  
me:""Markus, do you have the keys to your Dad's Burger King and can I borrow your truck for a few hours?""",talesfromtechsupport

t3_c6m4s6,A Positive HD Recovery Story,"This happened a few months back.

My sister works for a law firm as a paralegal(or something that helps research for cases). She calls me up  while out of town one evening around 9pm, and was freaking out because they had a major case the next morning, and the lawyer's MacBook crashed. 

They used an external drive to save all data related to cases, so thankfully they still had that available. Unfortunately, due to the hour, the lawyer was only able to get a Windows laptop which, of course, uses a different file system and won't play nice with the backup on the external drive.

Enter the call to me. I remote in, do the needful, save the files and finish around 11pm(there were a lot of files).

They won the case(I don't know if that is good or evil in this case), and a week later I get a decent visa gift card in the mail from her boss. I didn't ask for anything, just like helping out and enjoyed a challenge as I hadn't dealt with that specific type of issue yet.

This was a slightly odd tale that started at around 10 this morning. I forwarded my boss an e-mail.

He didn't receive it.

I copied the contents into a new e-mail and sent that, just in case it was the forwarding that had gone wrong.

He didn't get that either.

I sent him a blank e-mail.

Guess what...

During this time I was sending e-mails to others and they were receiving them.

Kevin (my boss - the name should have warned me) was receiving e-mails from others.

I sent e-mails to internal and external addresses and they were going through fine. His e-mails were coming to me.

At this point I was a bit stumped so I contacted my favourite people, tech support.

All the normal questions were asked including whether there were any attachments on the e-mails (there weren't) but whilst I was e-mailing back and forth I replied to an e-mail from my boss with some further information that needed to go to the original recipient.

He got that.

Some of you may already know where this is heading but it took me until this point to have a bit of a brainwave...

I looked at his computer and checked his rules. He had one set up to put e-mails from me directly into a folder, which we already knew about, but I decided to have a scan through the rest of the rules.

The problem was solved when I checked rule ""only to me (2)""

Somehow he had set up a rule to put all of the e-mails that were sent only to him into a sub-sub-folder...

""only to me"" and ""only to me (1)"" had other clauses that stopped them from sweeping up all mail but this one didn't.

He swears he has no idea how he managed to set it up.

He is currently replying to several e-mails that he hadn't seen.

The best part is that I sent an e-mail to the tech support agent saying ""Solved, he had set up a rule to move e-mails sent only to him into a separate folder so that's where they were. He's a numpty"" and the agent pasted this into the ticket as the solution. I'm very glad I changed the original description to numpty from ""f\*\*king idiot""",talesfromtechsupport

t3_c6c7u7,"""can you really not fix it?"" ""well I can see if I have some magic fairy dust on my bag.""","So this story relates to a former company I was with. At the time, I was the local Jack of all trades for the company and on two days of the week I was acting as the personal assistant for the Electrician. I'm quite savvy with computers, but have never had an formal education in it. Still I'm the closest thing they have as onsite tech support. Usually I have to deal with problems of the printer or whatever not working. What is a 2 minute fix is like super hacker wizardry to everyone else on site.

&amp;#x200B;

When I come in one morning after having been offsite on a day of playing PA to the Electrician, the onsite boss calls me onto her office, let us call her Eve. Eve tells me that one of the computers, a more powerful desktop unit then all the laptops we have, won't turn on anymore and if I can have a look at it.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure I can so I do. Press the power button, nothing. of course I make sure its plugged in, which it is. and I press the power button again. still nothing. Knowing that people like to slam that button to turn the machine on or off. I think that someone may have damaged the power button so on a hunch I open up the side panel to jumper the two power on pins. still nothing. Seeing that there was a really bad storm the night prior, I'm suspecting that its a lightning strike that fried the machine. so whatever damage it received, we'd be looking at getting replacement parts for it when I figure out which parts are bad and which are good. No way for me to test that without my testing equipment which I own and keep at home. so I go back to Eve and the conversation goes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey Eve? I had a look at that machine""""Oh really OP? did you fix it?""""I didn't. On the windows side, I can do a lot. sadly, the computer doesn't even turn on so its an issue with the physical components inside the computer. I managed to rule out the power button but other then that, I can't tell without my testing equipment.""

""Any idea what caused the problem?""

""Likely a lightning strike during the storm that happened last night.""

""Oh... whats it going to take to fix it?""

""Likely some new components, but again, I currently can't tell which component inside the machine is broken. it might be the power supply, or the main board. but I have no way of knowing that right now.""

""Well can't you just try a new power supply or a 'main board' as you called it?""

""Do we have a little under 500 Euro's in the budget to spend on that Eve?""

""Well no, that's too expensive.""

""Agreed, and this old machine isn't worth it either"" the machine is over 10 years old.

""So you really can't fix it?""

""Not right now, no.""

""Really? OP you are so good with computers, are you absolutely sure you can't do anything?""

""like I said Eve, this hardware issue isn't an easy fix.""

""C'mon OP, even you must have a trick to get it working again, can you really not fix it?""

At this point I get annoyed because woman I told the issue and that I couldn't fix it right this second. and I hate having repeat myself so I fire off the first thing that comes to mind.

""Well I can see if I have some magic fairy dust in my bag, but I think we'll be shit out of luck.""

Eve takes a bit to process that, looking at me blankly as she wraps her head around my sarcasm. ""what kind of a reaction is that?""

""The one I give to people asking me pull a magic trick out of my butt. its broken, I can't fix it without the proper tools and replacement parts.""

""Ok OP, I'll discuss this with my boss to maybe get a new machine, thank you.""

They ended up replaced the machine after about a week or so.

t3_c64djd,When Client's IT team is on your side," 

Long time reader first time poster. Nice to see everybody.

So  this would've started back in November of 2018, I had just started a  job at #learningsoftwarecompany that September, and was relatively new  to everything but was starting to get hold of my position. **#Learningsoftwarecompany** (which I will refer to as **#LSC**  from here on) sold both courses and platforms for several client  companies to assign to their employees for on-boarding training, legal  compliance, extra curricular training, and basic ""how to""s on anything  from AWS to Facebook.

It should also be mentioned that as **#LSC**  had clients both in the fortune 500 and the fortune 100 market, we are a  pretty large company, with a few child companies we had bought of the  years for various reasons, the important of which for this story is one  company we bought out based in France, we'll call this **FrenchLearningSoftwareCompany** (**#FLSC**)

I  had been hired on this job as one of our Language Support Tier 1  representatives, since growing up on the East Coast of Canada and  working several government jobs before this, I was fluent in both French  and English. Up until November our team at the Customer Support Centre  only handled password resets and the such for **#FLSC**, anything more then that would be sent to a team of three engineers in **#FLSC's** headquarters.

Early  November our Customer Support Manager (#Man) called both myself and the  other French Tier 1 into the VPs office for meeting (Being the newbie I  was confused to say the least). We were informed that we would be  taking over most of the integration work for **#FLSC**  as they were now without their team of three engineers, wherein 1 of  them quit, one of them went on educational leave, and one of them had  been let go recently. Part of his reason was it was so urgent we took  his work over was because he had done virtually nothing since August.  There also was a back log of cases to deal with.

One of these cases was more long winded then others. The Client (**#Client M**) accessed **#FLSC's**  courses through their own Third Party Platform (TPLMS, Third Party  Learning Management System). This is a very common occurrence in our  company, but when clicking on the link on their TPLMS, they were brought  to our page but asked for a direct login to **#FLSC** site, which of course they would not have as they are intended to be redirected seamlessly.

Early December the HR director (**#Catbert**) for **#Client M**  emailed us complaining that the issue had not been fixed for a month  and that she was furious and was going to sue for compensation. Rather  harsh, but given the situation I didn't entirely blame her for her  malcontent. We had been working through several cases like this  including her own, and I was used to this by now. At this point a  apologized for the wait and setup a call and screenshare meeting with  their head of IT (**#Dilbert**). **#Dilbert**  and I had our call, gathered some information, discussed it with our  Tier 3 team and came to a solution. The issue ended being due to a  cookies policy used by the client's Network on IE 11. We let **#Dilbert** know what to do to fix the issue, and asked that he call us back if it did not work.

2 weeks pass, and **#Catbert** emails again, with her Sales Rep copied, as well as **#Dilbert**. **#Catbert**  is furious, as apparently the issue is still happening and nothing has  been fixed. We immediately reply mentioning we were waiting on a reply  from **#Dilbert** to see if the fix we had given them had worked.

Not long after **#Dilbert** also replies on the email chain, mentioning that as far as he was concerned the issue was fixed, and for **#Catbert** to make sure they speak to him before reporting an issue to **#FLSC** (+1 for #Dilbert). I set up another call with **#Dilbert**, as it turned out this was a separate issue that **#Dilbert** and I solved right there own the phone.

Skip to 3 weeks later. **#Catbert** is emailing again, and to put a translation of what she said:

*""Thank you for letting us know how you will be compensating us for the lack of service"".*

**#Catbert** had provided a screenshot from a end user, however before I could even touch it another email comes in on the same chain from **#Dilbert**, addressing **#Catbert**. **#Dilbert**  mentions that he is not replicating this problem from within their  network, and judging from the screenshot this was a browser cache issue.

**#Dilbert** advises **#Catbert**  again that she should be going through him first before sending harsh  emails to us, as he is perfectly capable of handling a caching issue  himself. Slightly difficult to translate the tone to English but he was  essentially telling her off. That was the last of that cases issue.

A couple weeks later we received confirmation from **#Dilbert** that everything was working as expected. I like **#Dilbert**.

I was setting up a user who just moved into a new position where I work, and I set her up with the laptop of the former staff member she was replacing.

&gt;$T: It works on my keyboard, but it won't reach where the dock is.

&gt;$Me: I'll come over with an extension cable for it. Sometimes those monitors have flaky USB ports, or they're too low-powered to power a keyboard/mouse consistently.

I get over to her office to see the USB-B end of the cable plugged into the ethernet port of the dock. The only reason the ethernet wasn't plugged in was because it wasn't working when I plugged in a cable, but it works directly connected to the laptop (I'm working on getting a replacement through warranty). I move it and let her know that it wasn't working because it was not plugged in correctly. I showed her where to plug it in on the monitor, and then the keyboard started working.

t3_c665yj,My keyboard isn't working right!,"So, this story dates back just over a decade when I started working for my current employer. I work for a bank and the building I worked in housed a large Credit Department that took up 3 floors of the building. We would constantly get requests to set up new hires with a PC, Dual Screens, Phone, etc. One day this request comes in to set someone up starting the following week. I drop off the PC on Friday, log in with the user's ID and Temp password to set up her applications. Monday rolls around and the user's manager calls me to stop by and help the user sign in and show the basics of the system. I go down and meet the user, I ask her to have a seat and sign in. She sits down, and just stares at the keyboard. After a minute I say ""you can log in now, here is your User ID and password"". She just stares at the keyboard again and says ""I haven't worked with a system like this before, It will take me a minute to sign in"" she says as she proceeds to hunt-and-peck with one finger as she signs into the desktop. Eventually she gets in and I show her how to open email, internet, print, etc. It was the longest anyone had taken to get into everything.

Fast Forward to the end of the week. I get a ticket for said user, stating that her keyboard isn't working right. I call and ask what is going on. She tells me ""Well, when I press A, the letter Q comes up, when I press B, W comes up."" It didn't hit me until I got to her desk, that she had popped off EVERY KEY from her keyboard, and put them in Alphabetical order and expected the new keyboard to work based on placing the keys alphabetically. It Didn't. I explained how a QWERTY keyboard works, and told her I would be getting her a replacement.

I informed her Operations supervisor and showed her the keyboard. Supervisor sent her for keyboard (typing) training.  Lady didn't last very long in that job.

t3_c64zht,Resetting my password - I've always done it this way,"So, I've been listening to rSlash on youtube for awhile now and your posts have inspired me to tell one of my more funny (omg really?) stories.

At the time I was working on a staff facing IT support helpdesk for a University. Our most common call are to either ""Unlock my account"" due to the user entering their password incorrectly more than 3 times in a row, or ""My password won't change"" usually due to our strict password policy which requires users to change their password to something different every month. 

This story relates to the latter. The lady in question calls up as Windows has reminded her that her password will expire within 1 day, she has hit ctrl-alt-del and then ""change password"" (Was windows 7 at the time). She says that she's having trouble changing her password and she has ""No idea what she is doing wrong"" so far, pretty normal conversation. I ask her what she sees on her screen or if any error message is shown and she says ""No it just doesn't change"" I'm starting to think, ah that's is pretty odd, so. ask her if it's ok if i can remotely access her computer, so i can see what she's seeing. 

Once i'm on her computer I'm displayed with the password change screen with none of the fields filled out, which is perfectly fine. Now there are 3 fields you need to fill to change your password. 1 is your current password (sometimes pre-populated) and next is ""your new password"" and then the next is ""confirm your new password"". The conversion goes as follows. I'm Me, the lady is well... lady. 

Me: Ok, just so i can see what's happening, would you mind typing this form out again. 

Lady: \*sighs heavily\* ""fine"".

She enters her current password and then almost immediately after that i hear a distinctive thump on the keyboard as she presses ""ENTER"". as an error message is displayed on her screen.

Me: Sorry, but did you press enter after you typed in your current password?

Lady: Yes \*sighing again\*.

Me: Ah, I'm sorry, but it doesn't work like that, you have to fill out the other fields before you press enter.

Lady: Ok fine, but can we hurry, up, i'm busy.

I click away the OK error message for her and she has to type in her old password again. She finishes again and wouldn't you know it, hits enter automatically again.

Lady: SEE IT WON'T work.

Me: You pressed enter again, you need to fill out the other fields. Here, this time, don't press anything after you type in your password. 

Lady: FINE, but i've NEVER had to do it like this before. 

I click the error message away for her again and i explain to her that we need to fill in the new password fields. She says

Lady: YES I KNOW THAT I@VE DONE THIS BEFORE. 

I remind her again to stop at the end of her password and not to press ANYTHING. 

She proceed to type of her old password and then stops (Great i think to myself) I then say:

Me: Now take your mouse and click into the ""new password field"".

She does this.

Me: Right now type in your new password

I also remind her of our password requirements so she doesn't get an error message again if her passwords match etc. 

She starts typing her new password and once shes at the end BOOM"" she hits enter!!!! Now, i'm finding this a little bit funny at this point as she's getting really frustrated. I say to her.

Me: No, you have to also confirm your password, you can't press enter yet. 

Lady: Oh, i've never had to do this before, this is far to complex. I need to get back to work I'll do it tomorrow.

I'm thinking to myself, ok but... you're going to have to go through the same thing tomorrow lol.

Visit EU and groan inside my head, the actual toner is black. I called the EU over “Hi, when you gives us a call, just check the display and it say what is needed”

EU “ Yeah but it’s fine, I mean it’s kinda like Aqua-Marine”

And so I go back and then come back with the right one to overhear the EU “I cannot do any printing because of the dumb IT tech cannot read”

As she spoke, in the background I could hear an odd ""donk"" noise when she would try to move the mouse.   I asked her what the sound what coming from.  ""Well, that's just the noise it makes when I put the mouse to the screen.  Am I doing it too hard?""

t3_c5rbyr,The literal job I was hired for at my university is pressing the ok button on the printer when it is “broken”.,"I get paid $12 an hour to sit at a desk in the library all day just so tech support doesn’t have to deal with non existent problems from students and staff. I call it the common sense desk because every question I get is DUMB. 

My primary interactions are...
Student or prof:  “the printer is broken” 

Me: *goes to printer* 

Printer: “confirm print job?”

Me: *presses ok*

Printer: *prints*


I also would like to note that there is a sign on the printer that says “press ‘ok’ to print”. 

I think it’s kind of hilarious and deeply sad that IT had to hire people for this position from 6 in the morning to 2am. But boy oh boy do I have an endless amount of tales.

Edit: the printer is automatic most of the time, but occasionally needs that little nudge with the ok button. That’s what really blows people’s minds and why I was hired. They can’t comprehend even looking at the printer to see why it won’t print.",talesfromtechsupport

Some phone models can be remotely provisioned, where the phone looks for settings from a known server on every boot and about once a day.  Some phones can't be, or just aren't supported on the new phone server to do so.  For those, I have to connect to the phone's web UI and put the proper server address and login in them.  I asked a site manager to get me the IP addresses for a couple phones that needed this, and he gave them to me.  I VPNd to the site, and...nothing.  Can't see the phones.  Can't ping them.  I connect to the old on-site phone system, it can't see the phones on the same LAN.

t3_c5q7lv,"""My Computer is Angry with Me!""","First time post here, but had this one in my repertoire for quite some time and figured I'd share.

&amp;#x200B;

So, years ago when I worked as tech support for a popular dial-up service in the early 2000's, I get this call from a kindly-sounding old lady who is trying to connect to the internet. However, her ""Computer gets very angry"" with her when she tries to connect. Umm. Ok? I try to help her out anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I begin with ""Let's go over your settings"", so I run down her setup checking the init string (a set of characters that determine settings for her modem). Maybe her dial-up modem was making weird sounds and freaked her out? Who knows. Then I get to her dial-in number to the service (which typically is a local number to the user, who happened to be in New York), and I check it against my list and realized it was off by a couple numbers. ""There, that should fix it right up."" I could have just ended the call, and asked her to call back if she had any other issues. But, curiosity gnawed at me, I had to know.

&amp;#x200B;

""Ma'am, I have to ask.. why did you think your computer was angry at you?"". ""Well"" she says, ""when I tried to connect, the computer gets quite angry, and very rude and calls me all sorts of names, like 'crazy b\*tch', and demands I stop calling. I'm just trying to connect to the internet to check my mail!"". It dawns on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many internal modems have a speaker, and tend to default to being on so you can hear the connection sounds. Hell, I got to the point I could diagnose their issue just by listening to it. So, this lady dials the wrong number in New York and this random guy, who probably is tired of his phone ringing over and over again, screams into the phone ""STOP calling me you f\*ing b\*tch!."" Which, of course, would travel right out of her computer case from her internal modem instead of the usual squeals and pops in response.

&amp;#x200B;

I mute for a moment to ponder my response, and compose myself. ""I see"", I managed to say without cracking my voice too much. ""well, your computer has likely forgiven you now, and you can go check your mail. Have a lovely evening, ma'am"". 

&amp;#x200B;

In retrospect, I don't know if this guy assume it was a woman calling him, or just calls everyone ""b\*itch"". ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Perhaps months of people getting that number wrong and squealing their computers in his ear has broke him.",talesfromtechsupport

Some backstory, I work for a software company that's pretty small potatoes but sells to the big guys. We have a separate team for volume support which is for corporations bigger than joe schmoe and consisted (at the time) of me and one other person who were not trained and just thrown into more complicated server related support for the floating licenses.

They're the kind that take 10 minutes to be convinced that they really do have to email in the information, it cannot be transferred over the phone, and we'll get back to them after we confer with our engineering team. Then they send over the info and immediately start calling over and over. Eventually I just have one of the QA dudes on a slack chat and send him the updates as soon as I get them, to stop playing this phone game.

Me: Okay, so it does appear as if this debug log is confirming that the server machine is able to access the ports needed for client communication and the web GUI, but is still unable to access the port needed for the ISV server. Again, this is dynamic and must be set to static if you require a specific port to be whitelisted.

SE: I told you we already opened the ISV server port!

Me: Again, if you chose a specific port we'll need to set this to static in the license file as rebooting the server will cause it to change.

SE: But I already fixed that part! Our company is losing money because you can't fix this!

Me: Since the server was rebooted, the port will be different. Can you tell me what port you chose to open so that I can set the license file to access the correct port?

SE: Whatever it was before, I don't remember! Can't you just set it to stick to the one the server is currently trying to use??

Me: We can, but then you'll need to change the rules in your network. It will likely be easier for you if we can set the license file to the port already open on your network.

SE: Hold on! I need to ask the network guy!

Me: \*on hold\* \*starts to notice people getting up to look out the windows\*

t3_c5x39j,Ineptitude of the Cabinet Office,"A bit of background,

I am an IT administrator for a software company that develops platforms for supply chain risk assessments, sustainability assessments, supply chain mapping, disaster alerts and cyber-security assessments.

We have an API for accessing this data of which we maintain older versions of it for backwards compatibility reasons, as such you have to tell it which version you want to use and obviously certain features are only available in certain versions.

This is all explained in our documentation.

End of background.

&amp;#x200B;

One day we got an email from the Cabinet Office complaining that our API wasn't working, so we investigated and found nothing wrong, we email back stating that we found no problems on our end but they were adamant that there was and that we must be blacklisting them... we weren't.

So, as any IT admin would do, we asked them for their IP address so we could check our logs, and (as expected) they were doing it wrong (wrong version number for the feature they wanted to use, v1 instead of v4), not only that but they only tried ONCE! before complaining!

We then emailed them back telling them this and their response was basically ""It works from the dev server so you must be blacklisting the new one"".

Confused by this we asked them for the IP of this dev server, checked the logs, and unsurprisingly, they were actually using the correct version on the dev server (v4).

again, we email back stating this and even attached the logs so they could see exactly what they were doing wrong, and yet they STILL insisted that it we must be blacklisting them.

It was after this point one of my colleagues took over the situation but they kept me on the loop on what was going on (glad they did because there's no way I would've had the patience or the nerves for it), they had to keep going back and forth trying to explain to them what they were doing wrong for a full week, they even ended up having to do a video conference to demonstrate to them that it works and all they had to do was change a 1 to a 4 (and that they were just being stupid), all despite the fact that **they already had this working on their dev server!**

And just to top it all off it turns out that they also developed the UI frontend before the API backend was even working! AND had developed the UI assuming that there would be data that we don't even collect!! so now they're going to have to throw away a large chunk of their code and rewrite it.

I would like to iterate that it is also clearly explained in our documentation exactly what data is available via our API...",talesfromtechsupport

t3_c5vw4p,"The ""destroyed"" Graphics Card","I am a german and i am not working in tech-support, yet i was for many years some form of tech-support guy for a lot of people. You know, general Problems like ""Why does windows not boot"", ""Why do i have bing instead of google"" and the typical ""my pc slows down, help me"" stuff. Never too serious.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a friend, lets call him'F' for Friend, that generally came to me when he bought hardware and let me put it into his pc, plug stuff in and all that. But enough of that, lets go to the story.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a couple years ago but i remember it as if it was yesterday. Roughly around 4pm afternoon my friend called me. It went something like that:  
F: ""Hey. My Graphic Card is slow""  
Me: ""What do you mean by 'slow'?""

F: ""I dont know, its just very slow. I cant play LoL with more than 20 fps or something like that. Can you come by?""

Me: ""Sure. I pack some stuff and change-hardware but if the card is damaged, put money aside to buy quickly a new one""

F: ""Okay, see you""

&amp;#x200B;

So, i prepared for the worst case scenario. I took everything i generally need. Windows Backup CD, DvD and USB-Stick, a Linux OS and lots of extra Hardware. You know, to test everything. Usually the problem is, most of the time, exact the first thing that's mentioned. But in case, its something else i usually test RAM as well - at least, the ram.

&amp;#x200B;

Took me roughly an hour to go to my friends place and i quickly began to interrogiate him: ""When did this happen? What did you do last? When did it still work fine? What have you installed? yadda yadda"". I started the usual stuff, tested the game(s) and sure enough, the fps where freaking boogus. At best you could get 26fps or something.

&amp;#x200B;

Strange, because i know that he bought the Card just a week or so ago. Maybe a ""monday""-hardware (We germans say that. Its like the 1 of a 100 items that comes out of production already damaged). So i go into bios and i see that his card is there, working fine. I do some tests, re-install drivers and stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

F: ""Should we go first to buy a new one?""

Me: ""I would say, yes. Its strange. Your card is there and working just fine. Let me just test it with my card that i brought""

&amp;#x200B;

So, before i do hardware-changes i usually tend to take at least half an hour to google for common problems and such. Check a few more settings to be very sure that there is no software or driver-problem. Nope, wasnt the case. So i sighed and thought i have to test the card i brought. I turned down the PC of my friend and started to unplug everything as i noticed something...

&amp;#x200B;

You know, usually, in most PC-Cases the Graphic Cards where pretty much in the middle or lowest plug. So i wonder why he used the most top dvi-plug and thought he must have changed the place of his card - but that would be strange - he must have bought another mainboard for that and i know he doesnt do hardware-work. So it began to dim.

&amp;#x200B;

I opened the case from the side and yup, the puzzle is now solved. My friend plugged his Monitor in the plug for the internal-graphics-card. I looked at him and started to laugh and he was puzzled to the extreme.

&amp;#x200B;

It took me roughly 10 Minutes and i was steadily pointing at the plug, wheezing and trying to say ""Look - you plugged it in wrong!"" but i couldnt bring out any form of wording, heck, not even phrasing a full sentence. Slowly he realized what has happened and just said

&amp;#x200B;

F: ""Thank you that you're not an butthole. You could've taken the graphics card for yourself and i would have bought a new one""

Me: ""Yep, could've done that. But make sure you plug it in right next time""

&amp;#x200B;

I showed him where he needed to plug it in, so he could do it alone in the future. Lets say, he is now much better wird Computers and we still laugh every now and then over the ""destroyed/defect graphics card"" :) I was compensated with food and drinks for the work-time. Its nearly as good as the very short story of me, asking a girlfriend of mine ""How big is your Screen?"" and she answered something like ""Well, roughly 40 centimeters wide and 30 centimeters high"" after we heard her rustling in the background, measuring her screen hehe.

I work for an MSP and one of our clients called in saying her computer was stuck in a boot loop. She'd get to the Windows logo on boot and the computer would immediately restart. This had been happening for 10-15 minutes and she needed to start work.

Now, an obvious problem is that if the computer won't boot we can't connect with our remote software and walking users through command line recovery is never fun. Fortunately it didn't come to this.

You see, this user knew enough that if the OS locked up, she could hold the power button to perform a hard shutdown, and this is exactly what had happened. However, she hadn't realized that eventually you need to let go of the power button. Yes, dear reader, she had been **holding the power button for almost 15 minutes.**

The computer would shut down, since she was holding the power button, start booting, but then hard shut down again. And again. And again.

&amp;#x200B;

Once we explained that she should let go of the power button once the PC turned off and then just press it once to start back up, all was right with the world. Windows booted up happily and our client was able to start her day.

""I was running up the stairs and I dropped the music player and it now won't turn on""

I roll my eyes. Are you fricking kidding me? The main thing in the warranty says it doesn't cover accidental damage, drops, etc. He continues as I listen to him.

""Now I know you guys don't cover accidental damage. But it wasn't my fault! It was an accident!"" 

I blinked. Did .. did this guy just say this?!?! The only thing I could say was ""Please hold.""

I put him on hold and I bust out laughing. Everyone in my department is looking at me and I explain exactly what was on the call. They all start laughing. I go to my manager and tell him the situation and he looks at me as if I have two heads and I follow up with.

""We can't cover this right?"" 

He shakes his head and was told to handle it with kid gloves and I nod and go back to my desk.

I get him back on the phone and I explain ""I am sorry sir, but the warranty states that it doesn't cover accidental damage."" 

Pause. ""Ok. Well thanks for your time."" Click.

God.. I question the intelligence of these users at times. But then again I read this subreddit and think.. yeah.. there are tons of dumb people out there. Anyway, thanks for reading and have a great day :)",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c5l4p0,My monitor isn't working,"Multiple posts today but also had a few stories go without being told.

$T1: tier 1 tech guy

Monday $T1 went on site to setup a computer for new $user. He's done this a lot and it's a simple setup. 2-4 monitors, wireless keyboard and mouse, desktop, and wired network connection. The equipment isn't perfect, but it's reliable for sure.

Tuesday rolls around and $user calls bright and early.

$user: My second monitor doesn't work

$T1: ok let me pull up your computer, one moment.   
Can you see the screen with all the icons on it?

$user: yes

$T1: ok, so you can't see this second screen with nothing on it (we can see that the screen is showing an active connection to the computer).

$user: yes

$T1: So you can't see me moving my mouse on it?

$user: no

$T1: is the power light on the lower right side on?

$user: yes

$T1: can you turn it on and off

$User: yes, it's still just blank

t3_c5kzfh,Did I call the right number?,"So yesterday I get back from a week long vacation in the middle of nowhere and have no clue what's been happening since I left. Turns out it was a pretty busy week for the office and we had 2 clients dealing with a DOS attack throughout that week.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I get tossed a project that needs completion same day and we promised the customer we would solve it or we wouldn't charge them (my boss was tired of them taking their sweet time deciding on our contract and was also tired of dealing with the ISP that had sold them a managed wi-fi solution that wasn't working so he might have talked a big game to get them to bight).

&amp;#x200B;

Problem: Customer has managed wi-fi that they brought in with their ISP's phone solution as a nominal add on rather than go with a proposal for us to set them up with their own stack. They call us 3 months after the ISP came in and want us to figure out why they can't scan to e-mail. I do a little bit of digging and the SMTP settings are not setup properly for the KM MFC that they're using. I get it fixed and they call back 2 days later saying it's broken, turns out the router the ISP installed is blocking the printer's traffic and only the ISP can log into it. The router then decides to block some users' traffic as well and now they're in a bind.

&amp;#x200B;

Today is the day we have to fix it all to prove why they should have gone with us in the first place. I walk in to their closet. There's 3 modems, 3 routers, 2 switches and a whole nest of cables. The old system is still connected to a live IP so I get to work resetting it (their old MSP didn't give any documentation on any of it and no one knows the logins for any equipment new or old). I get to a red box that we'll call ClockSentry. I'm not super familiar with their stuff but like any tech, can google my way around most problems. The reset looks like it worked and a network scan shows the box on it's stock IP and my computer in its subnet. I try to login through the web browser with no luck after multiple attempts through multiple browsers. Ok, time to call tech support for this box.

&amp;#x200B;

TS: Thanks for calling ClockSentry, can I get the serial of the device you're working with

Me: sure it's \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

TS: ok, and what are you doing

Me: I'm with an MSP and I was hired to reset this box for a customer, they own it but no one knows the password, I need to confirm that the ip of [10.0.1.1:8080](https://10.0.1.1:8080) is what I should be looking at and that the username and password are: \*\*\*\*\*\*\*

TS: yes that's correct

Me: ok and are these serials locked to an e-mail, as in if I reset it I can't activate it because it's already activated to someone else

TS: yes, that's correct

Me: ok, so I followed the instructions on the guide and it's not letting me get to the login screen, here's the lights that are flashing do you need more information to help me/can you help me?

TS: Sir, you can get the instructions by going to the partner portal and downloading the instructions for that model

Me: I don't have a partner portal, this is the only customer that uses this device and we didn't set it up

TS: Sir, you can also just google the instructions as well. Here, I'll do it with you on the phone to show you, I'm typing 'ClockSentry KindleCub T30' and the second result comes up with our website and the user manual

Me: yeah, I'm already reading it and followed the instructions but it's not booting up properly or I messed something up. Here's what I did (explain the process), is that correct?

TS: according to what I'm reading, yes

Me: anything else?

TS: yes, you may need to plug into port 1 as the other ports might not be trusted since it was reset

Me: ok, I have it plugged into port 1, it's powered on, and nothing else is plugged in

TS: Sir, it needs the wan port connected to the internet

Me: I'm just configuring it for the reset, does it need an internet connection to pull anything from your site

TS: No

Me: Okay, so I'll leave WAN unplugged

TS: No, you need to plug it in to access the box

Me: I'm connected directly to the box from my computer on LAN 1

TS: That won't work

Me: why not?

TS: Your box is on the network and you need an internet connection to connect to the network and reach the box

Me: \*\*concerned silence\*\* (at this point my Sup walked over to check on me as he had heard parts of the conversation)

Me:  (trying to oversimplify the process without screaming) Let's pretend this red box you guys made is just like my computer ok? I want to transfer files to it and plug a cord into it and run it to my computer, do I need an internet connection for that?

TS: no

Me: Okay, so why do I need one for your box right now

TS: I don't understand

Me: So this isn't going anywhere, you haven't answered my main question, other than googling the issue is there something else you can provide me with?

TS: \*says no without saying no directly and talks in circles for another 2 minutes\*

Me: Okay, I'm going to go now, I'll figure this out myself

TS: Sounds good sir, please call us back if you need further assistance.

&amp;#x200B;

And because I don't like leaving stuff out, it turns out that the box made it look like it was good to go but was in some kind of fail safe mode to prevent the reset from happening just in case you accidentally did this magic procedure that takes 5 minutes and changed your mind after completing all the steps (none of this is mentioned in their guide, found it on a forum).

&amp;#x200B;

Got the customers services working again on their old equipment and found a hidden AP in the ceiling on the first guess (lifted up the tile and it was right in front of me), then flipped the AP over since it was pointed at the ceiling. Customer is very happy and all around shocked that we made it work. They're now going to pay for my time and my bosses time when they could have paid a fraction for the initial stack instead (or the one we proposed after the ISP mucked it up).",talesfromtechsupport

t3_c59v0t,"Really, you bill for $200/hr?","So, this is a rather short story as it happened close to a year ago, but is probably one of my few examples of someone being banned from calling us.

So, I work in a datacenter. I am not a manager and not in a position where I’d be comfortable saying that I am if one is out of the room, even though I am the most senior in my position and everyone kinda defers to me and my judgement (sometimes before the manager). Customers can call in to report outages but requests must be done electronically and anything regarding their accounts is required to be handled by their local security desk, but their local security desks all tend to hear our name “DC” we will say and tell them to call us (even for desktop issues and application issues in their computer, which is handled by a local desktop support office).

On to the story.

The admin (“ea” for entitled admin) calls in requesting that we reset the password for and unlock her account for logging into our servers. EA is not very polite about it, but I look up the account (so I can refer her to the right people) and let her know “unfortunately, we don’t manage these accounts, you will have to contact xandsuch group.” EA then proceeds to tell me about how she has called in numerous times in the past to have this done and this is a work stoppage for her. I won’t mention every time she cursed/swore at me, but I assure you, it was about every third word starting at the beginning of the call (I have thick skin and swear like a trucker [not to/at customers] so normally I ignore when customers do it because I don’t care, normally.)

I inform the customer that we have never been allowed to do these password resets or unlock the account. EA proceeds to inform me that she bills her customer at $200/hr and this is a waste of her time and their money. It takes every fiber of my being to not ask why, if she is so important and amazing to be making that much money why she can’t remember one simple password, or to find a “secure” way to store/track it.

It was a very busy day and the people that usually ran our datacenter checks were shorthanded and swamped where we had a full team and a fairly light load. So, my manager hits me up in our internal messenger and asks if I can run the check, since I’m the only one in my position trained on it (again goes back to the most senior thing). I tell him I’d trade him, I’ll do the check if he finishes dealing with my phone call. I explain the full situation to him and he knows I could have finished it but also doesn’t know why I hadn’t transferred EA sooner. So I inform the customer that I’m going to have her speak with my manager, give him the call and go do the check.

I get back and ask my manager how the call finished. Told him about some of the things (specifically the $200/hr bit) and apparently she told him the same stuff, and proceeded to also curse/swear at him too.

She was then reported up the chain by my manager all the way to the top of our organization who then spoke with the person at the top of EA’s organization. EA was then specifically debarred from ever contacting is again, which 100% led to her getting fired, I can just shy of guarantee it, because we house all of their servers, and as an admin, if you can’t report issues to us, especially when there are nationwide outages.

It really feels good knowing that I likely contributed to someone like EA probably getting fired.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c5h5qe,"Customers telephone line is ""inconveniently"" placed","I work for a big ISP as a manager in a call center. Today I got a request from a front line agent for a customer looking to speak to a manager about moving the telephone line running to his house. No other information.


M: me, manager
C: customer 


M: Hi this is manager from ISP, you requested a callback about your telephone line? You'd like it moved. Is it in a dangerous location? 

C: Well no, I've explained this before, the cable runs above the window on my roof and birds keep shitting on the window because they sit up there and shit the whole day, it's the only thing they do other than make noise and I DEMAND this line is moved, it's damaging my property and I will sue if it isn't moved. 

M: I'm sorry to hear that, but we really can't move the line.  Your service works fine, and it's not a danger. We aren't liable for ... the birds. You can have a third party move it if it is really such a concern but we can't help. 

C: I AM A LAWYER. I KNOW MY RIGHTS. YOU HAVE TO MOVE THIS OR I WILL BE DRAGGING YOU THROUGH THE COURTS 

M: Like I said, we aren't moving it. And we aren't paying for someone to move it. I can direct you to a section on our website where you can find the mailing address of our head office if you wish to make it a legal matter, but the contract you signs has some pretty tight T&amp;C's that specify we don't move the lines unless there is a danger. 

C: I want your manager. 

M: I am the manager. 

C: No you have a manager and I want to talk to them. 

M: My manager doesn't work for ISP, they work for this call center and arrange my timetable, the highest point of contact for ISP is me unfortunately. You are welcome to send a letter to head office, they are above me. 

C: I'm going to have you fired

M: If you believe that will help then by all means you are welcome to try. Is there anything else I can do for you? 

C: You can move the fucking cable you cheeky bastard

M: I'm sorry if I came across as being cheeky, I just meant to be honest. If there's nothing else have a great day.

Ticket came in for a separated employee who had the local site ID.. Alright, guess this one is on site, that should be easy. Since the ticket already came in, the employee is already gone hence their accounts are disabled. Had to reach out to the manager. Manager is not on the same site, this employee didn't have any other team mates from the same site. HOLYSHIT.

Here's the juice:

Client: I have full intention to return my equipment! They (she really meant me from the voicemail) said they reached out several times and I didn't respond. I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING. I just got back today and saw FedEx stickers on my door. FedEx didn't leave the package! I can't return it!

Client: \[endless rants\]

I had to explain to her that when her manager terminates her on system, it will then generate a ticket for IT to retrieve the ticket. The manager has to do it after you leave (YOU DUMBASS) because if she did it prior, your accounts would be disabled before your last day. That's just how the company policy works. How the fuck would I know anyone's last day is until I get a ticket? My site is 400 people. The company (just USA) has 30,000 users. Of course this bitch wasn't listening to me and just kept yelling at me.

Karen calls my phone and tells me she’s having an issue with her monitors. I go to her desk and take a look - both monitors are switched off so at first glance I assume it could have been a thunderbolt dock issue or something along those lines. 

After asking her about her issue she tells me she’s switched both the monitors off because “THEY WON’T COPY AND PASTE FAST ENOUGH”. Thinking she may have got her words muddled - I switched the monitors back on and asked her to show me what the problem was.

t3_c5hot6,When a server migration goes wrong,"This happened close to a decade ago at my old job as IT for copy/print.  I was a boots on the ground support, Level 1 was at the time internal along with L2 and L3.  We were pretty much L1 without access to the KB articles.

So it was server refresh time.  EoL servers getting replaced with new ones.  Our task was to rack the new servers next to the old one if possible or stage it next to the old server.  Plug the servers into a 6 port gigabit switch and plug that into the main switch into it's designated port for server traffic.  Then fill out the InfoPath form with the iLO info old server IP and a few other details.  The server team would then schedule the migration of live data from the old server to the new server.

The data was important, these branch servers handled the POS software, transaction data for the customer facing equipment, print server and job tracking as part of the POS software, along with other things.  So the order of operations was: 1) server team logs into new server and starts setup, 2) server team updates form with migration date, 3) when complete server team migrates data on scheduled night, 4) when migration is complete wipe the old server and shut it down, 5) schedule on-site tech to plug new server into the proper main switch ports, ship back old server.

Pretty simple on the surface, but this wouldn't be here if it worked.  So I had an Alpha location, testing the process.  Worked like a charm.  Then I had a Beta location and it burned to the ground.

I get a call from the Manager saying he's got an open ticket, server is being rebuilt, a bunch of stuff has to be manually configured and he has no registers.  I then get a call from a 2L tech basically breaking down what happened.  Whoever was doing the migration skipped some steps.  They started the config on the new server, then started the wipe of the old server, then was confused when the data migration failed.

The site lost all transaction data for the previous day.  It lost all job records so pending jobs or completed but not paid for jobs all had to be manually re-entered.  Server support had to set up the new server like it was a brand new store and I had to go in and enter all the site data for the machines, printers, etc.  Then re-configure all of the registers and card readers.

My boss calls me sometime in the afternoon as I was setting things back up.  Having heard my voicemail about a site being completely down he wanted details.  He was less than happy with the details.  When we went to release for the rest of the country a new set of steps went out.  Now there was a verification check in about 3 places by a second person before the server wipe could be done.

Even better the site was already scheduled to be permanently closed.  They only had the new server in place for about 3 months.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c5hgsf,Roadside service for an Ice Road Trucker,"Hey, just learned about this sub and figured i would share the only happy memory i have from my half a year working as a roadside service agent in Texas.

So i worked the later night shift with a small team i had trained with and essentially how our system worked was we would find out generally what was wrong with a vehicle and where it was located then contact local tow truck companies near them and pay for the service, sometimes that was automated and the tow company would just be sent a work order but if those failed we would have to call the tow companies manually. 

So i was taking calls through the night, typically they ranged from like 3-10 mins and we are scored on how quickly we can deal with situations to keep a constant flow coming in, and i pick up a call i can just tell is going to be plummeting that score right away when he mentions he's in Alaska.

Ive never had an Alaska call up to this point but i had heard in some areas and small towns it can be difficult to find a reliable tow company, but then this guy explains his situation a bit more and my heart starts to drop.

""well i got a ride to this halfway station in between anchorage and prudhoe bay, but im broke down about a hundred or so miles up the road""

As im tracking to figure out where in the hell this guy is on my map, i realize hes got to be at least 400 miles from the nearest town, this halfway station thing hes at is for people making this trip across the ""Dalton highway"" which is apparently featured pretty heavily on the titular ice road truckers .

So at this point i say score be damned and get determined to get this guy some help out there, low and behold the automatic tow company finder fails so i start ringing people up in anchorage. 

Only like 3-4 people who even know where he's actually at even consider it but we have to take down quotes so we can pass it on to the the next level of people they know what it might cost the company, and every single quote was hovering around 2500$. 

So i try to call the guy back and end up having to call the halfway station he's at since his phone died and explain that he is TECHNICALLY covered for a unlimited millage tow pickup under roadside assistance but that i would be having to pass it up to a higher up to try to determine what would work best for him, i told him that i did everything i could and changed his phone number in out system to go right to the halfway station and wished him luck getting out of there, he thanked me.

At this point between going back and forth with the man, the halfway station, my cooworkers and supervisors (who had at this point formed a small crowd around my desk) and the tow truck companies i had been on this case for nearly 4 hours, and i figured i had done everything in my ability to get this guy some help, so i passed it off to a higher up after a lengthy explanation including that he was in fact actually covered for this.

So yeah, ice road trucker broke down halfway through his voyage, i always wished i could have seen how that story concluded once the higher up took over but i would have to assume they simply paid the 2500$ since the alternative meant blatantly ignoring our liability and opening ourselves up to a lawsuit.

like i said, only fun memory of that shitty job, it did tank my score for a week or so though.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_c592st,Tales from Aircraft Maintenance: Stuck Snow Blower on a Stick,"In a past life I was an Air Force avionics technician. I had quite a few interesting experiences; good, bad and otherwise. A few of them I can even share with all of you here.

Note: after [my last story](https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/c56bc4/tales_from_aircraft_maintenance_a_journey_home/), I need to go back to my usual speed

It was a windy freezing cold winter day on the flight line. The kind of cold that freezing cold does not begin to describe the chill I felt deep within my bones. I was once again on de-icer truck duty.  Which was not necessarily a bad thing, the truck had a good heater.  Thankfully, I was senior enough to be the driver not boom operator. My day would consist of positioning the truck and waiting for my boom operator to spray the jet down, then reposition the truck and wait once again. Rinse and repeat. This was before smartphones were really mainstream, so I had a book to read.

Note: a De-Icer truck looks similar to the trucks the power company uses to fix power lines, but with an enclosed box at the top with a fire truck looking sprayer attached. It’s actually quite fun.

I went to the motor pool to sign out my home for the day and brought it back to the maintenance building awaiting my boom operator and jet assignments for the day. I called on the radio for my boomer to come out and wait for his arrival.

10 minutes pass and still no boomer. I call again.

15 more minutes pass and still no boomer. Its -50F out I am not looking to un-ass this truck to go find him.

At this point my expediter is calling angrily over the radio for me to start on the first flyer of the day. I am forced to get out of my heated, comfortable truck (the one with the FM radio even!) and find my boomer. I reluctantly get out of my warm heated truck and into the bitter frozen cold, walking the 100 feet to the maintenance area to find my boomer. Growing angrier with every step. My rage keeps me warm.

Upon arrival in the break area, I ask who my boomer is for the day and no one answers. I shout again and still no answer. Finally someone tells me who my boomer is and where to find him. He is hiding in an unused office because he doesn’t WANT to do this. This A1C (E-3) is in the same Air Force that I am in. What you want has no bearing on what you do. I walk up to this scared looking A1C and tell him to get his ass in the truck, he refuses. I give him the benefit of the doubt and ask him why, he responds that he is afraid of heights. Oh boy, today is his lucky day! He is about to face his fears I tell him. Before he knows it, he has found himself in the passenger seat of the De-Icer.

I definitely did not put hands on him and drag him out and you can’t prove that I did! It’s his word against mine!

Once in the truck, he seems to be more afraid of me than heights now. I am not a small guy. I proceed with the safety briefing and the procedures we follow as this is his first time in the boom. This takes a boring 15 minutes that I will leave out of the story. I ask if he’d been trained on the operation of the boom. He, of course, had not. I spend the next 30 minutes doing so, much to the angry objections of my expediter. This dum-dum is my responsibility and I don’t want to deal with his hitting a jet or otherwise damaging something. I really hate paperwork.

We, finally, get to the jet and I carefully talk him through the movement of the boom and how to use the sprayer properly, the fear is audible in his voice. You could hear him shaking over the intercom. After a painfully long interval, he finally gets positioned to spray down the jet and seems to do well on the first wing. He slowly brings the boom into storage position and we reposition the truck. The other wing goes similar. His confidence level is growing by the minute.

Onto the tail we go. The tail of the C-5 is quite high and extending the boom 5 stories is nerve-wracking to most people, the wind will sway the boom a lot at that height and the ground looks miles away. A1C Boomer after a little pep talk gets all the way up.

At the peak of his extension, the truck shudders and my control panel lights up with multiple warnings. A1C Boomer is stuck. At full extension. Five stories up. Thankfully, intercom is still up and I can tell this terrified kid a bold faced lie. I had seen this before and I’ll get him down shortly. I called in the truck issue and start basic troubleshooting of the system. I know nothing about how to fix this truck. That doesn’t stop me from trying.

I restart the systems using the procedures in the book without success. I check the breaker panel in the body of the truck hoping for a popped breaker to reset. No joy. I genuinely feel bad for this kid stuck in the air. In the course of my troubleshooting, everyone not actively engaged in launching aircraft gathers around offering unhelpful advice and getting in my way. I send one of the spectators into the building to call vehicle maintenance and dig into the maintenance manual for the truck that I found on the internet.

As we wait for the vehicle maintenance team to respond, I go back on the intercom to once again try to calm a panicked boomer. Completely failing to do so. We now have a new twist, he has to tinkle. I ask him if he has any empty bottles in the cab. He doesn’t understand my question so I have to turn my question into telling him to pee in an empty water bottle 5 stories up with half my squadron watching. Of course, by this time someone has climbed into and up the tail of the C-5 he is stuck at. After a good ten minutes of convincing him that peeing in the bottle in front of everyone was better than pissing his pants he accomplishes the task at hand. The guy on the tail of the aircraft filmed the voiding of boomer’s bladder on his phone. Sometimes I hate camera phones.

Another hour passes with Boomer getting more agitated, still no vehicle maintenance on site.

Sometime in the third hour, the fire department is called. The fire marshal arrives, “assesses the situation” and deems the positioning of the boom in relation to the aircraft as unsafe unless the situation becomes “dire”. Boomer thinks this situation is pretty dire already. I can hear in his voice that he is starting to crack and it won’t be long until he does something stupid.

At the four hour mark, I have had enough waiting and may have found a solution. I need to do something that we have all been specifically forbidden to do on these trucks. There are a series of relief valves on the side of the truck to manually operate the boom, but with no power it is very risky. The Air Forces gets a little grumpy when you dent one of their jets. I tell my expediter what I am about to do and he has everyone clear the area. He specifically tells me this is not his approval, as to avoid liability, only a safety measure. I refer to the manual to find the right lever, locate it on the truck and then check the book again to confirm. I gently push it and nothing happens, so I push harder. The upper portion of the boom comes slamming in to the lower limits but I did not ding the jet. I did, however, ding Boomer. Tired of his whining and wanting to end this situation, I hit the next lever, gently easing it into releasing the pressure and lowering the lower boom portion.

Only after getting Boomer nearly to the ground did I notice the pool of hydraulic fluid at my boots. To my surprise, and mentioned nowhere in the manual, these were purge valves and not release valves.

After the final valve was released, we use a ladder to retrieve Boomer. When I helped him down, I noticed a distinct smell. During the rapid decent and him banging his head on the top of the cab (I told him to use the harness in the truck), he shat himself. (To my credit, I didn’t make fun of him for that until days later.) We pretend not to notice and have him walk back to our building.

About the time he is walking away, vehicle maintenance shows up. Only 5 hours after the emergency call. The NCO who was responded is irate because of what I did to the truck. An argument ensues and is thankfully broken up before it becomes violent. I storm off and fill out the required paperwork as go home time was 3 hours ago.

A week later I receive a written counseling for “abuse of a government vehicle” in lieu of the requested Article 15 that the vehicle maintenance squadron commander wanted. I then had to come in on my day off to do “De-Icer operator training” which entailed shoveling snow around the squadron.

Moral of the story: Sometimes doing what is right isn’t always “right”.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c59bdz,More from Aviation Maintenance: Flipper 75,"*29 May, 2007*

*Kandahar, Afghanistan*

I grinned as I pulled my wash cart gator up to the CH-47 Chinook helicopter due its periodic engine maintenance, aircraft 644.  It was a bird I’d not gotten to see yet, on loan for a big op the following evening.  The aircrew was also out of Bagram and had never gotten their engines washed by our crew so there was an opportunity to do a bit of teaching for the crew.

&gt; **ZeeWulf** “Good afternoon, Sergeant!  Ready to give this dirty birdie a wash?”

&gt; **SSG CrewChief**  “Sure, Specialist!  How do we do that?”

SSG CrewChief was a rather warm and friendly southerner, and was quite willing to learn.  That made the job, already an easy and enjoyable one, even more fun for me.  

The process for washing a CH47 engine was pretty straightforward.  On the side of the Chinhook below the engine on each side was a quick disconnect to which I would attach one of two pressurized cylinders.  The first would be a water/soap mixture, the second was rinse water.  The Crew Chief’s job was to run the APU and turn the engine while I operated the wash cart.  The Crew Chief would start the spin, I would open the valve for a number of seconds, and then I would close the valve and announce that over the headsets to the Crew Chief who would motor the engine for a few more minutes before shutting it down.  (Motoring an engine is supplying start air to turn it, but not turning on the fuel and ignition.  There’s a certain duty cycle you have to maintain for time of spinning the engine in this way, because otherwise you risk burning out the starter.)  I would then disconnect my soap line, drive the gator to the other side of the helicopter and we would repeat the process.  

As soon as the second engine was soaped up and soaking, I would drive back to the first engine and then dismount to allow it to soak for another couple minutes, hook up our download computer to the DECU (Digital Engine Control Unit) for the FADEC (Full-Authority Digital Engine Control---basically a fancy electronic suite to run the engine efficiently) and download the DECU’s data and log files.  Once completed, the soak would be over and we would repeat the process, this time using rinse water.  

It was a fun duty that let us get out and talk to our customers and see the birds and out from the ever-watchful eye of our squad leader.  I spent a little bit of time talking to SSG Crewchief before I packed up my gear and made my way back to the shop.

***

*30 May, 2007*

The next morning, I found myself at 644 again, which had moved since I last had seen it to sit in front of our spare clamshell, a place it would soon call home for a couple months.  I was on the hunt for one of our Technical Inspectors, and had been told he was out here.  Indeed he was, helping out another younger mechanic who was working on it.

&gt; **ZeeWulf** Hey, SSG Inspector, I need you to sign some paperwork here.”

&gt; **SSG Inspector** “No problem, Zee.  Hey, listen, can you give us a hand for a second?”

&gt; **ZeeWulf** “No problem, Sergeant. What can I do for you?”

He tossed me a fuel filter bowl from the #2 engine.  

&gt; **SSG Inspector**  “What do you think?”

I looked it over, and it appeared one of the wild cats of Kandahar had attacked it.

&gt; **ZeeWulf** “Yeah, it looks like you guys need a new one.  I’ve got one back in the shop.”

&gt; **SSG Inspector** “Great!  We’ll take it!”

I fetched them their replacement filter bowl, got my paperwork signed and wandered off again.

Late that afternoon, a massive airlift took off, numerous aircraft carrying a load of infantry to the Sangin Valley in Helmand Province—the operation the on-loan Chinook was here for.  I’m not sure what exactly was going on, other than standard infantry ground-pounding.  

***

Late in the evening, I felt the urge to leave my room and take a walk, so I stepped out of our barracks and took in the wonderful Kandahar night air.  I noticed there was a group of people standing in the road nearby, talking in urgent and hushed tones, so I went over to them to find out what was going on.  The person speaking, it turns out, was my doppleganger—a Chinook inspector who’s name was, aisde from his middle, identical to mine.  I asked him what was going on.

&gt; **SSG ZeeAHWulf** “We’re on communication blackout now.  We just lost 644.”

&gt; **ZeeWulf** “..I just worked on that helicopter.  What happened?”

&gt; **SSG ZeeAHWulf** “RPGs.  Three of them.  Hit as it was lifting off, so none of the infantry were aboard…”

His voice got quiet.

&gt; **SSG ZeeAHWulf** “..I heard them.  I was in Maintenance Control when they got hit.  I heard them burning…”

I was shocked.  We were all shocked.  This crew I’d just met was gone in a blink of an eye.  I know one never expects to lose an aircrew, even though this was war, so it hurt pretty badly.  

At that point the story goes that the infantry had been pushed off the crash site by Taliban forces, and only retook the wreckage once given additional support from Special Forces.  I have no idea if this is what really happened, but our Detachment CO (Our company XO), Captain America, wanted our DART (Downed Aircraft Recovery Team) to be prepared to be called on to secure the crash site.   From what I understand he even gave the Lord Farquadt speech (Some of you may die…) and was getting all psyched to go before being told to stand down.  

Besides, a DART is pretty much pointless when the helicopter you’re being sent to recover is spread  out over several hundred yards.

A couple days later we held a memorial for the five crewmen of Aircraft 644, Callsign Flipper 75.  That evening was the Ramp Ceremony where we sent our friends back home one last time.  They and their passengers, a Canadian combat photographer and a British Military Policeman were loaded aboard a C17 to the heart-wrenching bagpipes of the Canadians crying out with the song *Amazing Grace*.

***

 A number of weeks later, a half dozen Jingle Trucks rolled up to our spare clamshell, their cargo a load of dirt and debris.  A DoD investigation team of Civilians came out and took control of the clamshell, and we learned the contents of those Jingle Dumps were the remains of 644 and a whole lot of dirt.  It turns out that after recovery, the locals contracted with the duty drove over to a local FOB and dumped it all into a trash pit, which required us to scoop everything up, dirt and all, to bring back for reconstruction.  

We all took our turns helping with the efforts, putting the engine pieces in their places (the new filter bowl was still shiny…) or manning the sifting screens.  Of note for me, I discovered in my turn on the sifter an airspeed indicator still locked in at their speed upon impact, and the clasp end of the monkey harness one of the crewchiefs had been wearing.  

After that, I couldn’t do it anymore and never returned to help reconstruct the helicopter.

***

*Epilogue*

Every now and again, I would look up what happened to 644, to remember and to see if any new information came out.  A couple years ago, a revelation in the story was made that made me furious.

When 644 went down, we were told it was several RPGs impacting it in the nose and auxiliary fuel tanks.  It made a sort of sense—those helicopters wouldn’t take much to take out, and a pair of RPGs would do nicely.  However, it turns out that was a cover.

What actually had happened was the Taliban had a MANPAD in the area, a weapon we were never told they had.  I don’t know that the knowledge would have changed anything, but, it still feels like a sort of betrayal.

&amp;#x200B;

I handle everything at a call center PC troubleshooting to PBX programming. One of our leads isn't the biggest fan of mine. I get the final say in all hardware purchased and this lead got it in her head that she could find a better headset for the agents. She couldn't, all the options she pitched were trashed, but in the process she got in the habit of CCing my supervisor as well as her supervisor to try and catch me up and prove me wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

The group of agents she's over handles our customers that need to be treated with a much higher level of white glove service than the rest of our customers. Process is extremely important to this group, as a mistake could (and has on occasion) cost the company $40k-$50k to fix it. The lead mentioned above is over this group.

&amp;#x200B;

Well her little habit finally came to bite her in the ass, I came in to find an email where she had examples of calls that weren't being routed correctly, with both our supervisors CCed of course. You could almost hear the smugness dripping from the email, she finally caught me making a mistake. I traced the call logs, pulled the recordings, referenced the knowledge base. Turns out, both calls were transferred over to her group because they fit under a very important process, one that if it was not fixed it could be potentially life threatening for the customer. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I sent my findings back on the email...

&amp;#x200B;

...with both supervisors CCed of course, I mean if she didn't want them on it she shouldn't have created the  email that way right? Lets just say they weren't very pleased with their lead not knowing one of her most important processes.

t3_c5b3iv,Selecting a Source Isn't Optional,"As mentioned in the past, I work at a University Helpdesk. My role is combination of helpdesk management, classroom and event support, and print acquisition and management. This one falls within the realm of classroom and event support.

All of our classrooms have AMX systems with a touch panel (TP). This means that a nice little 12"" touch screen is in every classroom that controls all the systems. You can choose to project from the podium PC, a laptop via VGA, wirelessly, the DVD player, etc. You can also control the microphone volumes and the overall audio volumes from the touch panel. Ugly as all hell since the guy who created the layout this has no flair for design, but extremely functional.

I get a phone call from the helpdesk saying there is a classroom call on the line. It's from a personal cell number instead of the classroom phone (which is a no-no because if we are busy, I'll pick up a classroom call but not a personal phone) and he's not even in the classroom as to not disturb class. He informs me that the projector is not working and is projecting just blue (so... The projector is working... just not projecting what you want. Great). I tell him I can't help him if he's unwilling to go in the class. He begrudgingly goes back into the classroom to troubleshoot and explain things to me.

One nice thing about our system is that I can ""remote"" into each TP from my own TP at my desk. So, I connect to this room's TP and see that there is no source selected. These systems by default do not have a source selected right off the bat. While this may be confusing, there are big letters on the screen that say.... Two guesses...

# SELECT SOURCE

t3_c52su5,"Tales from $University Helpdesk: ""No, you don't understand, $LargeBank Can't send emails!""","Background:

I'm an undergrad working for my university as Tier 1 Desktop Support. I answer phones and help users reset their passwords mostly. Occasionally some more in-depth troubleshooting, [helping users with account issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/c1ib00/tales_from_university_helpdesk_no_thats_protected/) and the like.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the summer break, we don't have to deal with the normal student ""I can't login to BlackBoard/$MyUniversityDashboard problems as much. Today, I had a call from a ""semi-retired"" user with what seemed to be a pretty simple issue.

Me: Technology Service Desk, this is $Helpdesk, how can I help you?

&amp;#x200B;

$SRU: Yes, hello? Are you there? I'm $NameIThinkStillCarriesWeightButHasn'tIn15Years, and I'm having issues getting my email?

&amp;#x200B;

Me:Oh, okay, what seems to be the problem specifically, are you not receiving email that you should be?

$SRU: No, it's not that. The thing is, I normally use my phone, it takes me right to the email, but on my desktop, I can't seem to find the log in page! Can you please point me in the right direction?

Now, it should be noted that the user is audibly frustrated, and I can't say that I really blame her. $University website is in dire need of an overhaul in terms of general layout, and that project is kinda sorta happening, but it seems to be happening on a department by department basis, with some web pages being orphaned. Now, there is a drop down menu on our main page with a link to your $University Email (which is now GoogleApps as of a few years ago), but if you didn't know click a button that's disguised as a tab for a drop-down menu, I can understand how she missed it. Thus far she's been polite with me. That's about to change.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Sure thing! On your computer, can you go to $[University.Mail.Edu](https://University.Mail.Edu)?

$SRU: One second, sorry, can you please repeat that?

Me: Sure, *gives address again, slowly*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***Cue Red Flag #1***

&amp;#x200B;

$SRU: Okay, I'm there. Wait, this isn't right. This looks like GMail!

Me: Yes, we switched email providers some years ago. Are you in your inbox now?

$SRU: Well, how would I know that?

Me: Top left of the web page, you should see a circle with a letter in it, should be the first letter of your username. Do you see that?

$SRU: Yes, and it says $Username, and Managed by $University

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Then this is the right email account, you're logged in to your university email account and this is your inbox.

$SRU: But there is email here from $LargeBank here, that's not possible!

Me: Do you bank at $LargeBank?

$SRU: Yes, but they never send me email, they can't! I never gave them my email!

Me: If you logged into their services using this email address as the contact info for your account, or into any service or app that they have by clicking ""Sign in With Google"" while signed in to this account, that is how they would have gotten it. If you think it's a phishing email or spam, you can just forward it $HelpDeskSpam, and we can take a look at it for you and add it to our filters if need be?

&amp;#x200B;

I phrased it as a question as I was getting the feeling this user didn't like taking directions, so I wanted it to come across as an offer. I was about to learn there is no right way to do anything on this call, and that sanity is simply the mind's way of defending itself in a world of madness.

&amp;#x200B;

$SRU: Is that a comment, or a question?

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: Both. They could have gotten your email any number of ways, If you think it's a phishing email or spam, you can just forward it $HelpDeskSpam, and we can take a look at it for you and add it to our filters if need be.

&amp;#x200B;

$SRU: And what would that do?

Me: We would be able to inspect the email then, and if it's malicious, we can adjust our filter accordingly.

$SRU: How do I do that?

Me: You just need to forward it to us.

&amp;#x200B;

$SRU: Which one? How?

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Any one of the emails you feel is suspicious.

&amp;#x200B;

I then proceed to spend five minutes explaining how to open the email, click the three vertical dots for ""more"", then click ""forward"".

&amp;#x200B;

$SRU: What address?

&amp;#x200B;

Me: *gives address, one letter at a time, in the NATO Phonetic*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A blank email from $SRU appears in our inbox. She somehow ignored every instruction I gave her and drafted a new email, all the while telling me that she had completed the steps I had been giving her.

&amp;#x200B;

Another five minutes is then spent doing it again. We never received the email in question.

&amp;#x200B;

$SRU (now very frustrated, and interrupting each answer to ask the question again): Now how are they sending me emails?!

&amp;#x200B;

Me: At some point, you gave them your email address, OR--

&amp;#x200B;

$SRU: I never gave them my email

&amp;#x200B;

Me: OR you logged into a service or app using this email account, and they sold that information to their advertising partners, of which $LargeBank is definitely one of them. I just looked up the credit reporting service you named from the email, that is a service that your bank offers, they sent you an ad. You can just mark it as spam or delete it if you want.

&amp;#x200B;

$SRU: Listen, I'm sorry, I know you're *trying* to help, but we're just going around in circles and getting off track, we need to solve my problem

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I'm sorry, there probably was a miscommunication somewhere. My understanding was that you could not get in to your email inbox, was there another problem aside from that?

&amp;#x200B;

$SRU: I couldn't get in to my email inbox, and I have emails from my bank, but they can't send emails. I don't understand that.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: You should call your bank, and ask which email account they have for you on file. If it's not this one, it may be a phishing attempt--

&amp;#x200B;

$SRU: No, you don't understand, that's not possible for me to do!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ...

&amp;#x200B;

$SRU: If I call them I don't get my local branch of $LargeBank, it's a corporate helpline, and all they can do is look at your account!

&amp;#x200B;

That's when it dawns on me. The user thinks that her bank account is somehow firewalled in her local branch, and that there is no way any information she's given to confirm her identity with her bank, or to use their mobile app, or online banking ever left that branch, and that if she calls corporate, they'd have to go to her local branch and all they'd be able to do is look up her account balance.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Well, you can just mark these messages as spam then. They're just advertisements.

&amp;#x200B;

$SRU: FINE! Guh, how do I do that? There is no spam button!

&amp;#x200B;

I then spend five minutes of ""Click this button, no this button. it's shaped like a stop sign"" vs ""There is no button. No, there is no button. Oh, you mean the button""

&amp;#x200B;

$SRU: Why is this so complicated? Well, it's done.

&amp;#x200B;

Normally I'd ask if there's anything else I can do to help. But after over a half hour of pain, I'm done.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Have a good day.

I get a support ticket for a user who has stated that their account is locked and they no longer remember their password for server X.

This server is a RHEL6 box so changing a password is a quick process.
I go ahead and change the password for the user and use chage so that the user must change it on login. 

Admin: hey I changed my password but I still cant get in.

Me: hmm ok let me take a look really quick.

The account is not locked and the password is set. 

Me: you must have typo’d your password on entry can you try again? 

I go through my same process and reset the password again.

Admin: this still isnt working for me.

Me: wtf... 

I proceed to dig through logs and see for a fact that he is typing the wrong password on login.
Thinking that he just keeps typoing the password I go through the process again with the admin hoping that he will get it. I COULDNT BE MORE WRONG, this continued for FOUR HOURS. 

Me: How are you entering the password admin?

Admin: I am copying and pasting it so I know I can’t be typing it wrong.

Me: ... how exactly are you copying and pasting the password?

Admin: *sounding annoyed*, ctrl-c ctrl-v duh..


Me: *smashes head against desk* right click in the puTTy window.... you cant ctrl-v into puTTy.

t3_c3pjjb,Apples and Pears,"When working for AppleCare phone support, you can get a whole bunch of stories, to the point that what can be hilarious to an outsider becomes pretty forgettable for us. But I'm going to share a story that's happened over a year ago.

I was already a senior advisor by then but we'd often get regular, first line calls if the first line is all busy. This was for the UK line (on a different team now).

A man comes into the call saying that he's forgotten his phone passcode and now it's disabled. Pretty standard, but I've noticed a pattern that passcode lock customers are usually the ones with the lowest IQ/lowest technical skills.

I let him know that he needs a computer to restore the phone back to factory settings with iTunes and he doesn't have one with him. No worries, he's being nice so I decide to take ownership and we scheduled a call for later in the day.

A few hours later, I call him back and ask if he now has a computer, to which he says: ""Yes, I've come to the library and I'm now by the computer."" It's a Windows PC and I ask him if iTunes is installed. He doesn't know and we can't seem to find it. I then let him know that libraries don't allow programs to be installed without an admin password. He asks me to wait a bit and goes away.

A few minutes later, he comes back and says he's now by a computer that somehow can install programs, as told by the librarian. We look for iTunes again, still not there. I offer to screenshare but the program doesn't open because it requires an admin password and then this lovely interaction:

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""So I'm pretty sure we won't be able to get iTunes installed on here but all you need is a Windows computer with Windows 7, 8 or 10 or a Mac and th...""

Cx: ""But this is a Mac.""

Me: ""Is it? Okay, let's see if it's up to date then. Can you see the Apple logo on the top left corner of the screen?""

Cx: ""No.""

Me: ""Fair enough, the top bar can be hidden. Put your mouse on the corner and wait a couple of seconds. Do you see it now?""

Cx: ""I still can't.""

Me: ""Right... Can you then see the time, on the top right-hand corner of the screen?""

Cx: ""No.""

Me: ""Right. Is there a big black Apple just below the screen?""

Cx: ""No there isn't.""

Me: ""So that's not a Mac. Again, find a computer computer with Windows 7, 8 or 10 or a Mac from a friend or something and let me know by replying to the email I sent you earlier.""

t3_c3f147,No Need To Ask The Guy Who Manages The Server,"LTL-FTP.

Background:

I'm a System Engineer for a company that makes software for a different organization. My main job is patching and maintaining virtual machines that are located on servers in another part of the country. The people in that other part of the country manage the servers and have control over the resources my VMs use. One of the VMs uses an automated build and release suite. Another VM is set up for code analysis as part of that build process.

&amp;#x200B;

Cast:

Me = Me

Dev = one of the developers who relies on the two aforementioned VMs

Boss = Our supervisor who has no technical background. Rumor has it he used to be a manager at a bank.

SE = Senior system engineer. Also kind of my supervisor. Doesn't get along with Boss.

Server Dudes = The people in a different part of the country who manage the physical servers

&amp;#x200B;

Story:

Dev walks into my office. ""Hey Me, just thought you should know that all my builds are failing and the error code says something about $codeAnalysisProgram.""

Me, ""Okay, let me just go to the web client for it and see what's up.""

 ERR\_CONNECTION\_TIMED\_OUT 

Thinking to myself, ""What the hell? Maybe the server got rebooted and the service didn't start back up.""

To Dev, ""Well since the code analysis not working is holding you back, I'll remove it from the build process until I fix it so you can keep doing your code wizardry.""

So I do that as a quick fix while I troubleshoot. Boss gets upset when anything gets in the way of ""Continuous Development/Continuous Integration"" and wouldn't stand for new builds being held up by code analysis. Now I try to remote into the VM to start the service back up.

Remote Desktop cannot connect to this computer for one of these reasons... blah, blah, probably turned off, blah

Alright, no big deal, I'll just check out the VM management web client.

I go to the website.

I login.

I allow flash.

&amp;#x200B;

The server isn't listed.

Wat?

I walk over to SE's office. ""Hey SE, Server Dudes wouldn't just delete a VM without talking to us, right?""

SE, ""I don't know, probably. Why? Did they?""

Me, ""Well it looks like the code analysis VM just disappeared. So I'd say yeah.""

SE, ""You should probably go talk to Boss. I know he was talking to Server Dudes earlier about something.""

So I wander on down the hallway to Boss's office. ""Hey Boss, would you happen to know anything about Server Dudes deleting a VM recently?""

Boss, ""Yeah, I told them to delete one that didn't do anything. Why?""

Me, ""About that. That VM was running our code analysis on it.""

Boss, ""What do you mean? In this spreadsheet that only I use and/or know about, it says that VM doesn't do anything.""

Me, ""Well maybe next time you should ask the person who manages the VM instead of asking your spreadsheet.""

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Boss deletes a VM because he didn't think to ask anyone if it did anything. Causes build failures for code.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c385fp,Keyboard Exists Between Keyboard And Chair,"Here I was yesterday, enjoying my afternoon, when all of a sudden a certain $User called me.

$User owns a Korg Kronos, which is a rather complex and full-featured music synthesizer workstation. That is, a big piano keyboard, a touchscreen, lots of knobs, buttons, and LEDs, USB and network connectivity, digital and analog audio input/output, etc. This beast has [nested tabs within tabs within tabs](https://mrcn.st/t/kronos_sc1.png) of settings. It's a pretty big ordeal to figure out how something is currently configured that you don't quite know the details about.

$User was playing some simple piano music when all of a sudden, they explained, the entire keyboard shifted an octave lower. It's as if they had started playing one full octave (12 notes) to the left of where they were on the keyboard. They hadn't pressed any buttons or done anything explicit. It just happened randomly. Changing instruments (which discards any changes made) fixed the problem, but it would just happen again later.

I checked out the keyboard, which was currently in that strange state, and started digging through the menus. Synth transpose? No, that's set to zero. Octave shift for the main synthesizer engine? Nope, also 0. Master transpose? Zero. Transpose (which shifts the keyboard by some number of notes) was mapped to a slider on the front panel, but that was solidly in its center position, and moving it did what it was intended to do. Of course I could move the slider all the way up (12 notes up) and that would cancel out the problem, but that wasn't fixing the underlying cause.

The Kronos has a feature called ""compare"" that allows you to back out any changes that you have made to the current configuration, and temporarily go back to the stored settings for the currently selected instrument; pressing the ""compare"" button again restores modified settings. So I pressed the button, and as one might expect, the keyboard went back to normal. Pressed it again, and it went back to shifted an octave lower. Okay, so that means I just need to tap through menus while clicking that button, and if I see anything change, bingo, there's my problem.

10 minutes later, I found nothing. Rats. Okay, time to break out the big guns.

Pretty much any modern synthesizer supports MIDI, a standard for communicating music data between instruments, or instruments and computers. MIDI has some basic messages like ""note was pressed"" ""note was released"" ""pitch bend knob was turned"", as well as a generic ""controller change"" message that just means some knob or setting (numbered from 0 to 127) was changed to some value (from 0 to 127). Since synths have gotten *way* more complicated than 127 parameters these days, MIDI provides an extension mechanism called ""system exclusive"" (SysEx). That's basically an arbitrary message that is just a bunch of 7-bit data values, of arbitrary length, the meaning of which is completely up to each manufacturer. It's a catch-all ""proprietary settings go here"" message. The Kronos, being a monstrous beast of a synthesizer, uses system exclusive messages to transfer basically all of its configuration. Anything you do on the interface ought to translate to a system exclusive message (unless it's one of the few fundamental settings that are assigned to the 127 basic controllers).

Pressing the ""compare"" button, since it basically resets all the instrument settings to a prior state, also should send a massive SysEx message with all the settings. So I logged in to the computer that was attached to the Kronos via USB (which includes a MIDI interface), and started up a tool to dump all MIDI messages out to the screen. Indeed, pressing the compare button dumped a huge screenful of data out. I clicked it repeatedly, toggling between the good and bad states, trying to find any bytes that changed, but nothing stood out. It was identical.

Okay, so maybe the SysEx dump that gets sent is a bit incomplete, and even though that button resets all the settings, maybe the huge single-message MIDI dump that it sends isn't *quite* comprehensive and misses the important part that changes. So, how about I go back to the proper config, and start playing some music, and see if the problem happens again?

So I did that, and I was playing along, seeing all my ""note on""s and ""note off""s on the screen, when all of a sudden everything shifted down an octave again. I scrolled back a few lines and saw this

    F0 42 30 68 43 1A 00 00 06 00 00 00 01 F7

Okay. What the heck is that? All SysEx messages start with `F0` and end with `F7`. The bytes at the beginning probably specify which setting was changed, and that `01` at the end is probably the value. So `00` is probably normal. Let's try that hypothesis:

    $ send_midi 24:0 SYSEX,F0,42,30,68,43,1A,00,00,06,00,00,00,00,F7

Yup, that made things to back to normal.

    $ send_midi 24:0 SYSEX,F0,42,30,68,43,1A,00,00,06,00,00,00,01,F7

And that made the keyboard shift again.

But what *is* that setting? What the hell makes it go off randomly? Time to get the documentation.

Korg's SysEx documentation is a pile of text files with, shall we say, less than stellar organization. The first table is a list of ""Function codes"" for the 5th byte, which says:

    |  43  | Parameter Change (integer)               |Receive/Transmit|

    [43] Parameter Change (integer)                                           Receive/Transmit
            F0, 42, 3g, 68          Excl Header
            43                      Function
            TYP                     part of parameter id (see combi.txt, etc)
            SOC                     part of parameter id (see combi.txt, etc)
            SUB                     part of parameter id (see combi.txt, etc)
            PID                     part of parameter id (see combi.txt, etc)
            IDX                     part of parameter id (see combi.txt, etc)
            valueH                  Value   (bit14-20)   (*4)
            valueM                  Value   (bit7-13)    (*4)
            valueL                  Value   (bit0-6)     (*4)
            F7                      End of Excl

Okay, so that fits. Now what's TYP=1A? Well, there's no table for TYP... there are a bunch of separate text files that list the type byte values in separate sections, with no grouping of where I should look. I spent some time digging through, until I finally found that `1A` is ""Controller Info"" in Program.txt. So it's changing a controller - controller #6, which comes a few bytes later. And then there's a ""Controller Info"" table, which says...

    param   index        value                      name
    -----  ------  -----------------  --------------------------------
        6    0..1               0..1  Panel Switch State

""Panel Switch State""? Like all the switches on the main panel of the Kronos, to the left of the screen? I checked all those on the controllers screen, and nothing was hitting those. Wait. No, what Korg calls the ""switches"" (SW1 and SW2) are *specifically* a pair of buttons on top of the joystick that's to the left of the keyboard...

I look to the left and spot the Bluetooth computer keyboard sitting on top of the Kronos. Resting neatly on top of SW1. The SW1 that, in the default piano patches, is configured to shift everything down an octave. The switch with an LED indicator, which is the only way to tell its current status, as it is not otherwise shown in the UI (unlike the bank of controller switches/knobs to the left of the screen, which is). The LED indicator that was conveniently hidden by the bluetooth keyboard sitting on top.

I quietly picked up the Bluetooth keyboard, placed it on the adjacent desk, and walked away.

I may have also been $User in this story.

TLDR: I spent 30 minutes digging through MIDI messages to figure out that I'd left a keyboard on top of a switch from another keyboard.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_c3dtwp,No Desktop Central did not create those 10 icons on your Desktop,"For a preface I am a software engineer whos role has been transitioning more towards cybersecurity.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the things we want to do to keep our systems secure is to have an inventory of the software used along with controlling what software users have on their computer to and patching of software. Manage Engine Desktop Central perfect for this task lets install on a server and test out.

&amp;#x200B;

All works fine so roll out to the company the Desktop Central agent (to get an inventory of what people use) and accidentally left one application being pushed. So whoops people say whats this (due to desktop icon) nothing broke though all is fine I even change from pushing to all computers to only push to my test device. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well as we know there is that one person. This person first off thinks I broke their computer and since they are all friendly with our IT contractor have him uninstall the agent. Which I immediately push again (users can't tell the agent is even installed due to setting have agent hidden). 

&amp;#x200B;

Then this person comes and complains I put 10 new icons on their Desktop (they never showed me so I don't believe it anyway) but I do have to manually put the agent on their office mate computer (the agent was having trouble pushing to the computer through domain). To which they responded no we can't risk you breaking their computer you have to wait till the end of the day. I can tell when we start actually pushing applications to computers now who will be the headache. Wish me luck when that time comes around.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c3bq1w,Volitile Voyages,"I’m back. This will be a few stories concerning our electronic charts (VMS), it uses RGB cables and amplifiers to relay video, a monitor, and keyboard with a trackball.

Story one.
The trackball mouse is mounted in the keyboard and held in place by a retaining ring. The one for the quarter masters (QM’s) was missing, it is still difficult for one to fall out without the retaining ring.

My work center supervisor (ET2) got a call to the bridge because the QM’s VMS keyboard was having “issues”.

QM3: The trackball fell out.

ET2: How?

QM3: we took a roll and it fell out.

ET2: Let me get this straight. We, a Nimitz class aircraft carrier, took a 15+ degree roll that no one felt in the middle of the night and it fell out.

QM3:......Yes.

ET2 took a mouse and a PS2 adapter for it so the mouse could still be used.

Story 2.
I just came on watch for the first shift of the night on an underway and I got a call to the bridge. The Auxiliaries Officer (AUXO) was standing Officer of the Deck (OOD) placed a trouble call for the conn VMS. The video was ghosting. VMS is an old system and is routed through a KVM amplifier, the three colors will desync and display the same picture on screen in the three colors offset. When I got up there, the ghosting was bad. Plots, operation area, own ship, and radar contacts all had ghost images about three inches apart.

AUXO: VMS is doing this, take a look at it.

ME: Sir, this is an old system and the colors tend to desynchronize from time to time. I’m going to reset the KVM. You will lose picture for a moment, but the system itself will not be effected. Restoration ETA; 30 seconds.

I turn the KVM off and back on causing the video to be only slightly ghosted, opposed to being inches apart, the colors were right on top of each other. This was acceptable for operation in the past so I left it as was and reported back to AUXO.

AUXO: it’s still not fixed.

ME: I can try resting the KVM again.

AUXO: Do it.

KVM was reset again, but there was no change.

ME: Sir, if you want this perfect, I will need to reset the computer. This will take 15 to 20 minutes max.

AUXO: Let me get the Captain.

First thought through my head was God damn it. AUXO left the bridge and came back with the CO. I gave him the same rundown that I gave the OOD.

CO: get your chief (C) and the Combat Systems Maintenance Officer (CSMO) up here.

C and CSMO both come up and, without a word about what I had done up there, gives AUXO and the CO the same steps and guidelines I had advised. The CO is still not convinced and we tasked another of my coworkers to grab the steps in black and white. We showed the CO where it said what I wanted to do in black and white and got the ok and fixed the problem.

This one was particularly frustrating. I’ve had issues with AUXO that you will hear about in later posts. In addition to that, the CO knows my chief and the people in my work center by name and knows we are extremely capable. This also took about 2 hours.

Story three.
We were three days into an underway. I was chilling in my shop and got a call from the watch floor saying they got a call from CSOOW (Combat Systems Officer of the Watch) that “VMS looked weird”.  Most of our VMS stations sit on the bridge and with the navigation department on the 09 level, I was on the 03. I poked my head into CSOOW’s watch floor to alt what they meant and said “I don’t know, that’s what the Operational Specialists (OS’s) in Tactical Operations Plot (TOP) said.” I worked my way up to top and was greeted by OS2 with this gem.

ME: what’s the problem?

OS2: It looks like charts aren’t loaded, we have black marks all over the screen, and the computer is running slow.

I look at the screen, then at them, then at the screen, and back an forth a few more times.

ME: You know that old phrase, not the sharpest tool in the shed?

OS2:....yes.

ME: you guys barley make up the planks of the shed. The reason it looks like some charts aren’t loaded is because their not.

OS2: Why not?

ME: That’s mainland USA.

OS2: So?

ME: Last time I checked, we have propellers and rudders, not treads or wheels. We navigate water, not land, so there is no need to have navigation charts for the Midwest. Now, all those black marks are changed in depth. These changes tend to be a bit more common and drastic the closer to shore you get. That is why they seem to be clustered around the shorelines. Now, the computer is slow because you have Kansas on the left side of the screen and the Arabian Gulf on the right. Restoration will be about an hour.

OS2: Why?

ME: In order to fix it, I need to log out of the computer and log in as the administrator to run some diagnostics. The state you guys put this in requires me to go to the computer itself to reset it.

The computer was turned off and back on, was logged in as the admin account. Both internal drives were sitting at 99% fragmentation, I’m convinced that the only reason it didn’t say 100 is because the computer is too old to register that. About an hour later, VMS is restored, I set the screen to about 120 square miles of water.

ME: Don’t zoom out much past this.

OS2: Why not?

ME: What you were requiring this thing to do is too much for this system to handle. Don’t do it again.

t3_c38ndo,"He literally did not know his password, but had been using it for 30 days.","So the migration of new computers always brings challenges. New printer setups, program reconfiguration and the inevitable ""What is my document?"" problem, but THIS beat everything.

We were in the middle of rolling out new computers to several people. The latest was placed in out production department as a shared computer. Our daytime manager was off today and I had to setup his backup which also used the computer. We will call him John.

I asked John to sign in so I can start setting up his profile. John attempted. ""Hey my password is not working.""

Me: ""Try again""

John: Nope still not working

Me: Hmmmm your password might be locked out. - A call the the helpdesk and my colleague confirmed that it was NOT locked out, but they went ahead and issued an unlock.

Me: OK try again. - Nope that did not work either.

Me: So what is your password. - Technically we are not supposed to ask but he can reset it easily enough and I am just trying to get him in.

John: I don't know.

Me: What do you mean, I don't know. How do you type it?

John sat down at the keyboard punched 13 characters very quickly and said ""See it don't work""

Me: Wait what is it you are trying to type.

John: I don't know.

Me: Show me. very slowly. - What happened next threw me into a ""Holy pattern recognition, Batman"" moment. He started by typing a pattern on the keyboard of 1,q,a,2,w,s then he turned on the caps lock and typed it again 1,q,a,2,w,s. So his actual password was 1,q,a,2,w,s,1,Q,A,2,W,S. He literally did not know what it spelled out because all he concentrated on was the ""pattern"" of the keys he pressed and in his mind he could not figure out what exact keys he was pressing or what was capitalized and what was not.

Come to find out the issue was being caused by a faulty key on the keyboard actually not registering anything. (I think it was the Q key). A keyboard swap got him up and running but to this day that is the weirdest password selection method I have ever heard of.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c34nlp,That moment when you realize how far you've fallen,"I've worked in a tech support for several years now, and this one story still stands out in my mind as the most egregious ""Wait, WTF am I doing?"" moments in my career so far.   


**Important background:**  
Without going into sensitive detail, suffice it to say that my company helps customers understand and fill out complex legal documents, and get those documents forwarded to the appropriate entities. These are not just your ordinary people off the street. You have to be semi successful to even need our service. So that right there automatically filters out the majority of what you would consider problem people. Most, if not all, of this process is done electronically, and we have a website to help facilitate people getting documents filled in and sent out. It is very common for people to call us, and tech support will walk them through filling out a document, starting from logging into our website, complete to forwarding copies of it to relevant places.  


The story:  
This call starts out the same as most of my other phone calls. A man calls in and wants help logging in and getting his documentation sorted out. Looking at his account, I'm sure this will be a simple call. 15 minutes, tops.  


Oh how wrong I was.  


He didn't know his login details, so I do an identification. Once I've confirmed he is who he says he is, I tell him his username, and send him a password reset email. It takes him several minutes to login to his email account. That should have been my first warning that things were going to go badly, but I wasn't nearly as jaded then as I am now, and didn't think anything of it.  


After spending several more minutes just trying to help him find the right email, I'm starting to catch on that this gentleman isn't as tech savvy as I would have thought. But I was optimistic. We have several options for people that have trouble, so I figured I could help him work through this. Even if he isn't tech literate at all, we can often break down the document he needs to complete into simple enough steps for almost anyone to complete it. I'm already writing up my call notes in our incident logs in advance because it is a busy day, and I suspect I wouldn't have much time between phone calls.  


This is where things start to go drastically and rapidly downhill. I spend 10 minutes, 10 MINUTES, trying to help him get his own password setup. I don't remember exactly what was said, but the conversation went something like this:  


&gt;**Customer:** Why isn't it accepting my password?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Does your password have X, Y, and Z in it?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Customer:** I don't have Y.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Go ahead and add that, and then try again.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*He tries again. It is refused again. This happens a couple times.*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Customer:** Its still not accepting my password. *(I can hear him starting to get frustrated)*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** OK. Lets go through it one at a time. Do you have at least one X?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Customer:** I have a \_\_, does that count?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Yes, how about Y?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Customer:** Well, no.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Why don't you just add that on the end and then try it?  


Several more minutes of this later, he is obviously annoyed, but I am determined to help him figure this out. I really don't understand why he is having such a hard time. I think he could tell that I really wanted to help, because he was very polite the entire time. I have to give him credit, not once did he raise his voice or imply that I was giving him less than the best service, even though he was annoyed.  


Since things were going nowhere, I decided to fallback on a manual password reset from our end. We prefer customers make their own passwords for several reasons, but if push comes to shove, we can assign them a password from our end. We help customers change it to something only they know after they have logged in. I have him hold while I go to my supervisor, and get a simple password setup. I asked them to make it nice and easy, and they did.  


Now starts the final leg of our journey. By this point the phone call has already gone nearly 20 minutes. The customer and I are both ready to be done, and he hasn't even logged in yet. I direct him to our website, which was more difficult than it should have been. He couldn't figure out how to navigate to our website or pull up a search engine. I had to send him an email with a link that he could click in order for him to get to our website. Luckily this only took another 5 minutes or so.  


I direct him to our login page, and read him off his username. Then comes time to give him the password, and my expectations of how bad things could get immediately dropped to an all time low.  


&gt;**Me:** Your password is ""\_\_\_\_\_\_\_!!"" *(note that the exclamation points were part of the password)*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Customer:** What's an exclamation point?  


  
My face was just :|  
I'm almost certain English is his first language. After working in a call center for very long, you MUST learn how to tell when someone has less than adequate English. Its a survival skill. If their English isn't very good, it completely changes how you talk to a customer. You can get in trouble if the customer is having trouble understanding you, and you don't compensate for it. This man had set off none of my ""Non-native English speaker' flags. How on Earth does he not know what an exclamation point is? I try to explain it, but get nowhere fast. Then I realize there is an easier way to go about this.  


&gt;**Me:** Ok. I want you to press and hold the Shift key on your keyboard. While still holding Shift, press the number one a couple times.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Customer:** What's the shift key?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Its the large key just below the........  


I just stopped mid sentence. It was at this precise point where I realized the new low to which my expectations had sunk. If I thought they took a hit after ""What's an exclamation point?"", hoboy. They were now so low I think they vanished entirely. I work with people who are supposed to be successful! How could he have possibly gotten this far without knowing how to use his computer? It should be impossible!  


This was the first time that I just gave up on helping a customer. I couldn't think of any way to help him. I was at a complete and total loss for words for a probably 5 or 10 seconds. The customer asking if I was still there broke me out of my shock, and I quickly fell back on our last backup for situations like these. I asked the customer if he would like us to mail him the document. I asked a customer who is supposed to be a successful individual if I could send a technical document to him in the post, because he couldn't login to our website. A document that assumes a level technical knowledge that I KNEW was beyond this individual in almost every way.  


This was the day that I broke a little inside. As I was submitting a request to have the document printed and mailed out, I am ashamed to admit that my only thought was ""At least I won't be the one to help him go through this."" I was relieved that when he received the document and called back in to get it explained to him, it was almost guaranteed I wouldn't be the one to take the call.  


Thats all there is to tell really. I never did find out if he got that document completed, or forwarded on to the relevant entities. While I kind of wanted to know, I never looked him up. Deep down I think I understood that if I did and his documentation wasn't in order, I would feel responsible. So I'm sorry I can't tell you what happened to him, but that was the end of it for me.  


TLDR: A individual who shall remain forever nameless didn't know how to use even the most basic functions of his computer, and seemed unfamiliar with written English when a total familiarity with computers and English is basically required for him to have ended up where he was.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c2urvv,Did not expect users to be this stupid,"Hey hi hello, newbie here! Just started my first IT-job as a tech support and after two months I already have couple of facepalm-worthy stories.

The company I'm currently working at has around 300 users and the IT-department has separate team for server maintenance and team for general technical problems - where I'm located. Overall it has been real nice, users are mainly friendly and understanding because I'm a new face around here, but every now and then I have encountered shitty behavior and some very bias comments regarding me being a woman and working in IT (all these came from other women).

&amp;#x200B;

**1 - The Silent Skype**

This one was just plain funny, to me at least. User calls and complains that her Skype is all broken and useless - she can't hear anything through her headset and the other end couldn't hear her either. ""It worked this morning before I took the laptop to a meeting with me and unplugged the headset"", she said.

I went to her office to see whats up, she explains that the USB plug won't even fit to the computer anymore! I unplug the headset, turn the USB around, plug it in again, it fits and behold: MAGIC! Skype works again!

&amp;#x200B;

**2 - ""Do I Really Have To Press That Everytime?!?""**

Sidenote: In our company, every user has a laptop, dock, one or two screens and of course a keyboard and a mouse.

The woman of the story is known to be a tedious one, she is always bitchy and don't know how to use any kind of device, so we have to deal with her A LOT. For the sake of this story, lets call her Karen.

Karen came up and complained that her keyboard doesn't work at all and that it is very important that we make it work IMMEDIATELY. My co-workers were busy so I went with her and she was not pleased.

&gt;Karen: Oh, so I got YOU? \*scans me from head to toe\*

&gt;Me: Well yeah, I'm soon to be MSc in Information Technology  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: Well you sure don't look like that.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ....

We get to her office and I start troubleshooting. She went to get coffee since ""it's probably is gonna take a while \*side eye\*"". I look through the device manager and see that one of the docks USB ports says unknown device, so I just switched ports with the mouse and everything worked again. To be sure, I rebooted the computer, just to see if the problem would appear again. No, all fine and dandy. I went to get her from the break room and she was very surprised and skeptical.

&gt;Me: Hey, everything is working again, the dock just didn't recognize the keyboard for some reason.  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: You fixed it? Well I bet it won't work again if I reboot the computer, you just don't do your work properly...  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Oh, I rebooted it, just in case, and everything is working.  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: You didn't do it properly, let me do it

t3_c2zx7j,Let me tell you about my day,"I work in a GP surgery and my day today was made up of 4 stories; I hope you guys are ready for this read:

Story 1:

I walk into work this morning and there is a meltdown because none of the computers are connecting to the network and patients are about to come in....so I make my way to the server and the mains have been yanked out.... I ask the receptionist that locked up why it was switched off and she said because there was flashing lights so she got worried and pulled the plug!

Story 2:

10 minutes later I get a phone call...""help I've locked myself out of my computer"" ok I've reset the password try logging in now...nope it's locked me out again, so I reset the password and go to this person, I told her to put her username in which was right, and I put the password that I'd reset it to and it logged in, so that was fine, so I thought, I get another phone call from the same lady ""Help my emails won't log in with the password you gave me and now it's locked"" took me 27 minutes to convince her that the password that was changed was he windows password and not her email password.

Story 3:

Now I'm on my last nerve, I get a phone call from a doctor ""I've had enough of this monitor it never works....you need to come and sort it out"" so I walk down to his room take one look and tell him ""your computer isn't on""

And finally story 4....the grand finale:

To top off my day a doctor ironically nearly killed everyone, how you ask, listen up:

He brought in an extension from home so he can plug in his mobile phone, now there was two issues here
 1) The extension that he's brought with him is the stickiest thing I've ever see (he said his coke spilt on it while it was in his bag)

2) His charger has a naked wire


So he calls me and say's ""Quick there's a crackling noise come quickly"" so I run down there and as soon as I opened the door a bang happened and now I'm tackling a fire, by the time the surgery was evacuated I'd contained the fire and lost a computer and half the room in the process.

t3_c322ze,Shocked to Hear This,"Context: I work for a large school district in a fairly wealthy suburban area. All teachers and most staff are issued really nice, over $1000 touchscreen Windows laptops that usually aren’t old at all from what I’ve seen. When issuing laptops to teachers, they usually look brand new. Every year, teachers must bring their laptops in to have the essentials backed up, then wiped and OS reinstalled. I was tasked with taking in computers and backing them up to the teachers’ Google Drives.

Cue the other day: boss informed that one teacher would be coming in and was worried about an online backup, so wanted the stuff backed up to her own flash drives. She comes in, and the other guy I’m working with takes care of her and I overhead this. 

“Man these laptops are all old trash, we need to switch to Macs.”

I was shocked. Later I learned that this teacher did not trust technology at all. She said that periodically, she prints out all photos that she has taken on her “camera phone”, and backs them up elsewhere. She said she “didn’t trust all this Google stuff” and wanted to make sure that all her photos and everything was backed up to two individual flash drives, and that everything was deleted before we took it. Because, “if anything got out, it would be bad.” She talked about how she always sees people post themselves in bars or at parties and their children and how “they will regret it”. Now, I understand wanting to have privacy online, but to completely not trust the district technicians,  or Google, or the computer, I was amazed.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c31zqp,The Other Red Wedding,"As any Game of Throne fan knows, the Red Wedding was a really major event where something really horrible happened. In my old job supporting billing software, we had a defect so bad both in its effect and the effort to clean it up that we nicknamed it a Red Wedding. If a manager or coworker wanted you to help or work on something all you had to do was say you were cleaning up Red Weddings and you were left alone as long as you wanted.


What is a Red Wedding? When a patient goes to the hospital, known as an encounter, the type of visit is classified: outpatient, emergency, etc. One of these is a recurring encounter. It is for things like therapy, where you may be coming in frequently for the same thing but the hospital only bills you once a month. A recurring encounter has a -# at the end to signify which month it's from. We recommended no more than one year's worth(12) within a sequence before another encounter was made. 


When an encounter type is changed by a user, all of the charges on that encounter are credited off and reposted because things may be priced differently depending on what type of visit it was. If a recurring encounter is changed to non-recurring encounter and back, a Red Wedding is triggered. All of the charges are credited off but not reposted because the system sees the old charges that were posted before and doesn't think it needs to post them again. As far as the end user looking at our software was concerned, they ceased to exist. This would also suddenly put the patient into a massive negative balance since all their payments still showed up. This sometimes triggered erroneous multi-thousand dollar refunds. Users were also known to sometimes try to manually put charges back on the encounter based on what they ""remembered"" being there before, which seems borderline fraudulent to me.


This was something our developers refused to fix for years because they said users should not be doing that workflow. It fell to Support to find a way to identify and fix whenever a Red Wedding happened. 


The cleanup of a Red Wedding was equally horrible. It involved inactivating the encounter in the database and semi-manually making a copy of it with the same information, running a whole bunch of scripts to repost all the financial information back onto it. This was a nightmare because these scripts could fail for a number of reasons that were usually only detected by using a calculator to make sure all the balances lined up. Additionally, hospitals often broke the one year rule. Imagine someone running SQL commands in a terminal and using a calculator to figure out monthly balances for 3 years of hospital visits, that was me.


Over the years, we developed a few techniques to fix Red Weddings(including the appropriately named Thoros clean) but it was always a horrible process. Only a small handful of people were allowed to do them because of how difficult and dangerous they were to perform. One accidental database commit and you messed up 10s or 100s of thousands of dollars. A Red Wedding took at least a few hours but sometimes days or weeks of work to clean up.


A few weeks before I left, one person discovered a script another team used that basically undid the credit that would get posted and mess up the balance. As my last gift to the team I was leaving I wrote a wrapper script that enabled it to be run on as many charges as were needed. What once took hours or days now took minutes. I can't believe it took us 3 years of suffering to find it.",talesfromtechsupport

I work as a software analyst for a large wholesale distributor that operates in the U.S. And Canada. Our customers range from small 'mom &amp; pop' shops to multi-million dollar companies. My team is responsible for developing our customer-facing web and mobile applications that allow our customers to place orders with us. 

Typically, my responsibilites include code reviews, managing our CICD pipelines, infrastructure configurations, change control and more. But when our service desk and customer care reps are unable to resolve issues that end-users are experiencing with our applications, they escalate to my team for assistance.

For some context of how our applications work; a user profile is created in our system for each customer and then we link specific account(s) to their profile. An 'account' is simply the store for which the customer is ordering for. So if a customer is a chain of multiple stores, there is one account associated with each store location. Once the user logs into our application, they must select which account they wish to order for before adding items to their cart.

Our sales reps and account managers also utilize these applications to assist new customers by showing them how to place orders using our app while some reps and AM's actually handle all of the ordering for a customer. 

The cast of this story will be $Me, $CC = Customer Care Rep, and $AM = Account Manager.

I received the following email from $CC with $AM copied:

&gt;Hi $Me,

&gt;$AM has been having trouble accessing their accounts with $mobileapp. Could you please assist?

Not a problem. Issues like these come up from time to time due to the end-user not running the latest version of $mobileapp, their profile being deactivated or simply because the account was never linked to their profile. 

I log into our profile administration tool and look up $AM's profile. Everything looks good on our end. His profile is active and the accounts are properly linked.

I reply to the email and ask $AM if they wouldn't mind if I reset their password and set a temporary one so I can log in under their profile and see what's going on. $AM agrees, I log in, and I confirm that all of their linked accounts are showing up. 

I'm thinking, this is strange, but then again I have seen stranger things happen throughout the course of my work. 

I figure the only way to see what's actually going on is for $AM to take a couple of screenshots of $mobileapp on their device and email them back. $AM agrees but says they have no clue how to take screenshot. Shame on me for even assuming they possessed such knowledge in the first place. 

I provide $AM with the steps to take a screenshot and await their response. A few minutes later I receive an email with 3 screenshot attached. Each displaying a different page of their device's home screen. 

Now obviously I expected $AM to open $mobileapp and take the screenshots. However, after carefully looking over the one's they sent me, I noticed that $AM did not even have our app installed on their device.

I send one final email to $AM suggesting that they search the app store for $mobileapp and install it. Lo and behold, $AM can now access their customer accounts. 

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

TL;DR
Account manager reports having trouble accessing their customer accounts using our mobile app. Turns out they did not have our mobile app installed on their device to begin with.",talesfromtechsupport

Next morning, I drink some coffee, spend some time tinkering with my tempremental old Triumph, then make my way to Ivan's.  

Ivan has finished work and two SyQuest drives that need to go to the print shop. He wants to go with me to the print shop. He's excited about something.   
  
It's a 45 minute drive to the print shop. Ivan fights over the radio.  
  
The print shop is one of those places that hides secrets. It always has a few middle aged men with suspicious eyes playing cards waiting for _something_ that has nothing to do with commercial printing. There are sterile cubicles filled with recent high end Macs- 8100s with professional grade monitors, but nothing else- no artwork, pictures or production schedules pinned to the walls.  
  
We drop the discs off and Ivan goes into an office to have a short conversation with the owner.  
  
I amuse myself by browsing the web and enjoying the air conditioning on a hot day.  
  
Ivan pops out, even more excited. 
  
Half-way home, he directs me to a dumpy strip mall. There's an unmarked office at the end of the five store strip.  
  
We enter the unmarked office. There are two desks covered in desktop PCs in various states of disassembly. Along one wall are wire metal racks of modems.  
  
There are two men and an older woman who are radiating hostility at us, each other and the world in general.  
  
Ivan introduces himself to the older woman, who ushers Ivan into the office. I'm looking around at the gear- it's mismatched consumer towers with missing drive covers, additional fans zip-tied to holes punched through steel cases. Modems are consumer grade systems feeding back to a rat's nest of cabling.  
  
The two men are eyeing me suspiciously. My hands are in my pockets, but that doesn't matter for much.  
  
I walk over the the closer one, the taller and older of the two. He's wearing a black Silence=Death shirt, jeans and combat boots. 
  
me:""How's it going? I've been curious about the gear you're running here""   
  
Tall Guy:""Don't touch anything. I don't trust you or Ivan""  
  
me (looking at Tall Guy's monitor):""Sorry. By the way, looks like you need your next Slackware floppy, there""    
  
Tall Guy:""I said, don't touch anything""  
  
Tall Guy pushes me out of the way and knocks over his stack of floppies.  
  
Of course, half of them are repurposed AOL floppy disks with Sharpie marks over top. Tall guy starts sorting through the pile of floppies looking for the next one in the series.  
  
I sidle over to Short Guy. Short Guy is a pair of Dockers filled with oatmeal. He's silent, but every two minutes he does a quick scan of the modems perched on the wire racks. I chatter on, hoping to engage him in conversation while Tall guy flips through his stack of disks like an angry Solitaire player looking for that six of clubs that will break everything open.   
  
Short Guy:""This is a shitty business to be in. Don't break even on the dialup. Only money's in the business stuff""  
  
I stop flailing with the conversation.  
  
Me:""really?""  
  
Short Guy:""Yep. Upstream's not cheap here and billing is hard""    
  
Me:""Good to know""  
  
Eventually Ivan walks out and into the parking lot. I follow and we drive back to his office.  
  
Ivan:""That's a mess. Her husband started it, promised those two knuckleheads a share, then died. She thinks they're taking advantage, but she doesn't know it works. It's a great time to buy""  
  
There's some silence while I drive and think of a clear way to use what I learned.  
  
Me:""Don't buy it, build your own""  
  
Ivan:""But it's going cheap""  
  
Me:""It's cheaper to do the profitable parts. Bandwidth isn't cheap here, but in the city, it's a fraction of the price. Just do business hosting and leave the consumer stuff to someone else.""  
  
I lay out my plan- two or three PCs running primary/secondary mail, FTP and web servers for business clients in $Resort_Area, but co-located in the same city as my college, where bandwidth was cheap. The current ISP is going to fold or fall over soon and Ivan already knows the business people from his publications.   
  
By the time we're at his office, I will build all this in exchange for a share of the business.   
  
I make poor choices.

t3_c2xcv3,Laptop self defense,"The extra hot VP of sales had to have the latest and greatest mini laptop, this was about the time when laptops were around $3k, this one was $5k. We got it all set up and she needed the dock, external monitor and everything else that she just HAD to have. The laptop probably didn’t leave the dock at all for a month except for the first day because she wanted to show it off. Then we get a call from the unconcerned user that her laptop isn’t working anymore,so I asked her what happened, and in the same nonchalant tone says, “I knocked a cup of of coffee over and it spilled into the laptop. The laptop started sizzling, then turned itself off, was it just protecting itself?” (The dock was also ruined)
“No that was the laptop burning itself out”
“Oh... well can you fix it.”
We told her to bring it to the help desk office and we will see what we can do. So we called our repair tech to come out and take a look the next day, when he picked it up to check the service tag a half a cup of coffee poured out of the laptop, the repair tech looked at us and said, “I’m afraid this can’t be repaired.” This was also at a time where accidental damage coverage was not available. So the company was on the hook for another laptop, we had to get it replaced “right away!” at a cost approaching $5k again. Since these laptops were not high volume items, it took a couple weeks to get it. The laptop arrived first but there was a delay on the docking station and it wouldn’t arrive for a couple more weeks. So i went to go set up the laptop and i had mentioned the delay, at which time the user said, “ oh that’s ok, I just gave my two weeks notice.”",talesfromtechsupport

A bit of background: I'm a Mexican currently living in France, I'm fluent English but I can't say ""pauvre"" or ""poivre"" properly, so when I can choose between speaking in English or in French I pick the first one.

I work for a software company, but for this tale I was the user, this happened in February:

My company had sent me to Nice for a two-day assignment, which I successfully planned for Thursday and Friday, with a return ticket for Sunday, leaving me with Friday night and all of the Saturday to get to know a bit of the city. Friday afternoon I had finished my assignment and I was relaxing in the hotel room, thinking about where to go that night to have dinner. There was another project whose planning I had interlocked with this one to be able to come see the city, but the other project being way more complex means that I would have better chances finishing it on time if I used every single opportunity to progress on in, so since it still was a bit early for the dinner, I decided to work a bit on said project (Still in the hotel room).

&amp;#x200B;

The software my company develops and sells is very micro-request intensive (It's a Rich Internet Application, among other things), which means trying to monitor the web traffic a single page uses is completely useless. When I was testing the web part of the application and modifying its code via a VPN and a Remote Desktop Connection I got disconnected from said RDC, which at first I tough was a problem with the VPN. I refreshed the Browser page to validate I would get a 404 error but instead I got an error message from the hotel's WI-FI network, saying that it had detected unusual behavior in the &lt;Application server&gt; address. I sighed and picked the phone to call reception, I knew the fifty-something year old man that was over there spoke English because I had spoken with him in the afternoon when I arrived, so I thought there would be no problem reporting the problem in English, I was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Me:  I was trying to access a site in the company but the hotel's network is blocking me, is it possible to contact network support to solve this?

Him: No

Me: \*Stunned\* Sorry?

Him: No, no, it isn't possible

Me: What? But why? I need to unblock the site to work on it? Could you at least provide the email address from the support person?

Him: No, please, that's not possible

Me: I see \*Finish the call\*

&amp;#x200B;

Next thing I did was informing my boss and the person from HR that the hotel's support service would be something to take into account for the next assignment over there. My boss' answer? Go meet the city. Fair, point taken.

I took a shower, changed clothes and went to the reception, ready to know a bit of Nice. I tried to smooth things with the host first, so I approached him

&amp;#x200B;

\*In English\*

Me: So, about the incident with the network, I...

Him: No, please, I don't know what's happening!

I saw his face and I understood what was going on, why he refused to assist in the incident and why he was being so defensive. The face you see in a deer about to be hit by a car. The face of someone who thinks he's being hacked and there's nothing he can do about it. I knew what to do.

\*In French\*

Me: Wait, wait, wait! I know what's happening...

Him: But I don't!

Me: But I do and I can explain you, that's what I do for a living after all, I'm a programmer

&amp;#x200B;

I gave him a quick explanation in French of what I was doing, what the system thought I was doing and why I needed to contact support to solve it. He got most of it and relaxed a lot once he realized I wasn't hacking the hotel's network. He even gave me the mail address of the support guys, alas, they would be available Monday at earliest. We also talked about Nice and the island of Corse, where he's from. My boss found it funny the host reacted that way, but other than that nothing else happened. Nice is too cold in February for my liking btw.

t3_c2s2ep,Click on the Apple,"In a former life, forever ago, I worked at a contracted Call Center for AppleCare. This story really only involves myself, OP, and Confused Octogenarian Lady (COL). At the time of the story, I was a Tier 1 Advisor, meaning I was essentially the first person a customer would be talking to when they called in.

There was a sweet voice who came on the line about an hour into a looooong shift. This was COL. 

""Thank you for calling Apple Tech Support, my name is OP, can I get your name and issue?""

""Yes, hello, this is COL, and I have X problem with my MacBook today""

(still to this day, for the life of me, I cannot remember the original issue)

""I'm sorry to hear that. You're saying X is your problem? Are you in front of your Mac right now?""

""Yes I am. I just have my email open.""

""Oh that's fine, COL, what I need you to do to get started, is click on the apple in the upper-left corner, go to ""About this Mac"", and read something off for me.""

(long pause, I hear minor frustrated grunting)

""Ma'am, are you there?""

""Yes. I'm having a problem with that. Every time I click on the apple, the screen goes dark""

I'm a bit shocked by this and wondering what this could actually be. There's no way a simple click on the apple would turn the display off. I try probing for more information.

""So all you're doing is moving your cursor to the apple, clicking, and the screen goes black?""

""Yes""

""Ok, is your screen back?""

""Yeah""

""ok, is your still email open?""

""Yes.""

""Ok, go ahead and quit your email and we'll try again""

""Ok. Email is closed. Moving the arrow... and... screen is black again""

There's about 20 minutes of me making sure that it is in fact a macbook, a recent one, and she is in fact our customer. I then have a sinking, dreadful feeling about something. I have her tell me what color the apple is.

""Ma'am, what color is the apple, the one you're trying to click on?""

""Let me see. I'll just close the lid and find out. It's white.""

I drop my head on my desk. My suspicion was confirmed. For over 20 minutes, this nice, sweet, old lady has been closing her macbook and physically tapping on the Apple logo on its back. I was both laughing and extremely frustrated at this point. I could not continue.

""Ma'am, I'm going to escalate you to a senior advisor"" is all I could muster through my headset.

After trying my hardest to remain professional when talking to the senior advisor (they are often in another call center), I immediately go to my supervisor and plead with him to never listen to that call. My pleas were in vain and it took a while to live that call down.",talesfromtechsupport

This story is not about that at all.

&amp;#x200B;

In my job, I am free to work from home pretty much at will. I have 2 kids, so I usually prefer to go into work to get my work done. But where we live, the kids don't go to school on Wednesdays. So instead of paying an inordinate amount on hiring a baby sitter for the day or sending them to the optional Wednesday school (I'm a cheap bastard), I work from home and try to keep them from killing each other in between tickets.

I had just put new batteries in it because it was acting faulty.

&amp;#x200B;

I hang up the phone on a client after tackling yet another stupid issue (WHERE ARE MY EMAILS??? Did you check the folder that the inbox rule you set sent them to? NO...)

$child1 - Dad? Can you check my ghost toy? It's not working right...

$me - did you try turning it off and back on again?

$child1 - Yes! I did that! (sound familiar?)

$me- ok, let's go and see.

&amp;#x200B;

So I go to his room and see the projector sitting on the floor. The gun is on and working, so that's not the problem. I check the projector, it's in the O-F-F position of operation.

$me-there's your problem, it's off

My job is to configure and ship Android/Linux-based mini-PCs that will serve as linear music players. A few clients are still reluctant to have our equipment connect on their network for updates so we have to configure them as stand-alone and send them music/software updates via USB keys (that I also have to generate, import on the keys and ship out). Those USB keys have then to be returned to us once the update has been performed on their device on site but every once in a while, we get sent back actual door keys (most likely their store's) instead of our USB keys. We then have to forward this to our support team who then has the pleasure of contacting the client and instruct them on the fundamental differences between a USB key and a door key. As they tell me, each time is the pretty much the same: the client either babbles in shame for their laughable mistake, or erupts in anger on how unclear our instructions were (some support agents told me they believe it's to hide their hurt pride).

After setting up everything i explained to her how the docking station works (just insert a usb C cable and you're done) and i leave her office.

The next morning she called me because she wasn't able to boot the pc, i went in her office and she was trying to switch on her old desktop (we agreed to leave it on a corner of her office WITH NO CABLES PLUGGED for a few days just in case we had to switch it on to recover/check something). I instructed her again on how the docking works and i leave again the office.

M: Hey xxx, how are you? How is it going with the new pc?

U: Hey! Sorry but i didn't have much time to use it. I've used it only 20 minutes yesterday during a meeting.

t3_c2i8j8,Unplug from the wall or from the tower???,"Back about 16 years ago, when I worked at TechSupportCo, this was by far the most common response you'd get when telling a customer to unplug their desktop computer. Literally, people don't understand electricity, and it doesn't matter whether you pull the power cord from the wall or the back of the PC case!


... But when I was working corporate escalations at TechSupportCo, I had a special one. Technically, all of my customers were special in some way or another: you were so upset about your computer being broken that you wrote a letter to the CEO of TechSupportCo. You didn't call my team, we called *you*. We had a policy that after corporate escalations fixed your computer, we were basically your personal tech support for the next week. You got my direct extension and email address. If we didn't hear from you after 7 days, we called to follow up.

Corporate assigns me a client, Jean. She'd been jerked around a whole lot by outsourced Indian tech support. Honestly, to this day, I don't remember what her issue was. I do remember that we had to have Jean swap some parts out over the phone, which meant she had to unplug the system. Which of course yielded the question:

""Do I unplug it from the wall, or from the tower?""

We wind up resolving the issue, and things are good, right? Wrong. 5 days after the issue is resolved, I get an email:

&gt; Hello alc6379,

&gt; Hope you are well. I am writing for advice: there is smoke coming out of my computer, and I think I can see a small flame inside of it. Please advise.

&gt; Thanks,

&gt; Jean


WHAT THE HELL?!?! So I call her back. Nobody answers-- the phone rolls to voicemail. I try calling back 3 more times; no answer.

*I seriously hope this computer didn't just burn Jean's house down with her in it...*

So since she wrote me an email, I think, what the hell? I'll send her back an email:

&gt; Jean,

&gt; I'm well, but I'm sorry to hear your computer is on fire. Please unplug the power from the computer. If there is too much fire, please call 911. TechSupportCo policy is to send a replacement computer if yours catches fire. I will send a replacement and contact you with further instructions. Please call me once you get this message. 

&gt; Regards,

Do I get a call back? No. I get an email:

&gt; Do I unplug it from the tower or the wall? Please advise. More smoke is coming from the PC.

&gt; Jean

I respond to her that it doesn't matter, to immediately unplug the computer, and to call 911. I try calling her again, but get no response.

5 days later, I get another email:

&gt; alc6379,

&gt; Thank you for sending me the replacement computer. Everything is working great right out of the box. I will ship the old computer back for your engineers to examine.

We got the old machine back-- it legitimately caught fire, I think it was the power supply or IDE cable to the DVD-ROM drive, if I recall correctly.

I'm relatively new to the tech field, which is to say, despite being a near graduated student in a field of tech, I lack the sweet nectar of experience we all rely upon to get by. My technical skills are always up to snuff, but my methodology is lacking. I am happy that there is a place like this sub where I can gain small amounts of vicarious experience at the expense of the users.

Now, onto what people actually come here for. This one is really, *really,* simple, but I hope you can enjoy it anyways.

This would be passable if we had enough people in these IT sites, but* ***NO****, we have exactly 3 people who know what they are doing; me, my coworker, and my direct boss. This creates a lovely workplace that would make me tear out my hair daily, if I had any left (check Username and PFP, it checks out). Now, while I'd love to present the unique working situation this place has to offer, I do not yet have the words to describe it sufficiently enough, and I have a story to tell.*

&amp;#x200B;

Now the tale begins.

&amp;#x200B;

'Twas a warm summer morn and the users were about -

Wait, no, wrong intro.

'Twas the peak of tech famine, at the end of the work day. I and my coworkers have all mentally checked out and are ready to go when *that user* comes in. Now, when I say that user, I don't mean anything rude. She's a nice enough lady, but she always has tech problems with super easy solutions that we are unable to articulate in any meaningful manner to her, so we always have to head down and fix it, which always takes mere moments and leaves her wishing she hadn't called us down there.

This one was a doozy.

The players:

**C:** Well, its me, the one with the chromed dome. The shine gives me away.

**SS:** Simple Sally. Not really named Sally, but it fits well.

**Boss:** The Boss Lady. A light in these dark times.

&amp;#x200B;

SS comes in.

&gt;**SS:** Hey, are you busy? I need you to come look at my keyboard, It doesn't seem to be working.  
&gt;  
&gt;**C:** Yeah, sure I can come take a look. What seems to be wrong with it?  
&gt;  
&gt;**SS:** Well, its not typing or responding at all. I changed the batteries and it still doesn't work.

At this point, I'm thoroughly surprised she has tried anything before coming to IT. Even though it was just one thing, a lot of people would have been halted in there tracks that wireless keyboards require power to operate.

&gt;**C:** Well, there are a couple of other things we could try.  
&gt;  
&gt;**SS:** I know what you are going to say, the same thing that **Boss** always tells me, to turn it off and turn it back on, but I really don't want to do that unless I need to.  
&gt;  
&gt;**C:** I can take a look, there's a couple of other things to look at before I take that step.

I learned from this sub to never assume anything, always start from the first layer: physical. Does this thing even exist, is it even the thing she's talking about, is it powered, etc.

By now we have arrived in her office and I'm checking it out, seeing if the usb is connected, are the batteries in the right way, etc. I'm checking this thing out, then I see the little button on the top right edge of the keyboard, and its turned into the off position. I flick it on, and place it down, make sure it types and turn to her and tell her what was wrong

&gt;**C:** It seems like the power was switched off. This power switch is in an unusual spot and it seems easy to turn off it you bump into anything. You probably bumped it against that - *Pointing to a paperweight near the on/off switch*.  
&gt;  
&gt;**SS:** ...  
&gt;  
&gt;**SS:** Well, thank you for trying not to make me look like an idiot, because it sure as hell looks like I am one.  
&gt;  
&gt;**C:** It happens to everyone, don't worry about it.

t3_c2dk6o,The computer is just full of Sh!t,"I have a few tail from working Tech support in a small Canadian town, if this one does well I may share some of the other gems.


So we were the only computer repair shop in town, and most of my days were spend running malware removal tools, cleaning 5 years of dust out of CPU fan and heat sinks, and diagnosing why someones PC was running slow.


For the most part this was an awesome job. My bosses were really lovely people, they allowed me to use the work car on my days off for personal use, and I was living in a beautiful place, I can't complain.


So Karen calls the store and I chat to her. She is a bit rough, so there was always some colorful language when talking to her. 


&gt;Karen : I need you to clean out my computer


&gt;Me : Sure thing, is it just running slow? Or is it complaining that it is running out of space?


&gt;Karen : It's just full of sh!t and I need you to just clean it up.


&gt;Me : OK, sure thing bring it into the shop and I will throw it on the bench and get working on it.


In hind sight, I really should have asked a few more questions.


So Karen brings in her computer, leaves it with my boss, and leaves. Luckily for me (and unluckily for my boss) I went to lunch, so my boss grabbed the computer to get started on it. He started connecting cables to the computer, only the computer smelled horrible! He grabbed a screwdriver and opened up the case, when he removed the side of the case he was greeted with a huge pile of sh!t ... literal sh!t inside the computer case.


Now one of the reasons I loved my bosses is that they didn't take crap from anyone, so he grabbed the computer and took it outside and left it on the ground, he then phones Karen and screamed at her to come pick up the computer and why the hell did it have sh!t in it? Apparently they had the side of the case off, and they had a puppy that needed to go, so it crapped in the computer. She didn't want to clean it and thought we would be happy to do it.


It still boggles my mind that she thought a computer repair company would be happy to remove shit from her computer.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c2kpbb,So I need to issue it for it to be issued?,"Same place as my [last story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/c0mf44/so_youre_telling_me_right_now_that_what_i_just/). May update on that one later.

As mentioned in my last story, my country uses an invoicing system that requires all invoices to be registered with the tax man, annoying to say the least. Many businesses may also require supplemental info to be added for internal processing, obviously not standardized which makes handling every individual customer a pain in the behind.

Recently a customer had a location opening, which required adding its GLN into the supplemental system. Our old 90s application has that specific selection as a hard-coded dropdown, we have to ask our local vendor to make a ticket with the developers to add said store to their system and generate a new database file with the store info added. This time though, they already had a file with said store added. After everyone is out for the day, I swap db the files, test that everything works ok and leave for the day.

Next day, a couple of hours after opening I get a call from our other office. Turns out the new file doesn't include a different field for a different customer, this affecting maybe 150+ different locations. As this customer is higher priority than a single store, we require to swap back to the old db file. 10 minute warning goes out, and I go to the specific user in charge for that single store.

&gt;Me: Store that was unavailable yesterday, is that invoice out?

&gt;User: Nope.

&gt;Me: Do it **now**. We have to swap back so it won't be available later today.

&gt;User: Ok sure, on it.

A few minutes later the user tells me it's done, I restart the application server, swap the file back, and eveyone is back online after a few minutes. 150+ store customer is now back, everything looks to be in order. A few hours later, same user calls me over:

&gt;User: The invoice for that store wasn't approved.

&gt;Me: What? Does it give out a reason?

&gt;User: GLN incorrect, it changed itself.

&gt;Me: Ok, the system shouldn't have touched the invoice after it was issued. Did you do *anything* to the invoice after the server restart.

&gt;User: No I just issued it.

&gt;Me: Why the fuck did you issue it *after* the restart?

&gt;User: If they're processed on this PC they error out so this specific customer is processed by User2 (right besides us).

&gt;Me: User2 you also knew about this, the whole company waited 10 minutes for that to be done why didn't you finish it before the restart.

&gt;User2: ... good question. Checked it before the restart and it showed up fine. Didn't think not having it selectable would delete it.

Guess I'm now stuck doing invoicing for a single store while we get the hardcoded fields fixed.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c2ly5j,"Lady destroys her notebook, blames us for data loss","Hello guys! 

This is my first post on reddit, and I'm not a native speaker, so sorry, (any advices are welcomed)

&amp;#x200B;

I work for a tech company as a tech supp/sysadmin combined. We are pretty small in worldwide relations, but fairly bit where i live. As anywhere else here everybody thinks that his/her problem is the most important.

The lady brings her notebook to us bc ""it doesn't turn on"". Alright i jump into checking, trying to turn it on nothing. i go through the basic things like connect a power supply, completly cut the power things like this. It costed me somewhere around 15 minutes, but she already started complaining how could i be so slow, so i give her a replacement laptop, everything was fine i thought. Important note: We encrypts all laptop's hard drive in case of steal.

Since i couldn't find the problem from the outside, and the warranty was still live for this product, i decided the best if i don't take it apart. I contacted the laptop's brand service, sent it to them, i contact our lady about this. She starts to get mad at me that a so simply task i can't solve and i need to get her data back.

After 1 day we sent it to the service (we don't have any contract with them, we just use their services like any end user, so there wont be any fast service or anything) she starts asking us when she gets back her laptop.

&amp;#x200B;

After 1 day we sent it to the service (we don't have any contract with them, we just use their services like any end user, so there wont be any fast service or anything) she starts asking us when she gets back her laptop.

I e-mail the service, to what to say our beloved customer when they will get her laptop back (they say basically 1-2 weeks, they haven't started it yet).

&amp;#x200B;

Company policy states that that you must store everything on servers, that's the only place we can guarantee that you can access your data.

Nevertheless we make backups of notebooks in a folder called ""Backup folder"" or ""Work folder"" or if they ask any wanted folder in case of anything happens. This is said in a multiple times to the users, in e-mails, in words, we show them where to save if they need to save locally and we ask them if we should set that the default save location for the documents.

Alright i check the backup. Empty. check the last run: the day before the story happens.

I walk to her and tell her that we can't restore because there wasn't anything in the specified folder that we told her to save in. The Lady starts to fuming to me that I said that to her that there is a backup so i need to restore it to her, bc she needs thoose documents.

I e-mail them again to take out the hard drive, we want to take it, and will give it back in a couple of days to place it back.

they take it out, calls me, and tells me that after the repairman took the SSD out placed in a replacement for testing the system came back to live in the moment, so they tested it at the moment, it is dead. They don't have the equipment to fix it, if we want it we can take it (bc of the data we would take it anyway to destroy it).

&amp;#x200B;

I started to look into what we could do, i found a company who can restore all kinds of hard drives, for SSD-s they take somewhere around 1500$ to examine it after they gives you the cost of the data backup (As i calculated in my mind if they only needs to replace the board under the flash chips it could stop at 3000$ but it can go up to the sky) i asked my manager about it, he said there is absolutely no way the company pays for it, if she needs the data pay for herself.

&amp;#x200B;

I went on a vacation the next day, so i couldn't deliver the bad news for the user, so my colleague did this, i sent all the information he needed in an e-mail.

&amp;#x200B;

later i found out that she started that we are so incompetent stuff, and my colleague isn't as calm and introvert as me, so he told the lady If she would save everything on the server as she should as the company policy states, or at least saves in the asked folder as she was told multiple times there won't be any issue.

&amp;#x200B;

So she started to restore everything she worked on the last couple days from e-mails, i think she lost somewhere around 10 hrs of work.

Oh god how i wanted to see her face...

My manager is awesome so my colleague haven't got any penalty despite she reported him for ""being rude""",talesfromtechsupport

One of the contractors comes up and asks me if these new cameras are for their computers (they are massive PTZ cameras in outdoor enclosures). I was a bit confused, and told her no these were for the building.

She presses again about the computer cameras. I ask her what she means as I follow her to her computer thinking she might be referring to the webcams they video conference with.

t3_c233x2,"""This is unbelievable. We should bring you on as a consultant.""","Not so long ago I temped as an admin assistant at a government department between jobs. I learned a few things in this job. For one thing, people really unfairly value your capability by your job title in the public sector especially. I mean, people really talked to me like I was slow, because I was ""the receptionist"". For another, government sector in this part of town is severely underskilled. The ""sys-admin""  was pretty much a guy who I guess had got the job because he had a lot of opinions about which cellphone brand was best. The IT manager was a 60+ year old woman who...well I don't know what she did. But aside from these things (and the pay), the job was pretty great. Low responsibility, low effort, leave at exactly 5 every day.

One day the Admin Manager came to me with a grim face, like it was my time to do the green mile or something. She announced that she had **The Spreadsheet**, which annually required two weeks worth of data entry and usually got lumped on the admin team. I resigned myself to this. It sounded by her description like thousands of lines of names you had to copy into a database from a handwritten sheet or something. 

She sat me down and showed me what we were looking at. As it turned out, **The Spreadsheet** really was a spreadsheet. And even more curiously, it was already full of data. 

**Her:** So in Column A there is a firstname like John, and in column B there is a surname like Smith. You need to put those into one cell, so all of it is just in Column A, like ""John Smith"".

**Me:** Ok. And what else?

**Her:** Well once you get done with that, there's a postcode you need to take out of the address column F and put into a separate column G. 

**Me:** ....Ok. Is this...is this it?

**Her:** Well yes. But as you can see, there are around five thousand rows, so this will take you a while. If you need help or it's taking too long let me know and I'll see if I can spare you an intern. Oh, but you can copy and paste each entry from one place to the next, you know how to do that right? 

I blinked, and digested what I was looking at. Every year, this particular government department paid someone a living wage for 2 weeks or so to type this information out row by row. They had never employed anyone capable or asked anyone if it could be done another way. 

Obviously when I went back into the admin manager's office with a finished spreadsheet an hour later (my excel formulas are a bit rusty), she was gobsmacked, and uttered the line from the title. I felt impressive, until I pinched myself.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_c2bjkx,Even Experienced Technicians Forget the Golden Rule.,"This story wrapped up today, spanned 2-3 weeks, and ends in glory!  
**Diz**-Your humble narrator  
**Pooh**-Another Tech I met briefly... he reminded me of someone.   
**Key-Holder**... you guessed it.  
**BossMan** My senior. Not a technical guy, but well meaning.  

*I'm a humble government contractor just trying to make a buck and help my DND. The problem was with a certain cryptographic device, and the software interface not saving a piece of data... I'm not entirely authorized to work on said piece of gear... but since when is that new. We open on a Monday*

&gt; **Diz**: Hey BossMan I see the Tech's are in there plugging away at the crypto. Same problem as last time?  
&gt; **BossMan**: It still seems like it won't save. This is the third time they've shown up, and they are starting to get pissed. They say the device is broken.  

*I pop my head into the room in question.*  

&gt; **Diz**: Hey Pooh, and Key-Holder, how's it going this time around?  
&gt; **Pooh**: Not good. Exact same problem as last time! The route never saves. See I have the data entered, hit the save button and I.E. just does nothing.  
&gt; **Diz**: That's strange... you've worked on this version before?  
&gt; **Pooh**: No, this is a newer revision but it uses an identical interface. You guys need a new device, and our shop won't come look at this again until it's replaced.  

*Pooh Exits stage left*  
&gt; **Key-Holder**: Don't mind him, they have been at the same issue for weeks. No progress.  
&gt; **Diz**: Understandable, but lets try opening I.E. Developer Tools and see what the page is doing.  

At this point I go to perform the same save operation, and I can clearly see that a break is happening. Looks like some Java Script is trying to pull data from a field that doesn't exist! It should be mentioned, I'm not a Java developer, and I have limited experience with web interface problems... but I know undeclared variables when I see them!... or so I thought.  

&gt; **Diz**: Aha! That looks like the culprit. I bet when *Note-worthy defense company* pushed this new model they just copy-pasted code and it broke the update. I'll E-mail everyone, and see about getting a replacement.  
&gt; **Key-Holder**: Sounds good, let me know how it goes.  

At this point, I was 95% convinced someone copy-pasted some code badly. I E-mailed a lot of people, open some support tickets and started the procurement of an older model device as it needed to be working sooner rather than later. The defense got back to me with the same old ""Did you try clearing the browser cache?"", to which I replied ""And what good would that do us!?"". Another tech in another facility had tried 2-3 different browsers, and various OSs with no success... these devices were garbage!

Fast-forward about a week to present time. I'd been re-imaging a machine for another purpose. The device we were accessing required a stand-alone fresh workstation to connect into it... which I now had! I decide to try poking around in the error to see if I could cobble together a better report for the support ticket.  


*Diz fires up the workstation, sets the static IPs. Navigates to the correct page.*  
&gt; **Diz**: Might as well clear the cache, even though It's been tried a million times.  
*Clears cache. Clicks save. Route saves... Route saves??¿?!1*

I then promptly called Key-Holder, told him the good news and asked him to swing by with some crypto  

*Key-Holder Enters*  
&gt; **Diz**: Here, watch this.  

*Pushes and saves route*  

&gt; **Key-Holder**: Hot damn it works! Let me get the Key-Mat and we'll fire this puppy up tonight!  

*Boss-Man Enters after we push the key-mat and everything is green*  

&gt; **BossMan**: Diz, I don't know what you guys are doing, but the VoIP devices are connected, and everything looks good. How did you get this working? What did you do different?  
&gt; **Diz**: Well I spun in a circle, clapped twice and stroked the machine while whispering nicely to it.  

Then went off 3-4 E-mails to various agencies essentially saying... hey during some testing it started working. Sooooo, don't do anything and have a nice week!  
  
I had forgotten the golden rule of it's never the equipment it's always the user. Even if that user is another technician! Who know's why it started working... I blame PFM.

t3_c26dtn,PC Installs Shouldn't Take 6 hours.,"  

I work for a company that does remote IT management for other companies. 

So I got a ticket/work order to go set up a new workstation at a client on the other side of town. A new Dell OptiPlex 7040 and two new 24” widescreen monitors. Easy stuff. I usually bill 1 hour for these types of installs and I can complete them usually faster than 1 hour. Today, I ran into an unforeseen variable. We’ll call that variable $BitchAssUser. 

So, $BitchAssUser tells me upon my walking in “I thought you were going to be here yesterday?” in a very rude tone of voice. Mind you, the ticket hit my system at 7am today while I was still in bed. My tablet dinged with the notification that the parts had arrived in the warehouse. I got up, showered, went to work, grabbed the parts, and made it to the client’s location in 90 minutes flat. 8:30am standing in her office with no coffee and a day of time to spare.

I removed her current set up which was some old-ass monitors with a Dell Latitude laptop sitting there. I think it was like an old E6230 or something like that. Her desk was a cluster-fuck of a rat nest. I removed all that stuff and she wanted to clean the dust out from behind her monitors. Which is fine, she can do that. I would have done it for her but she beat me to it. So I moved out her way for her to do that to her liking. I installed her tower and positioned her monitors and started to work on the software side of things. Then she started her bullshit. 

$BitchAssUser decided to state to me “I don’t like how this is set up. Can you rewire this so it’s neater?”. Now mind you, it was miles neater than it was when I found her desk. She said she wanted the tower on the floor and then hurried out to a mandatory company wide safety meeting. Now the wires aren’t that long so I had to pull them tight around the corner of the bottom of the desk to reach up to the monitors. The mouse was wireless and the keyboard was wired, so it wasn’t as bad as it could have been, but it was still bad. It was painful to get on my hands and knees under this giant desk and get all these wires neatly in place. So I do this and started working with $CoWorker1 and $CoWorker2 to install the proprietary software for her job function. Some… account management software. 

As we are working on that $BitchAssUser comes back into the office from her safety meeting and pulls her filing cabinet back that was on the side of her desk, right where I ran the wires. Now when I say “pulls the filing cabinet back” what I mean is that she **RIPPED IT FROM THE WALL** with the fury of 10,000 suns. This pulled all the wires from the tower, unplugged countless shit, pulled the monitors across the desk and turned off the PC where $CoWorker2 was remoting in and configuring some registry entries pertaining to software activation. 

$BitchAssUser then proceeds to say “Oh this won’t work. Can you rewire this better?” and my initial response was “How often to you WrestleMania-style remove your filing cabinet from it’s home like that?” She didn’t like that response at all and she then stormed off while saying “Make it better… just make it better”. 

Long story short, I wired her set up the way I wanted it and got a sign-off from her boss (the account manager) and then left after $CoWorker1 and $CoWorker2 finished their end of the work order.

t3_c25h8w,When a database is not a database,"This happened to me about fifteen years ago. I took a temp job at a security badge company one year during the holidays. They were looking for someone to do data entry into a database, but also to figure out why they were losing data from said database. I had a lot of previous experience with Microsoft Access, and the temp agency said Microsoft Access knowledge was a requirement for the position, so I figured it'd be easy enough to figure out. It was explained to me that it was temp-to-hire and the pay was better than my last couple jobs, plus I was unemployed at the time, so I figured I'd give it a shot even though the job description wasn't really in my preferred line of work.

I go in the first day and they show me the database. A database it was not. It was an Excel spreadsheet. They would enter data into a macro form and the macro would insert a new row at the top of the ""Data"" sheet. It took me all of five minutes to realize what the problem was. The ""Data"" sheet was completely full to Excel 97's old 65,535 row limit, so each time the macro would run the last record in the sheet would get bumped off and be lost forever.

I brought this to the attention of the people in charge and explained to them how with a couple days of work I could migrate this to an Access database and solve their problem. They thanked me, told me to continue using it as it was, then fired me over the weekend. Apparently, giving them a workable solution was a fireable offense...?

Teacher: Acrobat I think. I'm not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm thinking....is he not signed into Creative Cloud properly? Did I forget to activate his account? I'm running through the possible fail points when I get to his computer and he shows me the ""popup"".

&amp;#x200B;

Teacher: See? This keeps popping up like this and I can't get it to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

I look at the screen and I see Adobe Acrobat, open. No account popups, no activation errors. Just Acrobat. Then I notice the icon bounce in the dock. Then it dawns on me. The user logged in, Acrobat automatically opened because it had been open before, and now was trying to simply be open and acknowledged for being open.

I clicked on File &gt; Close Program and closed the program.

&amp;#x200B;

Teacher: THANK YOU! I couldn't get it to go away. It kept popping up every time I was trying to search the internet.

I just smiled and went back to work, shaking my head and laughing to myself.

t3_c248k4,The worst kind of user,"This user has quite the history with our techs. Basically, she doesnt know basic computer skills. Every time she calls I can feel myself losing brain cells the longer I am on the phone with her.

Her usual phone calls consist of misplaced files, unpinning the ribbon in word, accidentally zooming in on a document and she needs to be set back to the right size, typing so much that her keyboard wares out. You know, nothing too awful. 

The problem isnt so much that she doesnt know how to use a computer. I can deal with users that dont know how to use a computer. The problem is that she is...high strung to put it nicely.  Constantly panics whenever she misplaces a file as if her life is on the line. Always acting like the world is going to end. Asking literally every five seconds if we are able to fix whatever it is she broke this time. Before we even have the chance to remote into her computer to help her she has at least 3 separate panic attacks. (This takes all of 30 seconds to connect to her computer)

But this time...This time takes the cake with her. She called up in a panic like usual. And I'm thinking here that she probably just misplaced a file again. This should take all of 10 seconds to fix. But no. Not this time. This time she had me almost banging my head against the wall to forget this one.  This time she asked me how to copy and paste a file from one folder to another folder. So at first I told her all she needs to do is drag the file from the folder she currently has it in, and drag it to the folder she wants it in. Simple right? I wish. She didnt know what I mean by click and drag. So I show her. I click on the file she needs to move, and slowly drag it across her screen to the folder she needs it in. She still doesnt get it. Eventually I have to have her write down instructions on how to hold down a mouse button and move the mouse to the folder she needs to move files to. She turned what shouldnt have even been a phone call into a 5 minute explanation on how to move a file around on a computer. All the while panicking that she cannot get this task done.

Please, dont be this user. Its fine if you dont know how to use a computer thats why I am here. But dont have multiple panic attacks every time something isnt immediately fixed within microseconds of me answering the phone. It helps no one and only piles on stress to both you and the tech you are talking to. The sky isnt going to fall because you misplaced a file. the world isnt going to end because you dont know how to move a file from one folder to another. Just... dont panic.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c1sg71,What is it with office people and heaters?,"Brief one from today. Since teams changed, I'm still the sysadmin, but I now officially belong to the Operations team, which is mostly admin of the office. This is fine by me, as basically anything that uses electricity within the building winds up being my responsibility anyway. Today is no exception.

We sublet our ample office space to another startup company. Generally there's some crossover in our work setups - we both use Slack heavily, both cloud, both employing lots of technical people. We set up a shared Slack channel to coordinate things like deliveries, visitors and office needs between the two companies. An ongoing project has been to gain full control of the air conditioning in the office, because a bizarre hybrid setup is in place. People in the sublet are aware that ACs are my responsibility.

Around lunchtime today, there's a Slack message from the office manager of the sublet:

&gt;$OM: Help, the AC over the main door is blowing hot air!

The sublet has the ground floor while we have the upper floor. Also, there are partition walls dividing up the shared space.

&gt;$me: hey $OM, do you mean the main glass doors to the street? Because that's not an AC, that's a curtain fan heater   
&gt;  
&gt;$OM: yes that door. it's far too hot!   
&gt;  
&gt;$me: switch it off then :)

I thought that was that. However, 2 hours later, our company office manager walks back into the office after visiting a shop in town:

&gt;$OOM: I seriously cannot believe how hot it is downstairs, it's like a sauna! I had to show $OM how to turn the fan off!   
&gt;  
&gt;$me: wait, what, I told them about this *two hours ago*. You mean they've had the heating pumping into their office space for hours on a summer day?   
&gt;  
&gt;$OOM: Yeah, $OM did mention they'd talked to you earlier, but they didn't do anything about it...

Seriously, how can I make it clearer?",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c1yzt6,In the guise of a user - Part 1,"Preface: Mods, please remove if it's not suitable for the sub. My motivation for sharing is because it was fun to write and might be interesting. A tale from techsupport, not being techsupport, but reciving it? Something like that.  

 
This is not your normal techsupport tale, rather it's one where the heroine will play the role of the ever wandering user - a creature ever lost, ever ignorant and ever unwilling to learn. At least about some things...  

 
The cast!  

 
Quell_in_a_shell - Me! Soup Savant  
The Caretaker - Master of cheap sunglasses  
Captain Balcony - Does balconys and floors. I think.  
General Electric - Possibly an electrician!  


Supporting roles:  


Rex - The furball BFF you didn't even know you had...  
Skugga - May or may not be a shadow or mere trick of the mind... or a cat  

  
Roles are set, now for the stage: Like many of you at MSPs, you almost never sit in a single position. I for one make and solve large infrastructures stuff, like servers or the passion of passions: virtualization. When I'm not stoking that flame of my heart, I manage the helpdesk and provide internal support to the rest of my collegues. I essentially work, eat, sleep. In that order. My work/life balance is not very good. Not at all. Overworked and overstressed.

 
Thusly, yesterday: The week before the holidays start kicking off and every manager in region want their specific issue they have told us about fixed before friday. So I spend most of my day in the car and on the phone - my mind and body just a stitched together mix of exhaustion and annoyance, dressed to look like a human.
After a particularly grueling visit in person to a client, I'm finally able to go home. Rolling down roads, beset on either side by mountains and lakes - I finally started to relax somewhat. Being closer to the holidays, things in town was chaotic. I park, do my shopping, return home and realize two things:

 
One, the cats had to stay in the living room all day because of the working being done on the balcony. They wanted out.
Two, it's rather quiet, isn't?

 
I fed the cats, strolled around giving up small, non specific prayers to any deity listening for the mess I live in and the workers on balcony has to see; while attempting to clean. Cats fed and now complaining they couldn't go out on the balcony I decided to make myself some soup. While it was heating up I ventured into my livingroom sat down and logged in. Except it didn't happen. It was one of those odd little moments of muscle memory and human expectation working in tandem to create the illusion of me waking my computer, login and staring at the desktop. The screens were dark. Everything was dead.

 
""What have you two done?"" I asked the cats and started checking the outlets. The results very odd. Two of three outlets worked. None of the outlets in the bedroom worked. And my washing machin was now just a dead god, now rumble or tumble left to give.
""This isn't you, is it?"" I queried the larger of the cats. He headbutted my leg. ""Probably not.""  

 
At this point, I was against bothering to look deeper into this. I was exhausted. I honestly just wanted to eat and then sleep, the issues for this Quell_in_a_shell relegated to her future self. Years of experience and habit wouldn't let it go.
I started checking fuses. I started replacing fuses. I pulled out equipment, reset the mains and still nothing. I know enough about eletrical system to manage load and capacity, but I'm not a proffesional - rather a dangerous idiot to be honest.
I also knew the eletricals in the build was very old... 


Time to spread the pain around. I walked down the stairs and knocked on the door of the building caretaker, a rather nice middle-aged man. I don't feel he is a bad person, but like many men he has tendency to take charge and ignore what I say, since I'm a woman.
This could work to my advantage, since I wasn't in any shape to be useful beyond physically moving my body from point to point and answering in the affirmative or negative. 


No indeed, this time I would slip into the guise of the user!

 
""Sorry to disturb you, but the lights are out in some of my flat. Checking and replacing the fuses doesn't help. Do you have any idea?"" I said. He frowned.  
""Oh that's strange. Just let me get the keys and we'll check the switchboard."" Poking around there we found nothing out of the ordinary, even checking the old diazed fuses. We wandered to another box with more fuses. Nothing there either.  
""Could I check the fuses in your flat?"" he asked me.  
""Of course."" I said.  

 
Muttering to himself, he now went through the same series of troubleshooting steps I had, and informed him about. All the while the largest of my cats kept headbutting him in the knee - emitting a sound not unlike that of a industrial grade sewing machine.
""Wasn't Captain Balcony doing work here today?"" he asked retorically.  
""Sure.""  
""He's up in the other building, I'll fetch him. I thought I heard him mention that he blew one of your fuses."" I watched him leave. The insides of my head contained three voices, battling to be heard. One said: ""Soup!"", the second said ""Sleep!"" and the third said: ""This is rather interesting...""  

 
The caretaker and Captain Balcony arrived a few minutes later. This time going through the exact same troubleshooting steps from before. The captain asked:  
""It works everywhere except your living room and bedroom?""  
""Part of the living room, yes. And the washing machine."" I motioned to the living room and he followed along. I flipped on the lights in the cealing which worked and then put a simple lamp in the ailing outlet to demonstrate it was dead.  
I noticed here, his eyes wasn't as much on the lamp as it was on my desk by the outlet. My computer equipment looks expensive and was. He started sweating.  
""But how could this happen? I put the angle grinder into the outlet in the kitchen!"" he said.  
""I don't know."" I said flatly. Because I didn't.  
""I'll call General Electric, he's an electrician."" Well, he did try and call him, but got no response. ""I'm going to get a lot of flack for this..."" he muttered to himself when he hung up.  
""Not from me. Stuff happens and as long as it's fixed, it's alright."" I said, knowing full well the feeling of find yourself straddling the jaws of a shark when you moments before hadn't even been near a body of water.  


My soup was getting lonely and my other cat, small and shy that she is, was probably having a melt down with all the people in the appartment.  
""I'll stuff the cats into the living room tomorrow, and you can come by and do the troubleshooting you have to. I'm mostly interested in soup and sleep at the moment.""  
""First I'd like to test a few different fuses..."" Captain Balcony said, frowning deeply. He ran out and returned a few minutes later, caretaker in tow with more fuses. I watched with mild interest as lights flicker on and off in the kitchen.  
""Will it be alright if we come in tomorrow?"" he finally asked, the last of his fuses returned to his pocket.  
""Sure.""  
""Will you manage till then?"" the caretaker asked. I shrugged and put on a manic smile.  
""As long as the fridge and feezer works, I'll be alright. I'm just happy it'll get fixed sooner or later""  
""Oh. Okay.""  
""We'll check the substation again."" the caretaker said and they wandered away.  
I put on my soup. Spent a few minutes making a ""helpful diagram"" of where the troublesom outlets were. Ate my soup. Added an apoligy about the mess to my diagram. On second thought I made a little cat doodle too.  


Hopefully an actual electrician can sort this out today. I am oddly content to have problem that is beyond my power to solve or have to pay for...

t3_c1syna,"You can go, we got it working. Oh wait.","I supported my local library when I worked for a nearby MSP, and the little old lady brigade over there was something special. One day they call in and say the internet isn't working. I live nearby enough that I am aware of an ISP outage earlier in the morning, and that it should be back online by now. I drop an appointment in my schedule to go onsite and figure that I'll get to eat lunch at home when I'm done before hopping back over to the office.

OL1-2 = Old Ladies 1 and 2.

Me: Are you guys still having an outage?

OL1: No, we got it sorted out. Sorry you drove over.

Me: Did it just come back on by itself? I should have figured it would.

OL2: You know, we actually went back and tried to fix it before we called, but then we finally got it while you were on your way over.

Me Internally: \*Alarm Bells\*

Me: Mind if I go back and take a look?

OL1: No no no, you don't need to. We don't have the budget for you to spend time on us for no reason. It's working now.

OL1: BYE NOW

So I head out to the company car and get ready to head out, but then OL2 comes huffing and puffing out after me.

OL2: Our wifi is out still! Can you come back in and take a look for us. Sorry!

So I go back and head to the closet. What I believe happened is that they went back and rebooted some random boxes to try to get the internet back when the ISP was out, then the two of them continued to fiddle with things until it started working again. What I'm about to describe to you is 100% truthful and accurate.

Data was coming in on a DSL line.  
The modem was connected to the internal LAN side of the main switch.  
Cable from the main switch connected to the 3rd LAN interface on the router.  
Cable from the 2nd LAN interface on the router connected to the LAN side of the PoE injector for the wifi AP.  
Cable from the powered side of the PoE injector connected to the public computer VLAN side of the switch. (Found out why the wifi was out.)  
Cable from the public VLAN connected to the WAN interface on the router.  
Cable from the 1st LAN interface on the router rightfully connects to the LAN side of the switch.

And that is how their internet was back up. The ISP's modem won't accept traffic from anything with a different MAC than the router's WAN interface unless you reboot it, so data was able to flow through the whole plate of spaghetti and feed their checkout machine on the internal LAN. Can you imagine a couple 70 year old ladies side by side in the doorway of the closet, unplugging and plugging at random? I can't believe they got it working at all and they were actually pretty close to having wifi too.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c1ib00,"Tales from University Helpdesk: ""No, that's protected by FERPA""","Background: Ferpa, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, prevents me from giving out information on students to anyone who isn't that student. Doesn't matter if that student is a minor, if the requester is paying that student's tuition, etc.

It also means I can't ask anything of the student either to verify their ID. So when a **$StudentUser** calls in needing a password reset, and they've opted in to FERPA protection, I cannot ask for things like their mailing address, non $university email, registered phone number, etc. For that, I'll have to transfer them to the office of Admissions and Records/Registrar, where they can waive that protection, the Registrar updates the user's file to remove the flag, and then half an hour later the updates have propagated to the systems that I have access to. Super easy, and barely an inconvenience /s.

On a weekly basis, I have a user that falls in to one of the above camps. A user that needs a password reset because their parent set up their account for them and selected not to opt out of the FERPA protections calls in:

""Sorry, I am unable to verify your identity, you have FERPA protections on your account which prevents me from asking for any personal information. I'll have to transfer you to the **$University** Registrar, they can remove that flag if you like""

""Can't you just look me up with my SSN/DoB/Student ID?""

""In order to comply with Federal Privacy regulations, I cannot ask for that information. You have that flag on your account, it needs to be removed in order for me to be able to pull up the information that would let me verify your identity""

Generally then, they let me transfer it. It's not fun, especially since there's been some back and forth with the $Registrar over what challenge questions we can ask, and what needs to be transferred to them.

Occasionally, we get a helicopter parent trying to get into their kids' **$MyUniversity** dashboard, which is where you register for classes, pay fees/tuition, access grades and unofficial transcripts, etc. etc. This would also give them access to their kids' **$University** email account. Even if the student is a minor (17 year olds can take courses at $university), we cannot and will not grant someone claiming to be their parent a password reset unless the actual user is there answering the challenge questions.

**$NotUser**: ""Hi, I need a password reset for **$useraccount""**

**$HD**: ""Okay, let's check, no FERPA flag present. Can I get your Student ID?""

**$NotUser**: ""Oh, I don't have their ID. I'm $Parent""

**$HD**:""Is the student there?""

**$NotUser**: ""No, but I need to get in to their account""

**$HD**: ""Call us back when $Student is present. Due to Federal Privacy regulations, I cannot grant access or give out any information for that student's account, if **$Student** is present, then *they* can request a pw reset, if they need one.""

**$NotUser**: ""Okay, hold on one second""

**$NotUser**: ""**$SONSNAME**!!! Come over here, tell the man for me that you need to change your password!""

at this point the phone's been put on speaker by the caller, TV in the background is audible.

**$User**: ""Password to what, mom?""

**$NotUser**: ""The school!""

**$User:** ""Ma, I know my password.""

Line is silent for a few seconds.

HD, chiming back in ""So, you don't need a password reset to access **$user**'s account then?""

""No, bye"" as the son is heard going ""Mom what the-"" and the line goes dead.

edit 2: Electric Boogaloo: Just to clarify, The above is relatively rare, and I pared this down so that you don't have to read twenty minutes worth of ""But can't you look it up by SSN? I'm his mother! What do you mean, 'no'?!, how about his DoB and Address?"". We handle a metric fuckton of callers, and students aren't able to waive FERPA protections, they just have the option (most opt out when they sign up) to have no one but the University Registrar and persons that the student themselves specify as having viewing rights on their account. The problem arises when the student needs to prove they are who they say they are over the phone, and I'm not allowed to look at certain information, or confirm the correctness of the information provided to me by the user. Even if the user doesn't have that flag, the Registrar's office has determined that HelpDesk can't ask for certain PII from any student in ANY situation. As I said below:

&gt;The  above is mainly how it impacts my job, and it really isn't that much of  a hassle 90+ percent of the time. And we do need to protect users from  helicopter parents vigilantly, as there is no way to distinguish an  overly concerned parent from some phisher or other ne'er-do-well over  the phone.  
&gt;  
&gt;We've had a few instances  where stalkers/abusers etc tried to use the above route to get into a  user's account and when that happens, or the user alerts us that they  have that issue, we help them through locking their shit down, going  through their account for anyone that has been added on as having been  granted access (students with special needs often have a parent or  assistant granted such access rights), etc, then we refer those users to  $university police  
&gt;  
&gt;The biggest headaches  comes from the turf wars between helpdesk and the registrar over  whether we're allowed to ask for student ID or if we have to refer users  to them, and also training faculty and staff that have access to  student records basic infosec for FERPA compliance.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c1c83v,We unknowingly helped someone commit a crime,"This happenned a few years ago. I work as tech support for a company that sells access control, alarm and video surveillance products. I'm on the phone all day, helping installers with any technical issue they could have with our products. We're only 3 on support calls, so we end up knowing everyone that calls on a regular basis.


There was a very nice old man that was calling us about 2-3 times a week. He was very polite, funny and patient. He was probably in his late 60s judging by the voice and the way he talked. His questions were always about cameras or recorders.


 He was asking very basic stuff like how to record, getting his cameras online, changing the resolution, connecting remotely, etc. He had no knowledge of basic ipv4 networking or cctv. I didn't think much of it because on rare occasion we would help end users (we're a tech support line for technicians and integrator only). This went on for about two months until he stopped calling us. 


After a year of him not calling us, my colleague said ""You guys remember (first name+last name) ? It's has been a while since he called, I wonder what he's up to.""


So we googled his name and... It turns out he was the owner of a gym in a small town, and he was arrested for filming and recording the women locker room and showers. And we had pretty much walked him through the whole installation and configuration of the camera system, never knowing what he was doing with it.

t3_c1f7vz,"Telephone line, give me some time","This is a short, sad story that happened to one of my colleagues, he gifted me the rights, but instead of making a movie out of it, I decided to just post it on TFTS.

&amp;#x200B;

**Context**: We work for an MSP, and currently we are working on a customer project to unify connectivity and configuration on all their locations (&gt;30 throughout the whole country): installing firewalls, setting up dual ISP internet connectivity, configuring tunnels between each location and their HQ, and dealing with the pain in the butt that can be a project of this size with all the parties involved.

&amp;#x200B;

A guy from this customer's IT department (we'll just call him Guy) called, my colleague (let's name him Bob) took the call and it was something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

Bob: Good evening, \[REDACTED\], this is Bob, how can I help you?

Guy: Hi, it's Guy from Customer, the phones at location B aren't working, I'm calling from location A and it's failing.

Bob: Okay, let me log in and take a l-

Guy: I'm in a hurry right now, please fix it. *hangs up*

&amp;#x200B;

Without any more information, Bob started investigating. Tunnels from both locations towards HQ were up, nothing seemed wrong when checking the traffic and system logs, security rules were correct, NAT, routes, DNS, VLANs, you name it, everything looked perfectly okay on the locations and HQ. Before blaming it on faulty phones, Bob asked on the company chat if someone knew more about SIP so they could help him. I am no expert, but I learned from a previous customer case that SIP ALG can sometimes cause issues, so I passed him some documentation, it was a blind shot but there was no harm in trying. Bob toggled the setting and pushed the change to the firewalls.

&amp;#x200B;

After more than an hour of investigating and getting filled with despair for not seeing anything, he called the customer back (thanks, Call History, you're a life saver), and again, conversation was pretty short

&amp;#x200B;

Bob: Hi, Guy, it's Bob from \[REDACTED\]. I have changed some settings, can you see if it works now?

Guy: Sorry I didn't call you again, but I think that the phone was actually working, it was just that no one was there to pick it up, thanks. *hangs up*

Bob reverted the change, and started thinking which whiskey would he drink that night. The customer never called back about this.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c19v8j,Sometimes you can do something wholesome!,"Disclaimer: Working as Level 1 TS, usually only via phone + email. No Remote/TeamViewer sessions, unless we deem it absolutely necessary (which basically means 'never', as our supervisors generally try to avoid any remote session).

&amp;#x200B;

**Now here's the story:**

Elderly customer phones in, having a quite diffuse problem with issues all over the place.

He's quite nice and understanding,  but I soon realize he has trouble following the simplest instructions (""click on start, click on control panel"" etc.).

After 45 minutes it's clear we're not getting anywhere with this and I also need to save time (fuck average handling time).

I tell him that I'll send him some step-by-step instructions via email. I promise I'll phrase them in the easiest way possible and advise that he should try to get someone to help him carry out the instructions (locally).

The instructions include things like how to take a screenshot of any errors, finding a log file etc. etc. and then sending these to us via email.

I don't have much hope, but there's not much I can do and elderly customers aren't super uncommon in our call center. Sometimes you just have to send them written instructions where they can see everything black on white, and then let them experiment on their own.

A day later, the customer phones back, he found one(!) log file but doesn't know how to send us the file.

I spend about half an hour explaining how to attach a file to an email. He's very friendly and apologizes for his incompetence, mentioning that he's 90 years old and that he has had a hard day, coming from chemo and that he doesn't have very long to live, that he just wants to write some letters to his friends and family before he 'leaves' (he phrased it like this).

He then thanked me for my support and told me he'll try sending the file again later because he felt very tired right in that moment. Call ends.

I've had to deal with quite a number of cancer patients in my life, actually, but this guy still managed to find my soft spots.

Next day, I receive an email from him. One file attached (I asked for 4), so I open it up - it's a Word document called  something like ""msinfo32letterflyanair"", so I guess he tried to save his System Info file but probably messed it up and did something else.

I was right - when I opened it I saw that it's an actual Word document with a letter to a flight company. The letter was basically a request to cancel his flight about half a year down the line as he was to weak to travel and probably wouldn't even make it that long.

Reading that accidentally sent letter, I decided that this guy was THE exception my supervisors always mentioned when we talked about TeamViewer.

I asked about it, actually got the request authorized, and then managed to schedule an appointment for the session with the customer.

&amp;#x200B;

I helped him setup TeamViewer, which was another call of about 30mins, and then my supervisor started the remote session. In the meanwhile, I had to stay on the phone with the customer, instructing him on any required steps (supervisor didn't speak the same language).

Supervisor then finds some issues, performs some steps, and lastly performs a reinstall of the customers Office pack. While the installation is running, I figure I should do some small talk with the customer to cover the waiting time. We had built quite a relationship by now, so in between I asked:

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""So, how's today? Is it another tired day?""

Customer: ""Yes, my wife and me figured it's a nice birthday gift, somehow.""

Me:  (smiling) ""That's one way to see it! Are you doing anything else today or are you taking it easy?""

Customer: ""Just having our kids and grandchildren over later. We'll have some cake and coffee and chat a bit. Nothing big.""

Me: ""That's nice! I also think we're done soon, let me just have a quick look..."" \[checking status of reinstall - supervisor just finishing up and giving me a nod\] ""Actually, that's us finished now. You can try now if you like. Let's hope you like this present.""

Customer:  \*tests his software, everything works\* ""This is amazing. Thank you so much. This is the best birthday gift you could ever give me!""

Needless to say, it was a happy day for both him and me. Just had to share this story as I still like to think back and remember it. :)

t3_c18gch,The Officer Position,"My friend and I work in the US Navy as a general troubleshooters for various gear. We were underway and got a trouble call to the bridge. The call was for some ancillary thing and was resolved quickly. While up there, my friend(F) got waved over by the Officer of the Deck (OOD) to answer some questions and give some training on a radar display console. The display is nothing special, it just gives various composite pictures of what the numerous radars on board see. The power switch is, like most, labeled in large letter ON and OFF. After asking questions about several of the other dials and switches, he points at the power switch and we get this gem.

OOD: What does this switch do?

F: That? It switches between the enlisted and officer settings.

OOD: What’s the difference?

F: Not much, it just switches over to a sharper, more defined video.

OOD: Really? 

*hits the switch*

*the screen turns off*

OOD: you knew this was going to happen.

F: Yes.

OOD: You’re going to have fun telling this story later, aren’t you.

F: Yes.

F then walks off the bridge and proceeds to tell me. Stories like these are a dime a dozen, but we have more stories like these ranging from humorous to aggravating if you guys are interested.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c1cil6,Our website is returning an error message... From someone else's website.,"Not actually tech support, but I once wrote a VBA macro and I have permission to edit the website, which most people think is close enough.

I have a colleague who I have found frustrating in the past, but she has recently reached new peaks (depths?) of technological breakdown. We recently remodeled one of our web pages, and she messaged me asking about some information that was previously on the page but no longer available. Using my initiative, I found an archive from the Way Back Machine and passed it on to her with an explanation that this is an archive, and will show what the page used to look like.

A few days later, she sent me another message - ""There is an error on the web page. I get this message when I try to download documents"". She sends a screenshot of the error message, and it is the Wayback Machine error message that basically says this document isn't available. The following conversation ensues:

&gt; That is not the page, it is an archive. Downloadable documents are not archived, but you can get them from the live page by accessing it as usual.

&gt; No, still getting the same error message.

The screenshot is of the Wayback Machine.

&gt; That looks like the archive to me.

&gt; No, it's the normal page.

&gt; You mean **our** web page is returning an error message that says ""Wayback Machine"" at the top?

&gt; Yes.

I realised at this point that I had been unduly ambitious introducing a second website to her on top of our own. When I sent her the specific link to our internal page, she claimed she preferred the other one (ie the archive) because she couldn't find the documents she wanted on our page.

I struggled to think of any response at all that wouldn't be patronising (""let me explain what a URL is...""), so I told her I'd look into it. I haven't heard any further cases of our website returning another company's error messages, so I guess it has fixed itself.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c1cc6n,The wonders of electricity.,"Ok so I served in the army for just over 3 years, working with computers &amp; networks in the army's CC4I corps.
Most of my work was classified, but I did spend a few months being at a helpdesk in a base.
In the base about 5k soldiers are stationed, and in offices and classrooms combined we had a little over 2k computers, so helpdesk platoon had a lot of work (most problems were fixed remotely but we had to go out for network issues and physical/hardware problems).

One night I was in night shift and got a phone call from an officer, stating that his computer does not turn on, after verifying with him that all the cables are properly connected I write down his details into our system, take a spare cable and head out to his office. 

Walking into the building he's in, I noticed the hallway's lights are off, but didn't think too much about it, guessing the battalion might be out in some activity and he just stayed alone to work, I walk into his office, seeing him and another soldier holding their phones with the flashlight on, above the desk (the room is dark).

Me: so you called about the computer not powering up?

Officer: yeah I click the power button and it doesn't work.

Me: (while playing with the light switch, which does nothing), and you didn't think it's because the power might be down?

Officer: (looks at me confused and then looks down at his phone) oh, wait so maybe THAT'S why my phone wasn't charging?!

Me: yeah

t3_c1457f,"""But it's never been anywhere near water!""","I just found out this subreddit exists through one of those ""YouTuber reads reddit posts"" videos. I work at (and manage) a cell phone repair shop in a small town, so I've got some good stories for y'all! (American south, so apply the THICCEST southern accents you can to the customer(s).)

A long time ago, a woman brings in two iPhone 6s wanting the screens swapped. She explains that the screen on one worked, but the other didn't, so she wants the one that did work on the phone with the currently non-working screen. Easy. 

Now if you don't know anything about the iPhone 6s and 6s+, they have a rather huge flaw. The motherboard can, without warning (as well as with various causes), suffer a serious malfunction that messes up the backlight circuit. There are a couple ways to fix this, but we're only just now getting started with motherboard repair because holy F good equipment is expensive. 

Well, as it turns out, that's what was happening... to both of them... only this time I knew the cause: water damage to *both phones*. The conversation that ensued still makes me laugh. (CL will be crazy lady, and I'll be Me)


**Me**: Hi, this is Me from CellPhoneRepairShop calling about your phone.

**CL**: Did y'all get it fixed?

**Me**: Well, not exactly. We have some concerns about the phones.

**CL**: What's wrong?

**Me**: Well it seems that neither phone is in working condition. They both turn on and work, but the screens don't light up due to water damage on the motherboard.

**CL**: *WATER DAMAGE?!*

**Me**: Yes ma'am. The liquid exposure indicators on both phones show exposure to water, and there is corrosion around the screen connections on the board.

**CL**: Well there was no water damage when I brought it in! Y'all must have spilled water on it!

**Me**: That's not how corrosion works, ma'am. It takes hours for it to oxidize this badly.

**CL**: WELL Y'ALL BETTER FIX IT! I NEED MY PHONE!

**Me**: Sorry, ma'am, but there's nothing we can do here. You can come pick them up at any time. 

She never showed up. 

Another amusing anecdote also involves liquid damage. I'll keep it short. Frequent customer comes in because her phone isn't turning on. Open it up to find *standing water* still inside the phone! Didn't tell us that. Clean it up, replace battery, all good. She insisted ""it's never been anywhere near water,"" but whatever. A few weeks later, she comes back it because it's not turning on again. I explain that we can't warranty the battery because of water damage to the phone, and they were okay with it. Open it up to find *standing water* still inside the phone! Wait what? Clean it up, replace battery, all good. 

She comes in to get it, and I tell her about the water in the phone. I kid you not, this poor girl says ""Y'all were supposed to have taken care of that last time!"" Naw, precious, water don't work that way. We tell her this was fresh water, and she again says ""It's never been anywhere near water.""

t3_c15dpi,so you don't want me to call anymore?,"so this is the first time I post on Reddit, so let us say I'm a Reddit virgin.

&amp;#x200B;

I work for a 24/7  service desk who works for a company that has sites all over the world, the main sites are on Spain and UK since we work from America I have the graveyard shift in order to be available for the working hours in Europe.

as a SD tech we do a lot of stuff and if we are unable to fix the problem we send it to an on-site tech, one of the problems that we fix is the connection between computers and network printers, the company we work for only supports 2 brands of printers so the rest of the brands are out of the question we CAN\`T fix those problems and they have to contact the printers tech support in order to fix their problem.

&amp;#x200B;

on day I arrived and was doing my thing  getting calls, fixing problems and then this Karen calls in and I pick up, she tells me she was having problems scanning and that she was talking to another tech before but the call had so much interference she decided to hung up, I asked for the ticket number and she gave it to me, in order to send it to another  resolution group we need some info, and it was on the ticket already but as I was looking through the info I realized it was a canon printer/scanner so I told her that we didn't support those printers and that she should call canons tech support, she went ballistic telling me that they had fixed the same problem before and I needed to help her, I tried my best but without the password to enter the canon server I couldn't do much, I escalated the ticket to the team that is in charge of printer knowing they were going to send it back saying the didn't support that brand.

&amp;#x200B;

the weekend passed and on Monday I got a call and it was this Karen AGAIN,  I saw that canon sent the password to their server and some other tech tried to remap the folder she had for the scans but it still wasn't working, I tried doing that again and waited to see if it worked, and it did, I was so proud of myself (I'm  a med student so I'm not super handy with TI but I know somethings that how I got the job, med school isn't gonna pay itself) we finished the call closed the ticket and I thought that was it, but boy was I wrong, about 2 hours later I get this call I pick up and is Karen again ( for some reason I had the bad luck to get all her calls)  telling me that it wasn't working and that she needed to talk to the girl that fixed it, I told her it was me and she was so happy about it I followed the same steps but it wasn't working, there was a problem with the IP address or something, I told her I couldn't help her and she needed to call canons tech support, she asked to talk to my supervisor, he did the same thing I did, he explained to her that her problem was out of our reach but that we would check it with the company's printers team.

&amp;#x200B;

fast forward to 2 later, we haven't heard from the companies printers tech support, I get a call pick up and chan chan chaaaaaaaaaan IT WAS KAREN AGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIN, she already recognized my voice so she was like hi OP, do you have any information about my ticket and I told her that we were waiting for an answer that she needed to. be patient, that we would contact the team so they could prioritize her ticket but that was everything we could do at the moment, after that it went a little bit like this:

&amp;#x200B;

Karen: so you are telling me you are not going to fix my problem I need it to be fixed in order to work

me: no miss what I'm saying is that we need to wait a little longer to get an answer since this is a printer we don't support we need to be sure how we are going to proceed with your ticket, we are doing everything that is in our hand to help you, but you can help us by calling canon tech support so they can fix it faster.

&amp;#x200B;

Karen: SO YOU ARE TELLING ME NOT TO CALL YOU ANYMORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

me: no ma'am I'm just asking you to please be patient we have your number an as soon as we have some information we will contact you just like you accorded with my supervisor.

&amp;#x200B;

Karen: YOU ARE TELLING ME NOT TO CALL AGAIN, I'M NOT CALLING YOU ANYMORE, I WON'T CALL THE SERVICE DESK ANYMORE,  YOU ARE WORDLESS, USELESS PEOPLE FROM AMERICA, YOU ARE NOTHING.

t3_c1179x,Help someone out and they junk the expensive router you bought them,"I like to be a nice person and decided to help some family out and bought them a nice router. They had WiFi signal issues upstairs and I bought them a dual band netgear nighthawk router with multiple antennas. Set everything up for them and left the passwords.

I knew something was up when a guest needed the password and they couldn’t even see the network but I only visit there a few times a year and it wasn’t important enough to drive out there that day.

Few weeks ago the family member said he couldn’t get into Netflix, which is a shared account between us courtesy of T-Mobile. Gave him the password again and that was the end of that.

Finally made it out there yesterday. I walk in and did a double take when I saw my router missing. Asked and was told by another member that a friend said this new one was better and replaced it. Mine was upstairs, unplugged.

Glanced at it and it’s some cheap belkin. Explained the missing network from the guest two paragraphs above. 

And it explains the Netflix issues. More likely than not the Apple TV I have them for free wasn’t changed to the new network SSID. The old router had the same SSID as mine so when my kids went there their electronics worked. Asked my kid if his iPad worked there, he said no. Confirmed.

Have to see them tomorrow and the Netflix issue will probably come up again. More likely than not they threw out the passwords given them and will want me to fix stuff. I’ll just tell them to use the passwords given them and not waste my time.

t3_c0sear,"""If you can re-wire a plug, you can re-wire a computer, right?""","This tale comes from an encounter with one of my old freelance clients, some years ago.

Your cast of characters:

**$Miscreancy**: A dashing ne'er-do-well, armed with tools and cables, zipping around the city on a motorbike to put out technological fires (occasionally literally!)

**$LadySybilRamkin:** $Miscreancy's darling then-girlfriend, light of his life, font of sarcasm, and occasional reader of his Reddit posts (hello, dear)

**$BloodyStupidJohnson:** The client in question, who often before and sometimes after calling me would try earnestly to fix whatever problem was occurring, which then usually involved him compounding the issues.

The tale begins!

&amp;#x200B;

*Some background - $BloodyStupidJohnson was actually a really nice guy, an accountant by trade who had just gone freelance himself and was struggling to get his computing setup to work. I'd got him set up with a decent laptop, a ""server"" \[desktop tower with Win Server 2012 installed on it, on which $PopularAccountSoftware's server-side software was installed\], and a 2-bay NAS.. The only problem he was that he was exceptionally clueless and managed to break everything he touched by dint of sheer foolishness and overestimation of his technical ability. He paid well and on time though with no quibbles, made an excellent cup of coffee, and on each occasion he messed up he would admit fault and promised he would stop messing around with things he didn't understand, only to go ahead and do exactly that the next time things went wrong. I'd never seen him operate a piece of technology successfully, let alone fix one, but nevertheless, he persisted...*

&amp;#x200B;

\[phone rings\]

&amp;#x200B;

**$Miscreancy:** Hello, this is $Miscreancy.

**$BloodyStupidJohnson:** Yes, this is $BloodyStupidJohnson. I'm sorry to have to call you, is there any chance you could come over and look at my machine? I'm struggling to get into $PopularAccountingSoftware, it said it couldn't connect to the server?

**$Miscreancy:** Alright $BloodyStupidJohnson, we'll walk through the basic troubleshooting and then assess from there. So first of all - go look at the file server. Make sure it's on (there'll be a green light on the front) and then have a look at the back of it - there should be an ethernet cable connected. Check that's in nice and tight.

\[interminable waiting period during which I begin to get worried he's somehow managed to electrocute himself\]

**$BloodyStupidJohnson:** So the cable was plugged in all the way and on so I think it's fine.

**$Miscreancy:** Right-o. And your machine - is that connected to the internet properly?

**$BloodyStupidJohnson:** I think so - I can go on websites and things like that, I just can't get into my accounts.

**$Miscreancy:** Okay - I can probably move a few things around and get to you this afternoon. I'll message you a time.

&amp;#x200B;

*An intermission ensues. You, dear reader, may picture the journey however you wish - perhaps a rugged man in leathers riding a Kawasaki Ninja at high speed on a sunny day across a wind-swept American vista, determination in his eyes. However, I will let you in on the reality, which was a scrawny guy on a cheap 125cc hairdryer-on-wheels struggling through traffic at 30mph through an English city in the wind and rain. Reality is a cruel, drizzle-filled mistress.*

&amp;#x200B;

\[knock on door\]

&amp;#x200B;

**$BloodyStupidJohnson:** Ah, $Miscreancy! I'm glad you could make it here so quickly.

**$Miscreancy:** No problem. So, let's have a quick look at your machine, and then the server. Then I'll get into it and take a look through.

&amp;#x200B;

Machine's fine, all connected, and I can actually remote into the file server from it. He's right though, trying to launch his accounting software gets me all sorts of errors, mainly about not being able to access the data. I immediately smell a hard drive rat.

This particular setup was unusual and - I'll admit - a tiny bit hacky, largely because $BloodyStupidJohnson had a relatively low budget and was allergic to even considering cloud-based options for the accounting software he wanted to use (""It's just not safe, storing these things on the internet!""). I had walked him through his other options and we settled on using a RAID-1 array on a ""server"" for the storage of the accounts data, with a nightly backup to NAS, and a cold storage 'back up the backup to external drive' procedure he followed on the first day of every month.

I take a gander at at the RAID array and sure enough, it's doomed. One disk is completely caput, and it looks like it spouted a load of corrupted data which got mirrored to the other on the way to failing (this is why RAID is not a backup, folks).  $PopularAccountingSoftware is obviously rather unhappy about this. But it's okay, I can fix this in fairly short order. Just need a new disk and then we'll restore from the NAS. The drive's only a year old, but these things happen. Oh well. I check the NAS and sure enough last night's backup is sitting there, winking at me.

&amp;#x200B;

**$Miscreancy:** So, looking at this, one of the hard drives on the server has failed for reasons unknown, and it's been kind enough to send a load of garbage to the other one in the process. That's why $PopularAccountingSoftware isn't working.

**$BloodyStupidJohnson:** Okay. So, how long is this going to take to fix? Am I going to lose anything?

**$Miscreancy:** Well, the actual process won't take very long, we just need to get a replacement disk, install it, and then restore from the backup. It backs up nightly, so you'll only lose anything you've done today.

**$BloodyStupidJohnson:** And how soon can you get replacement disks?

**$Miscreancy:** I can get you one tomorrow for an extortionate price from $LargeComputerStoreChain, or if I tell you the make and model you can put in an order with $ReasonablyPricedCompany and have it delivered here; we'll only need one of them. You let me know when it's delivered, and then I'll arrange to do the install.

&amp;#x200B;

$BloodyStupidJohnson ponders this for a moment, but the money trumped the convenience, and he decided to order the disk online and have it delivered. It was gone 6pm on a Friday at this point so I left him to do so and drove home, confirming the make and model of the disk needed.

Three days pass, and late one evening I get a phone call.

&amp;#x200B;

**$BloodyStupidJohnson:** Hi $Miscreancy. Just to let you know those things have arrived.

**$Miscreancy:** Sorry, $BloodyStupidJohnson - did you say things? We only needed the one!

**$BloodyStupidJohnson:** Well I thought, in case we needed one again - so I ordered a spare.  When can you come and get this done? I'm away for a couple days but I'll be back on Wednesday.

**$Miscreancy:** Wednesday's busy but I can do Thursday afternoon. It shouldn't take very long as the procedure is quite simple. About 80% of the work I'm going to do involves a screwdriver!

&amp;#x200B;

That last sentence pretty much led to what happened the next day, and I do partially blame myself. Had I known then what I know now, I never would have implied to a guy like $BloodyStupidJohnson that sometimes solving an IT-related problem essentially boils down to wielding a screwdriver and then some not-particularly-difficult computer stuff. Don't get me wrong, it is **absolutely** true, but the suggestion to some middle-aged men who consider themselves ""handy"" that this is in any way a job for tools will inspire an attempt to resolve this themselves, usually without checking with someone who knows what they're doing. Instead they'll leverage the anonymity of internet browsing, search something they **think** is what they need to do but is in fact unrelated, find a video that they **think** shows them how to do it, and execute it in great haste, breaking loose all hell.

All hail the YouTube tutorial, breaker of systems, deliverer of headaches. In a perfect world, technological advice would only be delivered to people who can use a search engine with sufficient specificity as to ensure the instructions actually match what the user is attempting.

Anyway, I digress. Days passed, life went on and Wednesday rolled around. $LadySybilRamkin-Vimes had gone gallivanting internationally, leaving me free that evening to eat food she would disapprove of, stay up playing video games, and then wake up on the couch at 5am to discover our two cats and one dog had decided I make an excellent mattress, before administering caffeine and heading out to work. My day was not going well (the usual idiocies), but at 2pm I rolled up to $BloodyStupidJohnson's home, ready to rock.

&amp;#x200B;

\[door knock\]

&amp;#x200B;

**$BloodyStupidJohnson:** \[looking suspiciously cheerful\] Afternoon! Come on in!

**$Miscreancy:** Hello! So, I'll just grab the disks and then I can get started. Restoring from the backup should be the most tedious part of the process but hopefully it'll be fairly swift.

**$BloodyStupidJohnson:** Well, I thought I'd lend a hand, so I've gone ahead and swapped the disks out for you. After all, I can handle anything that just needs a screwdriver; I'll leave the complicated stuff to you though. If you can re-wire a plug,  you can re-wire a computer, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, that's right. He, disaster man, killer of machines, has gone ahead and started on his own. I believe this is the moment I contemplated just turning around and leaving.

&amp;#x200B;

**$Miscreancy:** Oooookay, $BloodyStupidJohnson. Do you want to walk me through exactly what you've done so I know where we're up to?

**$BloodyStupidJohnson:** Yep - so I powered down the server last night, and then unscrewed and swapped both disks out in the little trays. I've not powered it back up yet though.

**$Miscreancy:** Alright. I would have advised you to wait, just to be sure, but let's go take a look.

&amp;#x200B;

Had he simply swapped both the healthy and dying disk in the Windows Server RAID array out for healthy disks, while it was powered off, we'd actually be okay. I relaxed for a moment, then realised he'd used another plural. Trays. The desktop running the server had three mounted disks in two bays. So I figure he's swapped out the OS disk for a blank disk, and one of the RAID array's disks, and that's still fine - he hasn't tried to boot it, it's offline, and it was powered off during the change. I can swap the system disk back in, or worst case, reinstall stuff. It'll be a much longer day but I can cope with that.

We're heading to the area the server is stored in, and I notice that the front light is on. So the server is powered up. Then I see that the NAS is off, and next to it lies a tell-tale screwdriver. He has swapped out the disks in the wrong server. But again, while powered off. This shouldn't be fatal. I can still fix this. This is what I keep telling myself, while I try to phrase what I have to say next diplomatically.

&amp;#x200B;

**$Miscreancy:** I'm right in thinking this \[the NAS\] is the server you've done this on? \[he nods\] Unfortunately it's the wrong server. This is the NAS, where we store the backups. The desktop down there is the Windows server with the broken disk. But it's okay; it sounds like you did everything correctly, so replacing the new disks with the old ones in here should bring it back up no problem-

**$BloodyStupidJohnson:** But I thought you said the broken disks were in the server? That's not a server, it's just a computer!

**$Miscreancy:** A server **is** just a computer, one that runs differently to a computer you or I might use, but still a computer. Usually a fancy, expensive one with really expensive components. But for your use case, we didn't need that, so we're using a normal one with normal components. But as I said, it's not a problem. If you can grab the disks you removed, we can swap them back in, then take down the Windows server, and proceed as planned.

&amp;#x200B;

$BloodyStupidJohnson's face has fallen while I explain this to him.

&amp;#x200B;

**$BloodyStupidJohnson**: Well, the thing is, I had to do some computer safety training back when I worked for $LargeAccountingFirm, and they said that if you have an old computer or disk you're getting rid of you shouldn't just bin it or recycle it straight off. They said \[my jaw starts the process of dropping as I begin to comprehend where this is going\] that you need to destroy it, either by unscrewing it and shredding it or if you don't have a shredder, they said in a pinch you can go at it for a while with some nails and a hammer and make sure the disk inside gets smashed up. \[For the pedants - yes, this was HDD, not SSD; it was years ago and he was touchy about paying the extra so I didn't push it.\] I figured you'd know where to recycle them and stuff but I'd make sure no one could get anything off it just in case before I handed it over. I didn't have any nails, so I drilled a couple of screws into the disks and then went at them with a hammer. They got pretty smashed up...

**$Miscreancy:** And you did that to both of them?

**$BloodyStupidJohnson:** Yeah. But we can still get my accounts back, right?

&amp;#x200B;

The hopeful look in $BloodyStupidJohnson's eyes sadly does nothing to soothe the rage I'm feeling, particularly when he shows me the two drives. He drilled all the way through the platters, inserted screws, then hit them repeatedly and by the looks of it extremely hard. The end result is a clear indication that he has some repressed rage, because they now resemble something that might win a Turner prize. I take a moment to recover some cool before replying.

&amp;#x200B;

**$Miscreancy:** ... erm. Well, actually, no, not really. I mean I can, but it'll be the backup to the external hard drive from the 1st of the month. It's the 22nd now, so you're going to lose quite a lot of this month's work. And we need another hard disk. And I'll need to reinstall the NAS software. I can get you up and running the accounts software with the data from three weeks ago today, but you'll have to do manual backups onto the external hard drive nightly until I can get the NAS on, and we need a replacement disk for that, so it'll be another couple of days. It'll take me another afternoon to get the NAS, data backups and such all working again once we have that.

**$BloodyStupidJohnson:** But I followed the instructions perfectly!

**$Miscreancy:** What instructions? \[shown YouTube video\] Unfortunately, as I said, the NAS wasn't the server with the broken disks, it's the one with the backups. The desktop computer is the server that needed the replacements, so the instructions were for the wrong things.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't dive too deeply into the following conversation, in which he actually got very upset and close to tears at one point. He did admit it was his error, and he was very sorry. We got him up and running on $PopularAccountingSoftware that day, and the following Tuesday the NAS was restored and normal service resumed.

Normally when he did something like this, it was only my time that got wasted - time he had to pay for - so there was no data loss or major downtime. This time he had lost days of work, and I believe it probably did teach him to stop trying to do things he wasn't really equipped to do. I wouldn't know, as this was the last bit of work I did for him. Shortly after this I left the free-roaming life of a freelancer behind me, to re-embrace a world of dull corporate stability (but markedly cheaper vehicle insurance).

There was one upside to this though, which was the exchange I had with $LadySybilRamkin upon her return from her Overseas Adventure, after having relayed the whole saga.

&amp;#x200B;

**$LadySybilRamkin:**  So, to be clear - he decided to go ahead without you, largely because he thought it was a case of wielding a screwdriver and replacing some stuff, and you could do the more ""IT-related"" bits.

**$Miscreancy:** Yep.

**$LadySybilRamkin:** And someone told him recently to smash old disks into oblivion, so he did that ahead of your arrival by screwing screws into the disks and then hitting them with a hammer.

**$Miscreancy:** Also yep.

**$LadySybilRamkin:** So what you're really saying is... he screwed himself.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, when faced with punning of that high-level quality, there's only one thing a man can do.

Reader, I married her.


TL;DR: never tell a user what you're going to do before you do it, in case they try to do it themselves. They will mess up, and you will both be sorry. But if you do, your girlfriend may make a joke so funny you simply had to marry her.


Edit: added a TL;DR after multiple requests.

Secondary edit: Platinum, gold and silver! Good lord, people of Reddit, you are extremely generous. I hope you enjoyed this post, and I will no doubt be returning to write another in the future.

Part of this setup includes labeling a laptop docking station with directions on where each cable needs to be plugged in, because we can’t be bothered helping *every single user* set up their equipment. After finishing the setup for this standard laptop/dock replacement, I hand it over to our mailing dept. who then sends it to another building.  Halfway through setting up a device for another user, I hear my instant message client ding. It’s the user I just sent the laptop/dock. The conversation went as follows:


$User: Hey it’s Namey McNameface, you just sent me a laptop and I’m having a trouble connecting my second monitor. 

$Me: Okay, can you walk me through how it’s set up?

$User:  yeah, the monitor is plugged into the back of the dock and the USB-C cable is plugged into the port right next to it.

I know that the port he is describing is actually for usb-c charging and not the actual port used for monitor traffic. 

$Me: (thinking I must have forgotten to label the dock) have you tried plugging the USB-C cable into the other USB-C port?

After a few minutes I figure out the server's address is 1.75. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: Okay, I found the problem. It seems the server is in the wrong IP-range. Your PC is in the 0-range. Your server is in the 1-range. You need to change it in order for the server to have internet connection.

&gt;C: How do I do that?

t3_c0haw4,RAM Replaced...,"Hello All,

First post here so be nice ;)

Anyways, had a user a few weeks ago now - pc is beeping and won’t boot up, fine. Go over to his desk and it’s beeping 5 times, RAM error. 

Opened up the side panel and there’s 2 sticks of DDR2, mega-bling, 4GB RAM in there which as a business we’d never issue so I asked him had any other techs changed anything he said no. 

So, I took the RAM out and installed 16GB and all was fine, PC booted and he’s back working. 

Anyways, fast forward a week or so and he’s boasting to me that his PC at home has had a RAM upgrade since “about a week ago” and it’s been mega fast since, I said “oh cool, what did you put in it” and he said “16GB” then his face dropped when he realised what he had said and he quickly said that he had to go and start working again....

He replaced the damn RAM from his work machine in his personal machine and swapped in his RAM from home to his work PC like I wouldn’t notice 2 gold RAM sticks inside...

Smh, anyone else had internal components stolen by users? And/or had users try to cover it ?

TL;DR: User stole RAM from his work PC and swapped it with his personal PC’s RAM which was incompatible then he slipped up a week later and told me he did it.

EDIT: He has been fired for gross misconduct and the company are pressing charges for theft!!!!",talesfromtechsupport

Me: ""Ok no problem. Lets take a quick look.""

Monitor has power, Input is correct, vga cable is tightened down, but as I'm fiddling with cables, I notice a mini tower sitting next to his normal sized workstation. It was previously hidden since I was on the other side.

Odd, but ok. I turn back to the machine, and I notice something taped to it. Something that looks like a rectangular button, which is attached to a box that looks like the tech equivalent of an octopus.

t3_c0j7rt,This one went the extra mile to get some game-time...,"Once upon a time, in a company far, far away...

&amp;#x200B;

This happened some time ago. Back when optical drives in computers were commonplace and mostly necessary. Back when the default windows desktop wallpaper looked something like the teletubbies land.

I worked in IT for a company producing stamped steel parts and the relevant tools. One day, I received a ticket from someone in the mechanical workshop, stating that outlook wasn't working. I tried calling but they didn't pick up the phone, so i thought ""the snack machine is on the way there so i'll just check it out in person""...

Having arrived, i wondered at first why the wallpaper was still the above mentioned teletubby-land. Also, the window decorations were enabled (think green start-button).

For the background: These two settings should've been disabled by our Default User Profile. But the user probably just enabled them back. Or so i thought.

Marching on to finding the problem, at this point i was pretty sure the outlook item was just missing from the desktop - i didn't find c:\\program files\\microsoft office\\officexyz\\outlook.exe to point that shortcut to. Or any other Office application. Or any by-default installed application like our ERP solution.

I then tried connecting to our file server, to reinstall office but couldn't connect. The computer was no longer domain-joined, so just the short name did not work. When i tried domain joining, i couldn't since it was a Windows XP Home Edition (we would have Professional installed).

So i began looking for the user and started questioning him. After some of the old ""i did nothing, Outlook was just missing when i turned on the machine"", he opened up to me, stating that he's working mostly night shifts and he wanted to play solitaire (which was not installed on our machines). So he brought a Windows CD (""burned from a friend, who downloaded it from the internet."") and popped it into the drive and re-installed Windows XP.

&amp;#x200B;

I then took the computer with me for re-imaging (with some extra wait time) and brought it back to him a couple of days later, but with a disconnected CD drive.

t3_c0mry0,Why Would a System Administrator Need Access to Data Anyways?,"My experiences at this company can be summarized in this one simple request. I am a Salesforce Administrator for a company of almost 400 people. They have no central IT department, Data management department, CIO, you get the idea. It's also 8 companies merging under 1 umbrella so chaos is an understatement.

&amp;#x200B;

I spoke with one of the heads of the acquired companies about how we might be able to leverage Salesforce to save money on their current reporting process which is done all manually. Got the green light and would save at least 5 grand a year on that. Not quite enough to make up my expense to the company but it's a start. No big deal, set up an integration plan, get that done, and we're set. HAH!

&amp;#x200B;

Method 1: Integration

&amp;#x200B;

I poke some shoulders and get directed to the head of an internal resource we have in manilla that handles IT and admin tasks for companies to see if we could do a project with them. It's not in their regular scope but they humored a discovery at least. The answer was a no but they did direct us to ANOTHER business leader who might have some resources and he set up a meeting. Method 1 failed.

&amp;#x200B;

Method 2: Integration V2

&amp;#x200B;

By now they have wasted a week of my time and I really just want a f\*\*\*\*\*\* login so I can write my SQL query and go on with my life. Well, the VP of Sales (my boss (MY ROLE IS LED BY A SALESMAN)) caught wind and said ""The market is hot, put this on the back burner we need all eyes on the field right now."" Well, thankfully I have already met my sales quota for this year \*/s\* so I will press on. However, I did lose focus of the other two leaders who were helping me at that point. No biggie, just need access to write my queries.

&amp;#x200B;

Method 3: Do it Yourself

&amp;#x200B;

If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself. No problem, everyone else has more important things to do than help me with this one simple thing so I'll just login to the database. I go to an admin coworker of mine who works in other systems and asked if I could get access. I have to open a ticket with that particular company's IT support resource. So I do, and after 3 days of phone tag I get logged in. I have no privileges. So, I go back to my admin friend who bounces me to the EA of the president of that company who bounces me to the Controller of the umbrella company who replies to my email with ""I'll look into it"" and the ticket with ""This guy should never be given access ever."" and they are now investigating why I had or need access in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

t3_c0mf44,"So you're telling me right now, that what I just did deletes everything?","Non-native english, and non-accountant so I might be wrong on a few terms.

I've been helping out at my family's business for about a year, a few months ago our only IT guy left so I've taken more responsibilities than anyone with no practical experience should have.

One of the maintenance proceidures that I have to do is once a month is due to being processed by accounting, I'm responsible for processing the invoice transfer from the ancient Inventory / Invoicing system to the much newer Accounting system. We had been plagued with inaccurate reports and tons of weird shit, vendor suggestions had us expand the scope of pre-transfer maintenance by at least 5x. Previously the process lasted about 6 hours, now a full 52 hour weekend was good for... 20% maybe? At least that allowed me to expedite the SSD upgrade I was looking for, we're now back to a weekend.

I'm finally able to finish up 2 pending months about 2 weeks ago, first time I've processed it myself (last months were done by the old guy as contractor) and first time we're processing a month after the IT guy had left. Usually many items don't get processed correctly and get flagged up for inspection, but this time we had items that didn't get processed *or* flagged. I had thought about these items after the proceidure, as they had some missing info added afterwards coupled with tons of db maintenance trying to chase down some other issues. Told them I'd try to regenerate those 2 months and see if we can override those entries, after closing time I leave the system running overnight.

Next morning I walk into the building, and as I'm sitting down I was approached by the accountant's assistant.

&gt; Hey OP, out of curiosity... did you wipe the 2 months from last week?

*ah fuck*

Yup, even though I haven't transferred or touched anything on the accounting side, I guess the system deems it appropriate to just auto-delete everything that was reprocessed. The program usually has detailed explanations on what proceidures do, apparently this was the one exception. Since the day had already started we were unable to restore from daily backup without cancelling about 3 hours + tons of invoices, we had to continue with uploading the reprocessed info.

2 days later, accountant's assistant comes back. *Zero flags, zero errors, everything worked.* I guess these events are gonna be our secret.",talesfromtechsupport

I had a user come in to have their laptop updated after being off the network for a month. No biggie, connected them to an Ethernet, re-enabled the device in DHCP,  and began updates. Gave user a loaner for the time being and told them I'd update the ticket when it was done.  Well, surprise - patching finished withing 3 days. Sent an email and about a week goes by but the user never came to pick up the laptop. Did a courtesy visit to let them know and the office door was shut. Thinking nothing of it, I left and show up the next morning at 8 am to squeeze some hours in before my class. 

First thing I noticed: the laptop is gone. 

Somewhere down the hall from the help desk, I hear crashing and screaming. Walked over to investigate and it's the laptop's owner in full rage mode. By the time I had gotten there he had taken half of his IT equipment of his desk and tossed it to the center of his room. He went as far as to take his UPS and toss on top of the pile and continued his rampage. Ngl, I'm fucking terrified at this point. None of the full-time IT Specialist we're in until 9:30am. I'm the only one there and there's a dude loosing his mind in front of me. 

So I wait out the storm in the help desk and hear him angrily grumble down the hall. He goes back and forth, walking into a couple of offices then once again storms out of the building in anger. I don't think he noticed that I was there (thank God) and the air in the office was tense for about an hour. Slowly, the office inhabitants he visited started to trickle in; sheepishly telling me different reasons for the rampage.  

One person tells me his computer went into a never ending loop and then shut down. 
Another tells me he couldn't print or see any of the mapped printers.  
A third person said that all his files were removed on his profile. In short, nothing was adding up. 

I went back to look through his pile of equipment, attempting to piece together what actually happened. Surprisingly, the laptop wasn't damaged to bad. A couple of scuffs but otherwise perfectly fine. Turned it on, logged in, checked his profile and everything was there. I was able to print and all printers were accounted for.  

Couple hours passed and the real IT Specialist show up. Mentioning the situation resulted in some rolled eyes. Apparently, not the first encounter with this user's rage. A quick phone call later and the issue was found to be him forgetting his smart card to login. Wild. A smashed monitor screen, a pile of IT equipment and a unnecessary scene. Great.

User:

&gt;Hi,  
&gt;  
&gt;I am have problem with attachment this orange circle with a wheel  
&gt;  
&gt;In it has come up on the tool bar and I can’t open an only certain  
&gt;  
&gt;PDF’s.

&amp;#x200B;

**I don't really know what this means, but it's a PDF issue.  Should be pretty easy to figure out.  I ask her if she's tried restarting (she has) and when a good time to troubleshoot is.  We schedule for today.  She tells me the area she is in has really bad cell reception and she wont be able to talk on the phone.  I explain that we shouldn't need to talk on the phone and that the remote support tool we'll be using has a chat function so we can communicate once she lets me into her PC.**

&amp;#x200B;

Me:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Good morning, would now be a good time for us to get connected and work on the Adobe issue?

&amp;#x200B;

User:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yes also I can’t get in to VMS and the share drive.

&amp;#x200B;

**VMS is a program they use.  Okay, so one issue has now turned into 3... but shouldn't be too bad.**

Me:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Please go to \[remote support URL\] and download/run the little program from that site. Send over the

&gt;I have a nine digit code that says share this code with your technician. But it will not let me share it.

**Unfortunately, I can't come to you as you're over an hour away and I'm stuck behind a desk.  I ask if there are any alternate numbers I can call to walk her through this.  She tells me no.  I suggest restarting her computer and trying again and I quickly make a guide with screenshots to walk her through how to get and send me the 9-digit code.**

&gt;  
&gt;If you close it, I will not be able to connect.

User finally gives me a code that works.  I am able to connect and start working, but she doesn't remember her username and password for her computer (that she is logged into currently) to reconnect the network drive.  Have to do a password reset to complete everything.  Total time: 3 hours.  Total bill: $450.

t3_c07or1,Imaginary security breach,"A funny one that happened to my colleague.

&amp;nbsp;

Early in the day, he got a call from a problematic user. She told him that (allegedly) someone outside our company could access files on her computer. She demanded he immediately drops everything he was doing and get on that case, because it was ""A major security breach"".

&amp;nbsp;

As he comes back, he has that grin, the one that's a mix of confusion and anger, but with a sprinkling of amusement.

&amp;nbsp;

The user had received an email from a friend with a .pages attachment. We work with Windows, so we don't have a default program to open those, but Adobe Acrobat attempted to do so. After giving an error message because of the file format, Acrobat goes back to its home page where you can see previously opened files for quicker access.

&amp;nbsp;

Apparently, the user thought that her friend had sent her all the .pdf files she'd ever opened on her PC, including confidential data. This confused the user and led her to call us in a panic. She even sent a couple emails to our boss.

&amp;nbsp;

Nothing we could tell her would convince her that no, her friend could not, in fact, access those files.",talesfromtechsupport

Ticket came in late afternoon yesterday, a user is getting an ""Application Blocked"" when trying to access our web app. Note, this user is a government employee, so this issue is ""serious"". Also, this customer has their own local IT team that does all their desktop, network etc support, we just support our applications. The ticket gets marked as low priority as it only affects one user, and we are currently working on some high priority tickets.

The next morning we come in and get to work on tickets, this one has been assigned to me so I open it up and look into it further. The user has kindly provided a screenshot of a popup.

&gt; Account Error

&gt; Account Blocked

&gt; Your security settings are blocking this application from opening.

Ok, the message clearly states that it is there secirity settings causing the issue. The ticket also notes that other users in the same office and team can access it fine. I send it back to their local IT team to check the security settings for that user.

I carry on working on tickets and get a call later in the day from the Account Manager. The customer has called up to escalate this ticket as it turns out that two users are affected. I search the ticket in our system and find that the IT team had sent it back to us with

&gt; Issue is with an Application Error. Please fix application

I inform the Account Manager of the actual issue being with security settings, and since he is onsite, he finds one of the users with the issue and asks them to try logging in. When the pop up shows up, he asks them to press ignore just to see what happens and what do you know, the application loads. Ticket closed",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c0a2cb,"Network equipment got fried, but user can resolve himself.","Lighting storm last week knocks out PCs and network equipment for a few clients.

One particular client had their PCs fried via Ethernet. Of course, router and switch die too. 

So, PCs get replaced, but user states he would rather just go to Staples (local tech store) and buy replacements for the networking gear. User is notorious for buying their own hardware and not letting us do setup (which is why their home grade equipment is open to power surges)

I get a call today, that only one computer has internet, none of the rest.

I get onsite, ipconfig the one computer with internet...it has their public IP assigned to it.

t3_c0b8la,"""Are You Laughing or Crying?"" ""Both""","New to tech support, recent college graduate. I always enjoyed some of the silly calls and stories. Things like an older employee's laptop not charging to only discover, that for the fifth time in just as many weeks when moving his power strip that the charging cord is plugged into, he plugged the power strip into itself. I was warned repeatedly that the humor would soon fade since the more you lower your expectations for your end user, the faster the user will race you to the bottom.


Today was the day I finally lost some of the humor. We have a new employee here, let's call her Sheri, and she tries so hard to solve her own problems, but she apparently tries just a little harder when she creates them.

One of my first interactions with her with something silly. She created a large number of inbox folders to help her stay productive. Then that day, she lost them! After suggesting that she collapsed them by accident and to look for the arrow to expand it, she insisted they simply vanished and there was no arrow. After completing the quarter-mile hike to her office, I asked her to show me what she was doing, and low-and-behold as she was clicking on her inbox, she expanded the inbox revealing them! With a few small laughs I left hiking back.

She's had a lot of these moments, but today took the cake. She called in about how tiny the text appeared in her outlook. I first walked her through checking the font size of everything over the phone, then I remember the zoom function in the bottom right, because ""hey she probably just held down control+mousewheel"" and shrunk it. Well moments after telling her about this she simply says, ""Well it was tiny, but now it's at 500% and huge. What do I do now?"" I had to take a moment to compose myself admittingly, then told her to just set it to 100% for the default view. She went on to say now that the mail preview is properly sized, when she goes to write it, it's terribly tiny too. I knew I had to move some equipment up near her office and just said I'd swing by shortly and show her how to do it in person to make sure she was educated on it to prevent further issues.

I really enjoy my job, but my coworkers both said they have ""their one"" that just drives them insane. I think I found mine.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c0c4na,The RSA Crisis of 2017,"I work for one of the biggest insurance companies in the world. we service about 49k+ not sure about the real number because we have contractors and vendors we help.  This was my first long term Help Desk job so I was grateful to have the job.  I normally miss the rushes and the outages because I would come in at Noon and then get out at nine at night, but there was no shortage of strange I tell you but that is for another time.  This tale starts in November of 2017.

&amp;#x200B;

This event happened on December 7, 2017.  Mind you we normally have about 70+ agents at our help desk and I was the last time come in so we were fully staffed.  When I looked at our board we had 150 calls waiting.  Normally around this time of year people are taking off and things are slowing down because the Changes to the network begin to stop so less of a chance for Sev 1 issues would happen.  Well it happened and it was a big one.  It effected over 30K people in our company, help desk included.  Every single person's RSA Tokens stopped working.  On a normal day we would have about 300 to 1000 calls.  We had over 5000 call in and half of them went unanswered.  It was like this for the next 2 months non stop calls about the same thing.  Needing my RSA Token fixed.  

&amp;#x200B;

The issue that caused this catastrophe of megalithic proportions is some Executive assistant having accesses he or she shouldn't have.  We never found out who but we knew where it came from, the land of the rising sun Japan.  They had Struck again they didn't go after our warships this time they went after our Remote access to the network.  What happened is an executive needed an RSA Token and he was from Japan, it is required to have their email address put into the token.  The requirement was only for those with Japanese profiles no where else.  The assistant updated the token and clicked apply all, and so the the bomb was dropped.  

&amp;#x200B;

There were 3 groups working on this issue and the Help Desk found the fix delete the email address from the token.  By this time they had removed the apply all option so that would have been nice to just revers it all in one fell swoop.  We send out a mass email to all parties needing to know what the fix was and start doing the fix.  We get another email stating that all tokens are going to be scrapped and new ones are going to be assigned to everyone.  We were already 10% to 20% in on fixing people's issues and then they do that.  It starts all over and now we have to give people new tokens.  We eventually ran out and had to order more from the Vendor and that slowed things down even more.  

&amp;#x200B;

During a time it was supposed to be slow it was the busiest I had ever seen our desk from December 7th all the way though January 31st it was back to back calls.  Every other call was for their RSA Token to be redistributed even after we set up a self service distribution system for it.  The funny thing about it they gave all of us a certificate stating I survived the RSA Crisis of 2017.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:  Japan Bombed our network by having some one with accesses they shouldn't have update every one's access tokens.  No one listened to help desk causing help desk to be busy during the slowest time of year. The reward we got were fancy pieces of paper.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c0bkj8,"""Facebook plugin disappeared!""","First of all, I'm not at all in a tech support field. I do website content and social media management for one of the departments at my faculty. It's a job I've just started a few weeks ago so I'm still getting the hang of things and being extra careful to not screw something up in the weird CMS their website uses.

Anyway, today I stared my morning with this email from my boss:

&gt;Subject: *URL of the department's website*
 
&gt;Content: ""Facebook plugin disappeared. Please check and sort this out.""

I am in low-key panic and high-key confusion. Facebook plugin? What plugin? Does he mean the ... the widget?

I was editing something through the CMS the day before and part of me is very afraid that I'm responsible for this disappearance, but at the same time, part of me is also very sure that there is no way I managed to delete an *entire section* of the page by accident and without noticing. I mean, the CMS is tacky, but not that tacky!

So I take out my phone and nervously open the website (in Opera) - lo and behold, the widget is right where it should be. I reply to the email with a screenshot of that, to which I get:

&gt; ""Ah apparently this is some issue connected to the add-ons in Firefox. It also displays normally in Chrome and Internet Explorer. Please still look into it if you have time.""

At this point, my panic is replaced with pity and a tinge of admiration for the poor soul who waited for Explorer to load the website just to see if the widget was there.

I decide to further look into it in the evening. I get home, open my laptop, open the website in Firefox and ... the widget is still there, to my great surprise. So I make my life easier and google ""firefox facebook widget not showing up."" The very first result points to the built-in content blocker as the source of the issue. I open settings, set mine from standard to strict, reload the website and boom! The Facebook ""plugin"" has, indeed, disappeared.

I sent another email to explain this problem. Now waiting to hear back before I add ""savior of Facebook plugins"" to my LinkedIn.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_c00num,I got an almost free expensive laser printer,"Years ago I was providing tech support as a 3rd party contractor covering multiple sites and all sorts of issues.

It turned out to be an HP Laserjet 4000 series printer that looked new so I asked what was wrong with it to be told 'oh a sheet of labels went through it and it stopped working'. I'm a bit puzzled by this and ask why not get it repaired? Manager says we've already ordered a replacement please bin it. I put it in my car and take it back to the main site and tell my boss the story and tell him I don't want to bin it but happy to keep it with permission, sure says my boss do what you want with it since it was destined to be scrapped anyway.

t3_c00byh,Tales from University Helpdesk: I turned the laptop off! I pulled out all the cables!,"So, I work at $University's technology service desk. Tier 1 support, so I get all the frustrated calls from students, staff, faculty, and alumni, asking for password resets, complaining about two-factor authentication, or asking if the phishing email is legit.

&amp;#x200B;

Had a frequent flyer walk in to the help-desk, she changed her password some days prior, and now she couldn't get on $University wifi. Of course, she's on a macbook pro. $University tries to make things as simple as possible when it comes to password management. Your AD password is the same as your GApps password, is the same as your online tools/blackboard/canvas password. Each user has only one password to deal with. Staff and Faculty are required to change their password once every six months, and faculty are required to make use of a contracted third-party Two-Factor Authentication system, which has options to call any phone number the user registers with the system, authenticate via a keyfob, or push notification on an Android or iOS device.

The problem is that for users of Apple products, if you change your password while your device has a profile for the campus wifi, iOS and sometimes MacOS will try to authenticate with the old password once every other second, which will lock users out of their account.

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately recognize the issue, confirm that the timeout for the user has elapsed, and reconfigure her device for wifi, showing her every step (our landing page/captive portal contains step-by-step instructions). She then starts asking about issues she had with her machine. This was important, she needed to be able to extend her desktop to a projector as freshman/transfer orientation began in less than an hour and she was literally running the show. I ask her how often she turns it off.

""Every night, when I was issued the laptop by $dept.IT, he said to turn it off every night when I was done using it!""

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, well let's try a restart and see what happens.

&amp;#x200B;

It takes a while to restart. A suspiciously long period of time for a Macbook pro with an SSD.

&amp;#x200B;

She then tells me ""well, you showed me how to do the multiple display thing in the settings. I need to run to my office, I'll try it there and call back if I have issues""

&amp;#x200B;

Ten minutes later, my phone rings, it's $user.

""Hi, I was just in the help-desk, and one of your guys helped me out.""

""Yes, $user, I remember you"" (I had given her my name when she walked in, and when she left)

""Well, I can't log in to the MacBook now!""

&amp;#x200B;

I have her try her new password to no avail, and check for caps-lock.

Her old password works just fine, which means her macbook hadn't been syncing as it should be, and something was hinky.

&amp;#x200B;

""Just wanted to double check, how often do you shut it down, by going to the menu in the top left, and selecting the option to shut down the MacBook?""

""Oh, I never do that. I do turn it off every night, I close the lid and remove all the cables!"" She was so happy with herself for following the instructions of her $Dept. Tech

""Yea.... that's not turning it off. You're just closing the lid and removing the charging cable. that doesn't actually do anything""

t3_bzxe88,When an end user attempts their own hardware repair,"Hey TFTS! It's not even Halloween but I have a terrifying tale tonight.

$M = Me, $U = User

&amp;#x200B;

Several months ago I was on-site at a client's office suite. They use HP laptops with docks that plug in on the right-hand side. Well these docks... aren't perfect and weren't built with longevity in mind. I replace them quite regularly hoping they eventually sign off on a tech refresh cycle.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, a user walks up to me after finishing up another ticket and asks me to take a look at their laptop. They said that their laptop isn't fully docked but can't be undocked. I get to their desk and see that the \*bleeping\* dock connector is going upwards into the laptop at like a 15 degree angle.

&amp;#x200B;

$M: Was the laptop evenly sitting flat on the dock's surface before you tried sliding the dock connector in?

$U: No, so I undocked it and made it more level, but it did the same thing.

$M: ...So then what did you do?

$: Well I was in a rush for a meeting so I tried docking and undocking really hard to try and wiggle it out.

$M: \*Screams internally\* Let me see what I can do.  

&amp;#x200B;

I manage to undock the laptop as cleanly as possible in this situation and hard power it down. I then took the bottom screws off and some of the solder joints connecting the dock port to the mother board were severely bent, one not even connected any more! I take the M.2 SSD out, plug it into a spare laptop, and fire it up. I let Windows do its migration thing while I go find the $PoC for our client. $PoC isn't happy, but kind of shrugged it off and said, ""Computers are hard, you would know."" Like what!? Anyways the replacement laptop is now fully booted and I show $U ever so gracefully how to properly dock the laptop and have them try. When $U goes to connect the dock, they try slamming the connector in fast. I told $U to slow it down and got it the second time around.

t3_bzyb81,Please babysit me through an entire installation,"DA=Dumbass Customer

Me=Me. 

So DA brings their laptop to me because it keeps getting BSOD after they dropped it. A quick check with Puppy confirms his drive is usable so I can just clone his drive overnight and install a fresh one in the morning. 

Except this man is convinced he and his laptop are special or that he doesn’t have to pay me as much if I don’t touch a screwdriver or keep it overnight because he doesn’t want a new drive/screen, he wants me to fix this one because-and I quote-“You can just fix it, why does it need a new one?!”

Is that so, well the customer is *always* right sir, let me get that for you. 

Trusty recovery drive in hand we begin the process of clean installing on his system right then and there because it was the only way to get him to shut up. 

Since I have other customers in my shop I set him up at a nice table and tell him to just click “Next” when prompted and I’ll be by once the install is done to make his system better (read: disable all of Windows 10’s BS). He seems to agree to this until about 3 minutes later. 

DA: “Viking, what’s this?”

I walk over to see if there’s a problem

Me: “That’s just asking if you want a custom or preferred install, just click “Next””

Another few minutes go by and his booming Haitian voice finds me across the shop

DA: “Viking, why has it stopped?!”

So I excuse myself and scurry over

Me: “Sir, your installation is simply initializing. It hasn’t stopped. See, it’s gone to the next screen already”

This entire charade continues for the remainder of his install as I’m trying to help other customers pick up their computers, drop them off, or select parts. I must have been called over 6 times before it ended. Not my fault you didn’t want to leave your laptop overnight where I would have done all of this for you. 

Once we finally get it installed I see if he needs anything else and he of course does. 

Long story short, this guy couldn’t even properly wait for Opera to install on his system without constantly calling me over because the on-screen instructions were not simple enough. All you had to do was click “Run” when prompted. 

A quick bit of msconfig‘ing later and this thing is booting about as fast as it is ever going to boot and I think I’m finally done with this mess. 

At this point I just want him out of my shop because I’m annoyed and have other customers to attend to. I charge him $20 for my time and he wants to complain about that because-and once again I quote-“You made me do all the work”

So I refuse to give him back his laptop. This ends exactly as you think it does with him calling the police on me for “stealing” his computer and all the while I am losing business because now there’s a scene. 

Police do police things and tell him to pay me. I decide I want nothing more to do with this and don’t trespass him.

And it all could have been avoided if he’d just left his laptop at the shop overnight.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_bzurqk,The day my boss remembered I quit,"Obligatory long time first time and it's a long one, anyway... I had spent my first 3ish years at a large company with a fairly big user base both local and remote. My last year there the company split laying off virtually anyone in our department worth a damn and leaving us with contractors who couldn't give a damn and a few of us permanent tech's who also didn't really give a shit but were there long enough to bull shit around. I had finally landed a new job and put in my two weeks. The timing worked out so I could wrap a project I was literally the only person qualified to do in the entire company (not because I'm a tech god but because I said yes to enough shit to learn Mac). Little did anyone know another contractor had decided it was also his last day and didn't bother to tell anyone. This is after several people had quit and several more were about to.  
The Players:
GayBatman (GB) - me
Contractor - justifiably pissed and about to quit
Boss lady (BL) - not the greatest boss but friendly, gave a fuck, had a spine but was overwhelmed  
Random remote end user called saying his computer has crashed all week and the deadline for his project is in 3 hours and it's our fault. Contractor explained he could overnight a replacement machine and he'd have it tomorrow.  
End User: ""That's unexceptable, just have a courier drive it""  
Contractor: ""The machine is coming from *state name* and you live in California, that won't work""  
End User: ""Well you need to come up with something better than that""  
Contractor: ""It's been a problem for a week, you didn't submit a ticket, get fucked"" he then hung up said goodbye to us and walked out the door.  
I sat there giggling while finishing up my project not caring because it was my last day and not my problem like it normally would be. About an hour later my boss contacted me praying for help.  
BL:""Hey GB, Contractor just quit and made a mess, can you reach out to this user and deescalate the situation?""  
Me: ""Hey, I'm actually working on documenting the configs for the major deployment we are wrapping up so there are some instructions for whoever takes over from here on out""  
BL: ""Uh, what do you mean taking over, this is your project""  
Me : ""Well as we discussed today is my last day and I have wrapped up the deployment and am wrapping up docs for it""  
BL: ""Today is your last day? Did I know that""  
Me: ""Well I sent you and *her boss* like 4 emails about it and we had an off boarding meeting on why I was leaving""  
BL: ""Uhhhhh, I completely forgot, look I'll drive up and see you off and have you show me a few things before you leave.""  
She never showed up, I couldn't get a hold of her, so I left never to hear about what happened after that. I did get a message from her to me and another guy who left asking if we knew where something was.",talesfromtechsupport

&amp;#x200B;

Some time ago I was on-site at a client's office. I had to restart one of their $WebApp servers due to an issue with middleware (Oracle Weblogic... grrr). I made an all-staff announcement so people knew to get out of the $WebApp. When I restart the server, the electricity in their suite goes out. Luckily, their critical networking and server infrastructure are on battery backups and electricity comes back on in less than a minute. As I'm heading out of the server room, almost every user said things such as:

&amp;#x200B;

""I thought you were just restarting the server!""

""Wow, I didn't know the server ran THAT!""

""Does IT handle electrical issues too?""

t3_bzes27,Steve's Going to Heaven,"This isn't my story, but a former roommate's. We'll call him Steve.

Steve was a super nice guy, and also a tech genius. One night in college our whole apartment is asleep when someone's phone rings at like 3am. We all hear it, but try to ignore it. Then we hear Steve moving around and getting dressed. Everyone is up (no idea why we were all woken up by this, but we were), so I holler to the guy who shares a room with Steve ""Mark, what's going on?""

Mark tells us basically this: A girl in our apartment complex had her computer crash and she hadn't saved her final paper that was due in like 6 hours, so she wanted Steve to come fix it and hopefully save her paper. At 3am.

To my knowledge this girl had never spoken to Steve before in her life. I have no idea how she knew he was a tech genius and no idea how she got his number, but Steve, the freaking amazing dude he was, gets up and marches over there without a second thought.

About 30 minutes later he comes back. We ask him (because we're all still awake for some reason) ""What happened?""

Literally he turned it off and on again. The paper had auto-saved, she was just too scared to do anything for fear of losing it. Steve doesn't complain, he doesn't grumble, he just climbs into bed and says ""I'm just glad she didn't lose any data.""

After that Mark starts shouting ""Guys! Guys! Grab onto Steve's legs! He's getting sucked straight up into heaven and we can hitch a ride!""

Seriously, Steve was one of the nicest, most selfless guys I ever met. He battled cancer for years before I met him, and it finally took his life a few years after this happened, but I'll always remember him because of stuff like this he did for others without a second thought.

EDIT: Holy cow, guys. My first gold! Thank you very much! I wasn't even sure if this story belonged here since A) it wasn't mine and B) it wasn't actually professional tech support. But thank you so much!

Steve, this one's for you, buddy!

EDIT 2: I'm overwhelmed at the response this post has gotten. I'm pretty new to Reddit and VERY new to this sub, so to receive a silver, gold, and platinum all on one post is pretty amazing. Thanks, everyone! I'm glad people are touched by Steve's story. He was an amazing person and everyone who knew him counted themselves lucky, myself included.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_bzf447,Can't you just fly out here?,"I do IT and AV tech support for my company's few dozen locations across the US. They're buildings that can host weddings, business events, etc. None of them is closer than a 2-hour flight from my office. I occasionally get calls like this from entitled new hires, but this was the most recent.

The staff is supposed to do a weekly check of all the AV in the building, and then a specific check of all the AV in any room that gets rented at least 3 hours before the clients show up. They often skip this because ""It was working a few days ago"" seems good enough for them.

LC = Lazy Coworker

LC: Our projector won't turn on and we have an event starting right now.

Me: Was the projector working when you did your AV test before the client showed up?

LC: It was working three days ago.

Me: Ok, but did you do the AV test before this specific event, three hours before they arrived like you're supposed to?

LC: No, we didn't have time.

Me: \*sigh\* Ok, let's take a look.

// About a half hour of diagnosing and troubleshooting later we determine the lamp is burned out

Me: Ok, you just need to replace the lamp. You should have a spare in your storage closet. I'm emailing you instructions on how to do it right now. All you need is a Philips Head screwdriver.

LC: Can't you come do it for us?

Me: \*baffled\* No, I'm afraid not.

LC: Why NOT?

Me: Because I'm in \[state\]. I would have to book a flight, which would take a minimum of four hours to get me there, drive a rental car, which would be another half hour from the airport, all to do something that will take you ten minutes. It would cost the company close to $1000 and I wouldn't get there in time to have it working for this event anyway.

LC: Well I'll just call our maintenance guy.

Me: He won't come in until tomorrow. Can you not just replace the lamp so you don't have to issue a refund to this customer?

LC: That's not my job!

Me: Fine, is anyone else working there tonight?

LC: Yeah, Stacy is here.

Me: GREAT! Put Stacy on the phone.

// Two minutes later, Stacy gets up and replaces the projector lamp. Everything works fine after that. I sent an email to LC's Regional Manager and told them the whole story.

t3_bzf3yb,And the award for obliviousness goes to....,"Ok so, after reading some other subreddits the story of the most oblivious person I have ever witnessed came back to me, its a story I am very fond of telling and that, for some reason, I really haven't shared here. So, time to fix that. 

The date was january 1, 2017. During that time I was working simply as "" Tech Support"". Since the company I was working with was pretty young, I was a wandering techie that did a little bit of everything. Also, its the day after new years eve and, as a mexican man in mexico, I am nursing a specially terrible tequila induced hangover. I mean, its the first of the year and nobody works that day right?  So of course when I get called by my handlers at 7 am any doctor would have declared me dead. 

I get called to go fix convenience store ATM that for some reason lost connection. Apparently this is a Big Deal and cant be postponed till I come back from the dead at the third day. So I shower, skip breakfast, and then lurch to that store like one of the undead. All in all, not in my best mood. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so when an ATM just stops reporting in, it can be several things. One, the store doesn't have internet. This is super easy to determine. Two, something got stuck and the ATM decided to panic and just stop working. And because they are rather old machines, they don't report status errors to the bank headquarters, and even if they did I dont get that information because I work for some dudes fixing those atms for the bank. Swiftly but with a very grumpy demeanor I determine the store had working internet, so I start checking the machine itself. 

At this time, our person of interest comes in. She is a middle aged woman,  slightly overweight and with that whole ""I want to speak to the manager"" look. So lets call her Káren.  Káren, being a very busy woman, decides to stand in line behind me waiting for her turn to withdraw money, that she needs right now. She wordlessly conveys to me that she needs to get her money out right now by tapping her foot loudly and sighing every eight to fifteen seconds. Now because I am funtionally defunct I dont take not of this until about five minutes into it. 

At this point in troubleshooting I am working on the admin screens of the ATM wich no normal mortal is meant to see. Also, the ""Out of service"" sign on top of the ATM is very visible, but I think since Káren can clearly see I am messing with the cute buttons, this machine MUST work  right?

&amp;#x200B;

Ten minutes after her arrival, Káren deigns it appropriate to talk to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

"" Are you gonna take long?"" 

""Sorry, the machine is out of service, I am fixing it. I dont have an ETA"". In my optimistic mind, this should settle the matter. Káren knows I am busy and just takes of right? I assume she just takes off and I go back to fixing the thing. 

At this point I determine the problem is Mechanical, maybe there is something stuck in the machine, wayward card, paper, who knows? I open it up and drive right into its ATM guts, but not too sharply because I am still feeling shit and I honestly dont want to ruin the components with my biological waste. 

Ten minutes pass, and to my surprise and utter displeasure, I notice Káren is still there. 

""Can you hurry it up? I am in a hurry"" 

And I am like ""Well Geez Káren, if you were really in a hurry you would have gone somewhere else instead breathing down my neck"". I mean, I wanted to. Instead I got my upper body out of the labyrinth of  super visible cables and boards. 

""The machine is out of service, It Will take a while"" 

She just says ok. And then continues to stand in line while I dive back into the depths. Other customers that wanted to use the ATM do show up, but because they have functional brains, they leave almost immediately when they see it open. Not Káren though. Karen is in a hurry and she WILL get her money out right now, even if it takes her all day.

Half an hour and probably 15 minutes longer than it should have (because I am the dead shell of an tech) I find the problem. Water damage to one of the components. Not the main board. One of the peripherals is totally ruined. So I call it in, cause its not like I carry the replacement parts with me. They dont trust me with that.  And THIS is the moment when Káren strikes at last. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey, I am very busy, how long is this gonna take?""  Her tone has dropped every pretense of  contained urgency and shifted straight into full on confrontational mode. 

"" Lady, this ATM is broken, I am fixing it and it could take me a couple of hours""

""Well, why didnt you say so?!"" and she takes off, having wasted more than half an hour of her precious time, and leaving me a mess of near death and frustrated confusion.

t3_bz9hvt,What do you mean I can’t listen to internet radio?,"About three years ago I was working for an MSP.  One of our biggest clients was a 50+ employee office in the county that had a 10/2 wireless internet connection for the entire office. At the time that was the absolute best they could get.

Their most common complaint not surprisingly was that their internet was slow. Fortunately for us they were running Meraki gear so we were able to quickly find where the issues were. 

It turns out that about a dozen people in the office were listening to internet radio. The worst part is that it wasn’t even something like Spotify or stations in other parts of the world.  They were legitimately using the internet to listen to a local FM station.

I was tasked with troubleshooting their ‘connection issues’ and preparing a report.  In this report I cited that it’s a huge waste of very limited resources to be streaming internet radio and recommended they ask their staff to avoid streaming content off the internet. They very begrudgingly accepted my recommendation but this upset a lot of their staff.

About a week later I get an urgent call that their connection has slowed to a crawl.  I log onto the Meraki and see that there’s a single video stream using up 90% of their total bandwidth.  The Vice President of the company was streaming a baseball game.

Now my mistake was in letting my main contact at the company know this. Less than a week later they dropped us.  I guess the VP didn’t appreciate being singled out for wasting bandwidth. (Or wasn’t supposed to be watching baseball on company time.)",talesfromtechsupport

So this is more of a positive and funny tale than annoying and negative.

&amp;#x200B;

About two years ago I had recently left the army and got my first job in IT as a civilian, the job did not pay that great so I decided to pick up some freelance work to bump my monthly income as I took a big cut with this job.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I get a message on the FB page I set up for this freelance stuff, an older woman wanted someone to set up her husbands printer. I thought wow nice and easy £25 for a quick and simple job.

&amp;#x200B;

It was simple as expected and I decided to help him set up his work email as well , as he mentioned not having that set up in Outlook - all jobs are done I leave with £25 for an hours work (30 minutes) actual work he rest was mainly talking.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the next day - I get a message from the wife asking if I could come look at the printer again as it is not working and they tried everything, the day before I went in the evening and did not take much time out of my day.

&amp;#x200B;

So I figure I'd ask is it all plugged in still and powered up etc - answer is yes to all, I advise I will be there later that evening. I get in the house go right to the cable it appears plugged in etc powers on - i test print nada ?? so I think unplug and re seat the USB in the laptop, as I removed it I noticed it was in the Ethernet port - very suprising how well a USB connector fits into an Ethernet port. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I explain the issue to them and the guy pays me £20 after I said don't worry about it - I live close by so was no skin off my teeth.

&amp;#x200B;

So good deeds done and cash in pocket.

TL:DR - freelancing job  - I setup a printer for a user at their house 30 min max actual work, get messaged the next day to say it is not working, I go there and after investigating I notice the USB is slotted into the Ethernet port.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_bz5d94,A peculiar way to get out of the Start Screen,"I'm replacing computers over the summer for a small medical practice. One of them was an HP 110 running Windows 8.1, used by one of the two receptionists. It wasn't a great computer to begin with (in fact, it looks like HP put an ultra-small form factor motherboard in a full tower case), and had a slow hard drive, so we bought her another computer.

I started setting up the new PC, and got to the point of putting in a username. Now, it is my personal policy to make a new computer as much as possible like the old one. I put the contents of all their folders in the same folders on the new PC, I have them put in their familiar password, and I make sure the username is the same. 

Since I don't have much of a budget, I don't have a domain controller or Active Directory or anything like that. These are all locally configured PCs, so I have to go take a look to find out what her username was. I ask her if she has a moment, and she does, so I sit down and find myself face-to-face with a Windows 8 computer for the first time since I upgraded my HP laptop four years ago. 

Yikes.

I click on the Start button, which brings up both the Start Screen and a bunch of bad memories. I see the username is ""Receptionists.""

t3_byz2ci,2 Factor chicken and egg dilemma,"So the company I work for recently decided to add the ability to reset your own password if you missed the expiration . The way it used to work was you'd klick reset if you didn't change it before it expired, that would create a ticked and the company support would send you the reset init password, which you could used onetime to login and change. Mind you also missing the reset was hard since when expiration was only a few days away you would get notifications while login in. And passwords expire every 180 days so anyone who is with the company for at least 7 months had to cha ge his pw at least once. 

However the new system requires a 2factor, so you could used 3rd party email, phone number, SMS, standard stuff. The only real difference for the users were that when logging in for the first time in the new system you would be asked to change your pw and add a 2factor. And with every password change you will have to type in the confirmation code as well. 

Hr also made an introduction sheet with step by step Screenshots and circles buttons, since they claimed IT issued instructions werent thorough enough. 

So day of the 2 Factor implementation comes up and it's a shit show. Normally I don't work support but that day almost all it departments were asked to aid the 1st level support. 1st mail that comes in is the HR lady who made the instructions, she already received 20 activation codes since ppl were just copying her phone number from the Screenshot instead of using their own.

That still was kinda funny but then this guy calls and has numerous questions, I pull up his profile and see he has had an account for a couple of years, meaning he's had at least 2 times as many pw changes. He starts asking what passwords are affected. (mind you we have a central account, you login on your pc once and all other things auto sign in) I try to explain that this is no different that the last password change apart from that he has to add a veryfication method in order to receive the code hell need to. Reset his password in future.

Now in this Company there are 2 types of desc phones, normal ones with buttons, and software one with a headset, which you access within your account. Now this person has the later and wants to use his software number as 2 Factor. I try to explain that this won't work since, in order to receive the code, which he needs to login when his pw expires, hell have to login first, which he can't do without getting the code prior, simple stuff. He doesn't get it. 

So I try it simpler 
Me"" well imagine you put your keys in your car then close it and lock it"" 

Him: well then I'm locked out

Me "" exactly, the only way to get the keys would be to open the car, which you can't without having the keys first"" 

Him. ""I see.. So you are telling me I need to login in order to open my company car in future"" 

Well this went on for a while, in the end he said he understood. Later that day there was a ticked ""can't receive code since I can't login to my phone without my code""

t3_bz1h3b,One of the stupidest things I've ever heard in 16+ years of working in IT,"Background: I have a request to install a piece of software for one of our department managers. I got the request last Monday and this morning he opened a second request for it, even thought we have a two-week turnaround for tasks like this. The following is the exchange I had with him over email:   


Me:  I should be able to get this done this week for you. Can you tell me the name of the software and where the installer is located?   


User:  &lt;software name&gt;  


Me:   And where is the installer for this located?    


*Side-note: I think it's pretty clear what I'm asking... do you have this software on a CD? Thumb drive? Did you download it? Do I have to download?*  


User:   Somerset, NJ  


*Apparently I wasn't clear....*

&amp;#x200B;

Me:  I mean where is the software I have to install physically located? Did you get it on a disc, or maybe download it to your PC?  
  
And that's where it stands... as he hasn't responded it looks like I'm taking a road trip tomorrow.

EDIT: Fair enough, maybe I could have phrased the question differently but I've asked users in the past this question using the word ""installer"" and have never had someone take it this direction. :)",talesfromtechsupport
t3_byzrno,"Tales of Event Management Software, or, ""Don't You Have Paper Forms??""","Hi there. I don't post much. So, until earlier this year, I worked for a software startup that provided a suite of online services to help manage stuff like street markets, music festivals, etc. While there, I had a few absurd experiences that I hope might entertain somebody.

Without giving too much away, I configured our software to spec, I bugtested, and I did tech support. Whatever needed doing. There were only three other people in the company during most of my time there, including the CEO. The work culture could be rough; we hired one guy who quit two weeks in from stress. I regularly worked extra hours/late/from home for no additional remuneration.

Most of my tech support memories from this job concern daft callers. We got a lot of daft emails too, but they were generally unremarkable. Of the daft callers, the one that takes the cake is probably the one who demanded to know ""don't you have paper forms??"" when we are, of course, a provider of digital forms and don't run any events.

Most of my daft tech support queries were from people who wanted to talk to the event organisers we worked with, and somehow reached third party tech support. Many of these people realised their mistake with humility and bowed out immediately. But not all. Let's call this first one Julie. I think she may have had Dalek ancestry from the monotone, forceful way she spoke.

&gt;Me: Hello, \[company,\] Me speaking, how can I help?  
&gt;  
&gt;*Julie: I need payment details.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: May I ask if you're applying to trade at an event?  
&gt;  
&gt;*Julie: Yes?*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I'm afraid we only provide the booking service, we can't take payment for the event organiser.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Julie: Okay?*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Well, you'll need to call the organiser directly and ask them for payment details.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Julie: Give me their number.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I'm afraid I don't have contact details to hand, but you should see theirs just below where you found ours. Or, if you tell me which event organiser you're looking to speak to-  
&gt;  
&gt;*Julie: Okay bye.*

Okay. Are people out there suffering a politeness tax or something?

Sometimes the issue wasn't that people had the wrong number, but that they actually did have a problem with us, whether they were reasonable or not. This chap, we'll call him Carl, didn't like the ""inconvenience"" of online applications.

&gt;*Carl: Can't you just use the same information as last year?*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Well, I didn't configure this application process myself, but it seems not. It's a technical limitation, but I can explain it if you would like.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Carl: But you have my forms from last year!*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: They'll still be in our system, I'm sure, but we're collecting slightly different information this year, so I couldn't fill out your application for you even if it were my responsibility.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Carl: Can't you just use the same paper forms I've sent in for years?*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: You'd have to speak to the event organisers about that.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Carl: This is useless, I hate this system, everything worked so much better when everything was on paper.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Well, Sir, there are a number of advantages to digitising the process, which is why the organisers have chosen to use our services.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Carl: No, no! It's much worse now! There's no reason to do things this way!*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Would you like to make a complaint?  
&gt;  
&gt;*Carl: Never mind.*

I don't have much sympathy for people like that guy, who won't persevere with technology. We had one other guys send an email that basically read ""you'll go out of business if you keep making people submit complicated online forms it takes a computer science degree to fill out"". Lmfao. But older folks who struggle on with technology can be just as frustrating. Let's call this guy Jeffrey.

&gt;*Jeffrey: It keeps saying I can't submit!*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Okay, what exactly is it telling you?  
&gt;  
&gt;*Jeffrey: Something about the fields.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Does it say there are *invalid* fields?  
&gt;  
&gt;*Jeffrey: Yes, it says there are invalid fields, and \[irrelevant rambling\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Okay Sir, can you please check that you have filled in *all* the required fields. Any missing fields will likely be highlighted in red.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Jeffrey: Okay, let's see, first name, yes, and all that, email-*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Can I ask you to call me back if you have further trouble, Sir?  
&gt;  
&gt;*Jeffrey: Oh, okay.*  
&gt;  
&gt;(Of course he calls back...)  
&gt;  
&gt;*Jeffrey: I've checked every single box, and I've filled them all out, and it still won't let me submit!*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Alright Sir. To help diagnose the problem, would you mind going through the form with me over the phone? I'll fill out my copy the same exact way so that I can test the problem. So, first and last name?  
&gt;  
&gt;*Jeffrey: Check.*  
&gt;  
&gt;(We go on like this for a little while)  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Risk assessment upload?  
&gt;  
&gt;*Jeffrey: ...oh. Oh, no I haven't done that.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Okay Sir, that'll be the problem.  
&gt;  
&gt;(Of course, required uploads are indicated by giant red boxes that say REQUIRED...)

Sometimes we actually did foul up. On several occasions I failed to find important bugs, although in my defence I rarely had sufficient time to hunt them. The worst case was in fact the fault of my highly strung, perfectionist, misanthropic supervisor. He'd set up a balloonist application process such that the details for every new balloon entered overwrote the details for the previous one. The other data was not so much *lost* as never recorded.

Remember angry Carl from earlier? This happened to *him*. Oof. I got a pretty cross email response when I reached out to fix the problem. Nevertheless, I did fix the problem with help from the reserved but clever chap who quit two weeks in.

Not everything had to be arduous or complicated. One of the last daft calls I took while at that job was beautiful in its simplicity. I got to listen to this guy work out his error in real time. As I recall, he was asking about a music festival. Let's call him Dave.

&gt;Me: Hello, \[company,\] Me speaking, how can I help?  
&gt;  
&gt;*Dave: Hi, \[I have a question about the event.\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Ah, well, we're technical support for the bookings service. If you have a question about the event, you should call the organiser directly.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Dave: I just called the number it said!*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Yes, that'd be the tech support number. Where did you find our number? Maybe there's a number for the event organiser just below.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Dave: Uh, yes but that's very confusing! It says... ""call this number if you have a problem with the website.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Oh, so do you have a problem with the website?  
&gt;  
&gt;*Dave: No! Oh... hang on, that makes sense...*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Uhuh. The number below should say ""call this number if you have a question about the event."" Can I help you with anything else?  
&gt;  
&gt;*Dave: I'll call the other number. Thanks, bye.*

If only everybody had such wisdom and humility. But we know they're never going to.

t3_bymzrn,"""I didn't know what to click, so I turned it off.""","[ndscable's story here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/byem1e/what_exactly_did_you_think_shutting_down_meant/eqh4j3d/) reminded me of a TFTS I had recently.

I working at a medical devices company. Our equipment collected ECG data for clinical drug trials, so each data set ended up being pretty expensive ($5,000 - $10,000 per day) due to the cost of experimental drug, manpower, and legal and medical hoops of getting an untested drug into real humans.

I got assigned to a case where a site was reporting we had misplaced roughly a month of data - something on the order of a third of a million dollars and thousands of man-hours invested, vanished without a trace. The level 1 tech had tried all the obvious things, so it fell to me to figure out where the data went.

First, we knew the data (ECGs on human subjects) existed, because the site had paper copies of the data. Unfortunately, we needed the machine data because it had much higher resolution. But the electronic copy simply didn't exist - not on their system, not on our server. We checked server logs, system logs, databases, everything. We simply never received a copy of it. It had disappeared.

After almost an hour of trying to help this 60+ year old research nurse figure out what was going on, I finally said, ""OK - just go through a whole procedure. Start at the beginning, actually do the whole thing, while I watch your computer on TeamViewer.""

Everything was going normally - in fact, the quality was nearly perfect! She printed out a paper copy, and then right before she should've clicked ""Save &amp; Submit""... the screen went black. 

Over the phone, I asked her:

&gt; Me: ""What just happened?""

&gt; Nurse: ""Oh, I turned off the computer.""

&gt; Me: ""What! Wait, why?! And how?!""

&gt; Nurse: ""Oh, if I push the X, it says, 'Do you want to save this report or discard it?'. It won't let me close the program until I click something, and I don't know what to push, so I turn the computer off.""

&gt; Me: ""Wait, how do you turn the computer off?""

&gt; Nurse: ""I press and hold the little light-up button on the top right of the keyboard.""

I'd figured it out. The reason the data was missing was because it was never saved - the nurse would cut power on the laptop rather than answer the question of ""do you want to save this very important, very time-consuming report you just generated?"" (This option existed because often times, you would try 2-3 attempts to get a really clear data set.)

Bonus: it came up that she didn't know how to type capital letters. ""Someone once told me to press the shift-key and then the letter, but it never works."" I asked her to press the shift key AND the letter at the same time, and she literally screamed in joy when a capital 'C' appeared on her screen.

The client sent me a bottle of scotch after this conversation.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_byofbm,When Directors of a department are completely computer illiterate.,"Hey! First time poster. 

I am essentially a level one tech for a county government agency. Unfortunately... there are ONLY level one techs. Irrelevant to today's story however. 

One day, I am the only person manning the phones, which happened sometimes as I am relatively new. Get a call, start taking down information for the ticket. Sounds like an older man, but I try not to make any assumptions. I hear his name, this is the head of an entire 200 employee department. Take mental note not to mess this up. Start listening to the problem. User is reporting that they are having troubles printing a document. ""No problem!"" I tell him. ""At what point is the issue happening?"" He pauses a beat ""well... I dont know what to click... I dont see a print button."" At this point I decided to remote in to his machine and watch while he goes through the process. Once I am in, I am a little thrown off because the scaling for windows is set to about 250-300%. I watch the entire process, and when the print dialogue page pulls up he says ""here! There's no print button!"" 

At this spot my head is in my hands. ""Sir, do you mind scrolling down?"" I watch in primal horror as the print dialogue (which is the size of the entire screen) lurches upwards revealing the lower half of its contents, including the print button. 

""Oh... but I tried that!""
""I'm sure you did sir, maybe you just missed it last time."" 
""Well alright... thanks again"" 
""Not a problem sir, glad I could help."" 

At this point I've told the story to my co-workers for some laughs, and I work the rest of my day in peace. 

The next morning, my work phone has 3 calls from the same director's phone at about 9pm. When I call him back, he begins the call with this welcome greeting.

""Where the hell were you?! I called you last night!"" 

""Um... yes sir I see that, but I am not on call this week, why didn't you call the help desk number?"" 

""Arent YOU the helpdesk?"" (Lol) 

""No sir, but anyway what can I help you with."" 

""The same problem... The print button is gone!""

After about 5 seconds of critical thought, followed by total disbelief, I determined that he; AGAIN; was not scrolling down. 

He started to talk with a nasty attitude, so I decided to keep that call short. WELL TO MY SUPRISE, my supervisor comes to my desk and begins inquiring about my calls with this director. Apparently, this director had called the head of the IT department and complained directly to him, saying that I was incompetent and refused to solve his issue. Both the head and my supervisor of course did not believe him, but it still pissed me off to no end.

How can the director of a department, someone who make AT LEAST twice my income be so (for lack of a better word) dim-witted and stubborn?",talesfromtechsupport
t3_bymmps,Did you know that laptops need to be charged?,"Background: I work for the water and power utility board in my town. It is the largest publicly owned utility in the state. Lots of engineers and people with masters degrees here. 

I get a call one morning from a user saying that one of their troubleshooters is having issues with their laptop, turned out to be BitLocker saying they needed to input an encryption key to continue using the PC. I've only been here for four months and I'm still not sure why these PCs do that randomly at times. The fix is easy though, just search for the asset tag of the laptop in our knowledge base, grab the key, punch it, move on.

U is User, Me is... Me.

*phone rings*

Me: Service desk, this is-

U: Save it, we have a laptop that isn't working can you please send someone out to fix it? 

Me:...what seems to be the issue?

U: Something about BitLocker keys isn't letting us login.

Me: One moment please. *Finds key* This is about a 30 digit-long key, are you ready? 

*I repeat a very long string of digits to her, she writes it all down*

Me: Great, you got all that? Call me back if you have any more issues. 

I hang up the phone, feel happy that this was an easy fix but can't help but feel a little offended that this lady was so rude at the start of the call. Whatever, I'll give her the benefit of the dou- *phone rings again, it's her*

Me: Service de-

U: IT WONT TURN ON NOW!!! JUST SEND SOMEONE OVER THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!! 

Me: It won't turn on?

U: That's what I said! 

Me: You said it's a laptop, right? 

U: *there's a delay to her answer, as if the wheels finally started turning for once in the day* ...yes

Me: Do you have a power cable to charge it with? 

U: ...yes

Me: Great. Try that. Call me again if you need me.

U: *hangs up and doesn't call back*

Tl;dr: User wants her hand held for everything, yells at me to stop everything I'm doing to fix a laptop that ultimately has no charge.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_byem1e,What exactly did you think shutting down meant?,"So I got this call a few months back, and to this day it remains one of my favorite stories. It's also one that makes me heavily question the company's priorities when it comes to staffing.

It's about two in the afternoon and a call rolls in. I answer with the always-beloved canned greeting, and on the other end of the phone is a nice sounding lady. We exchange pleasantries while I collect info for her ticket; she doesn't sound young, but also not particularly old... that said, I'd say she was at the very least young enough to *know better.*

So anyway, she's having some problem or another, truth be told I don't remember what. I do remember it was one of those bog-standard problems you solve a dozen times a day, nothing serious. But midway through some of my starting questions, she chimes in:

""Yeah, so I talked to my manager before I called in, and he says people who have this problem have been fixing it by shutting down the computer. So I did that, and now the screen is all dark, and I can't do anything. What happened?""

'I'm sorry, what?' is what I did NOT reply, though I definitely thought it. What I actually did was painfully choke down the chuckle involuntarily rising in my throat, and ask if she powered the computer back on after she shut it down.

""What do you mean turn it on? I never have to do that!""

Oh boy...

So, I direct her to the big round button on her desktop, and tell her to go ahead and push it, which she does.

""Okay, so i did that, and then all these lights came on and it started making whirring noises, so I pushed it again and it stopped.""

Oh boy...

After that, things wrapped up without much issue. She turns the computer back on, whatever problem she had was, in fact, solved by that reboot. So, wins all around. She's ecstatic, thanks me for being a genius, and hangs up.

Ultimately nothing special, and she was very nice and easy to work with. Hell, I'd rather my calls be more of those and less of the type I typically get. But to this day, I'm just baffled as to what the company was thinking giving some of these people computers and access to sensitive data. There's ""computer illiteracy,"" and then theres not knowing to turn it on.

Also, looking at her job title I'm positive she makes way more than me, and that made me existentially depressed for a few minutes.

Tl:dr: When you turn off the computer, it turns off.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_byfszc,My password doesn't work!!!,"This might not be as amusing as everyone else's but I thought I would share. I am the IT Manager at a large dealership, (One of 5 job titles I hold there). I manage 115 desktops, a server, and other equipment. Now, as the owner is cost conscious, every desktop is a rebuilt system.

Our finance department uses 5 different pieces of software, one being used to print to a dot matrix printer.

One of the finance computers, the dot matrix computer will not print from any profile unless it is the admin login. To save time, and as she is the only manager who uses it, left login into admin for her, gave her the admin password and never had any issues.

Except this week. Every morning she has come in and calls me (I mention I am the only IT guy?) Says she can't login in. I go down there, login in 5 secs and let het get back to work. 

Today I got the 6th phone for the week, grumpy as I usually am, walk down there and ask her to show me how she types in the password. 

I hate watching people peck at the keyboard, and seeing that she was holding the caps lock down instead of the shift button was causing her to type in the password incorrectly.

The answering service calls me just as I'm approaching the grocery store parking lot. I pull over and take notes from the call. We have a half hour to call the customer back, so I went in, grabbed the three things I'd gone there for, and head back home. On my way, I call the customer to get a sense of what the issue is, let them know I got the message, etc. It's one of our frequent flyers. She's known for being bad at giving descriptions that make much sense.

Me: Hi, ""Susan"". It's ""saint of thieves"" from (company). I got the message that you guys are having some sort of issue. I was told your database is black. I don't know what that means that the database is black.

Susan: Yeah. Do you know (John Doe)?  

Me: Yeah. I know of him. He used to work for us.

Susan: He works for (third party) now. So, a couple weeks ago we had (John Doe) at (third party) upgrade our servers and since then our backups haven't been running on the weekends.

Me: &lt;thinking&gt;And you're just now calling us? On a Saturday?&lt;/thinking&gt; Okay. Well, that's not good. What about this database being black? Could you explain that part?

Susan: Yeah. When we log into the database, the screen is black. We don't see anything.

*Note: They use SQLPlus to log into their DB. If you've never used it, it's a Windows command window. White text on a black background like what you'd expect from a command line interface.*

Me: Okay. Are your users able to log in?

Susan: Yeah. Everyone can log in and work. We're just concerned that the backup hasn't run and we can't see the database. We've already called John Doe but haven't heard back from him. So we called you too.

Me: &lt;thinking&gt;So, you're not down. And you've known about the backup issue for two weeks. Great.&lt;/thinking&gt; Okay. I'm on my way home now. I was just running an errand. Since this started after John did a server upgrade, I'm thinking that maybe he'll need to fix whatever was done. But I can give you a call when I get home to see what we can do.

Susan: Well, can I call you whether or not he's able to fix it.

Me: How about you call me if he's not able to fix it? And if he is, just text me? Here's my number...

So, she texted me later. Something to do with the antivirus interfering with the backup jobs and DB connection. I didn't get a lot of specifics.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_bxyrzk,"If your USB cable isn't going all the way in, common sense would say there's probably something inside the port that's preventing it from doing so.","I don't work in tech support or phone repair, but I do work in retail and my job deals with phone stuff. No, I don't work for a carrier or phone store (thank god) but I get enough shit here to allow for a few stories.

This actually just took place a few minutes ago. A kid walked up to me and asked if I could fix Huawei phones or knew a place that does so. I said I couldn't, then asked him what was wrong with the phone to give him some advice. He pulled a Huawei P20 out of his pocket and told me his USB port was loose. I knew the most common cause of a seemingly loose USB port on a phone is crud accumulating inside, so I asked him the following question:

&gt; Does it seem like your cable can't go all the way in?

He immediately answered positively so I knew that was definitely his issue. I told him to get a toothpick and when he came back with one, I spent the next 5 minutes showing him how to scrape the crud out of the port. After we were done, he plugged the cable in to check and it did what he expected it to do. He thanked me for teaching him what to do if something like this happened, tried to pay me and left after I refused because come on, this is something you shouldn't pay anyone to do for you.

I'm sure that if I didn't ask him what his issue was and help him fix it on the spot, he would have wasted money just to get crud scraped out of his USB port because a shop would likely charge him labour.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_bxyjuu,I'm going to the jail!,"So... I was just reminded of another little story from my time working at a city police department.

&amp;#x200B;

For reasons that were never properly explained, the police department supported two laptops and two printers in the intake room of the county jail. The sheriff's department was about 3 times the size of the police department and had their own IT team. Anyway...

&amp;#x200B;

On multiple occasions, I would get ""emergency"" calls from various agencies about the printers at the jail. Those agencies ranged from sheriff's deputies and PD officers to city marshals to pd officers from surrounding cities; all of whom used the same jail. The jail was operated by the sheriff's department.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I was not employed by the sheriff's department AND not a sworn peace officer, it was generally a hassle for me to get access to the printers to see about them.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason, those printers generally broke down either when it was pouring down rain and I had to stand outside and scream at a camera to request entrance, then wait for the person monitoring the camera to contact a supervisor, then convincing the supervisor that I was there to work on the printer and was actually employed by the PD... OR when the intake room was full of detainees...

&amp;#x200B;

Approximately 99% of the time, the problem was that some helpful soul would try to solve the issue with printing by unplugging the usb cable for the printer and plugging it back in, thereby creating a new instance of said printer. Possibly the most egregious example occurred when someone unplugged the printer side of the cable... and then ""plugged it into"" the network jack on the back of the printer. Ignoring cable shenanigans, I think the only other solutions were once having to power cycle each of the printers, once having to change the drums of each printer, and one harddrive crash on one of the laptops.

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly, I left the PD back in January, and they still have not hired anyone to replace me. The one and only IT person left there has been swamped since I left.

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up and had to go to the toilet. Got dressed. Got my computer started. Got logged in, got in to VPN, got in to the ticket tracking software. It is now about 2:35 AM.

I find the ticket, but it is a little vague -- client had problems approving a document, as if the password we stored was wrong, and this had to be approved urgently. We don't store passwords for this; we use a ""single sign-on"" approach that lets the client use the same username and password that they use to login to their work computer. In addition, the client only provided the task ID, not the document ID, but I can find one with the other once I login.

I also pull up our work chat software to see if the user is online. She is, but away. I message her anyway.

*(Now, if you were in this situation -- client says they can't do X, and are having password problems -- what would you be most likely to suggest? Please write your answer down, but do not show it to anyone just yet.)*

Investigation reveals that the document was approved at 2:16 AM by the client. Apparently, the problem didn't occur after the wake-me-up-at-2:14-AM ticket was submitted. I change the status to Pending Client and write up my findings, and start up the mail software when I see the client is back active.

She said she'd been having password problems, so she rebooted. *(Was this your answer? Well done!)* Then everything worked fine. She submitted the ticket before rebooting, of course.

Here was this week's:

Was doing a multi-site network upgrade when I checked my email on a break. Frantic, multi-paragraph email from user, claiming their printer was haunted (seriously), that they can never get service from IT, all these orange lights are flashing. 

Email was 3 hours old. Upon reading, they replied:

""Never mind, I fixed it.""

Too curious, when I get back to home base, I drop by user's cube. ""What was the issue, so I can put it in my notes?""

""It needed paper. Someone should really tell us these things.""

I ask which light was blinking? What is beside the light?

""Looks like.. an image of a piece of paper?""

I smile, shrug my shoulders, and walk off.

t3_bxn52r,"When the hardware hates you, personally and individually.","Edit: By CPU, I mean the tower. It better conveys to my users which piece of equipment I'm talking about over the phone, where ""tower"" wouldn't. If obsessing over someone else using different terminology than you do brings meaning to your life, by all means, use my photo as a dart board and burn me in effigy. Ending up in IT work these days is pretty compelling evidence that I've committed some pretty egregious sins in a past life, so I'm sure I deserve it.

Hapless Hank is a one man IT department for a retail store chain. He handles sixteen stores in multiple states, which keeps him busy, but not overly so. He knows the network inside and out, because he built it from scratch. And in the course of 20 years, he's seen every possible thing that can go wrong with computers, except for the new tricks that (l)users keep inventing. Or so he thought.


As is usual in retail, every store has more cash registers than they need, most of the time. The extra capacity is for those busy times of the year, like Black Friday, and the weeks following between Thanksgiving and Christmas. So when something breaks, the store manager tends to just move the broken part to a different register, and not mention it to Hapless Hank until the day before a big sale on a three day weekend. This was such a week.


One of the cash registers was blue screening a couple of times a day. (Yes, Windows based cash registers. I know. Don't get me started.) Based on two decades of experience with this POS system, it was most likely a corrupted (or just bad) driver, probably for the receipt printer. It happens, and it's an easy fix. Swap out the CPU with the spare, and reinstall Windows, making the troublesome computer the new spare. Takes maybe half an hour.


Except the new CPU won't identify the credit card pad. Not a problem, Hapless Hank has seen this sort of thing before. The first generation USB cable for the credit card pads was incompatible with certain USB chipsets that the manufacturer was known to use. Toss the old CPU back in (since it mostly worked), and take the new one back to the shop to do some testing.


And everything works perfectly. OK, that really does look like the cable issue. A brief, and largely useless, call to the help(less) desk confirms the likelihood. So Hapless Hank takes the new CPU, and a new USB cable, and a new credit card pad, just in case, back to the store. Following Troubleshooting 101, he plugs in just the pad, using the new cable, and everything looks good. Adds in the other POS devices, one at a time, and everything looks good. Pulls and replaces out the old credit card cable, and notices it's not the first generation cable, but OK, maybe mice chewed on it, whatever. Plugs everyting back in, boots it up, and Windows can't identify the receipt printer.


Well, receipt printers do go bad, and all the cables have been disturbed, and coincidences do happen. Sure they do. Hapless Hank swaps the receipt printer with another register, which is known good. Windows still won't identify it. Bad USB cable? Well, at least that's a standard cable, unlike for the credit card pad. Known good cable from the tool box goes in. Same issue. And the blue screens are getting worse.


At this point, Hapless Hank has narrowed the problem down from a corrupted driver, to a bad cable or a bad receipt printer, to a recent Windows update specific to 64 bit (which the old CPU was not), *or* a corrupted driver on the new software level install disk, *or* a bad USB port, *or* a bad USB chipset on the motherboard, *or* any of several other thing. So, the old CPU goes back in, and the new one goes back to the shop - again - for more testing.


So, to recap the same digital deaths occur on two separate CPUs running different version of the operating system, with two different receipt printers, with two different USB cables, two different credit card pads, and two different proprietary cables on the pads. All of which work perfectly anywhere else.


The CPU goes into a register in the corporate store. And everything works perfectly fine. Zero issues. Stable as a rock. Every single component that does not work correctly has tested good, with multiple examples of each.


OK, now Hapless Hank is getting a little annoyed. He allots a day to do on site testing, and took an entire spare cash register along. And started carefully testing each component, one at a time, before and after a reboot, as it was plugged in. Eventually, he determined that the problems only occurred when the barcode scanner was plugged in. The barcode scanner itself worked fine, of course, but when it was plugged in, *everything* *else* became unstable or nonfunctional. OK, the cables on barcode scanners go bad, too, as do the scanners themselves. Replaced both, plugged in to the front of the CPU, because pulling the cable through the counter is a pain when it's not certain that's the problem. Everything works fine. Swap out the cable, and discover that it's actually pretty easy, because there's an extension cable that is long enough to come out of the top of the counter, so it's not necessary to actually run it through the too-small holes in the cabinet. Fire it all up, and . . . blue screens, and the Windows can't identify the receipt printer (which worked fine without the USB extension *on the barcode scanner*). Really? A bad USB extension? No problem, Hapless Hank is prepared, and has another, known good USB extension, too. It's a pain, but fairly simple, to pull the new extension through the counter using the old one as a pull string.


And the same thing happens. Blue screen, no receipt printer, dogs and cats living together, hellfire raining down from the heavens, and a whole lot of cursing under his breath.


In the end, it turned out it wasn't a *bad* USB extension cable, it was merely the presence of an extension, any extension, on the barcode scanner. And the barcode scanner worked fine throughout; at no point did it act up at all. But as soon as the USB extension was plugged in, either the receipt printer or the credit card pad crapped out, and the blue screens started. And no, it wasn't a power issue - everything but the barcode scanner has its own power supply, and the barcode scanner worked fine. And no, it's not an overload issue on the USB circuit, because the same equipment plugged into the same ports without the extension all works fine. And no, it's not the drivers on the barcode scanner, which has no special drivers - Windows see it as a keyboard, and loads the default keyboard drivers. The best that Hapless Hank could figure, the receipt printer drivers (which are, at best, a little unstable) somehow detected the presence of the USB extension on the barcode scanner, and crashed.


It was a bad week for Hapless Hank, but at least he got to see something new, and his troubleshooting technique got a good workout.",talesfromtechsupport

So this went over a chat, hence why we 2 were working on it to try and get it solved at the same time. I am pretty much a ""senior"" person with a lot of experience, and the other person was just a trainee, just got accepted.  


So here people can download server files and set up a server. And there is a client downloadable that allows other users to connect to the server. Uses are irrelevant here.  


It starts off with $User asking for help when they try to connect getting an error message that a lot of files are missing from the client that are present on the server. Curiously enough I look at the error message and it's saying a lot of files that should NOT be on the server or client. $Me asks where they got the server and client from. Both correct. They have the correct files. $Me and $T ask how $User set up the server. $User tells us that he opened the program to upload the files to a host. Everything uploaded successfully. So $Me and $T are still trying to figure out where these ""ghost"" files came from. $User then proceeds to tell us that he used to use the same node before for a different server client. Which had those files that are reported missing when $user tried to connect using his client. You might see where this is going.  


$Me: Did you restart the server after uploading the new files? (The server is completely written to memory before starting so changing the files won't have any impact until the server is restarted.)

$User: \*sends screenshot he received from $Otheruser after trying to connect\* exact same error.

$Me: Okay this might sound stupid, but have you deleted the old server files before installing the new server?  
$User: No. I thought it would ignore those, right?  
$Me: Can you please start from clean by removing ALL files from the node and then installing the new server?

t3_bxpkfa,WHERE DID MY FILES GO?!?!!!1!1!,"Let begin the tale of the difference between the $PNAPVPN and the $corpvpn.  $PNAPAPPS live on the $PNAPRDP, and $corpapps live on citrix.  It begins with me receiving a ticket from second level support, where second level documents that $PNAPAPPS can be accessed from $corpvpn. This confuses me, until I notice two things. it was a  particular second level who did the forward, and she doesn't pay attention to their email or training, and $users signature on the ticket indicates that they're a director, likely female from the name. They forward it to desktop support, which is where I enter the fray.

&amp;#x200B;

A smail bit of background, $BIGcorp devoured $littlecorp, and had no use for their IT department save 3 men, until 1. everyone complained at $littlecorp that their issues were being ignored, and 2. the building caught fire because of dust in the network cabinet from no one having the time to maintain anything that wasn't software. It was a little fire, just required redoing the network cabinet and running a few new lines. That bit of history came from a convo between $networkman and $serverman as they regaled the havoc of $duncebillingboss who was the safety man for his floor because the smoke detectors weren't working. He fled the building without alerting his wing, AND THEY NEVER SHOWED at the designated area.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the $corp and $PNAP systems remain separate to this day. all network resources can be accessed locally from either side, but both VPNs are less tolerant of resolving names for the other side.  IP addresses work though, and $BIGcorp was thoughtful enough to put in IP shortcuts for their users for the frequently accessed stuff.  $littlecompany didn't, but then, we were rarely in the position of needing access to $BIGcorps network resources except citrix, and everyone knew the citrix rules anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

$littlecompany workstaions which I administer are immune to most of the policies of $BIGcorp.  $BIGcorp couldn't figure a way to integrate all the $PNAPAPPS into citrix, so $PNAPAPPS remained where they were safe from the inevitable data corruption that befell the first app they did try to merge. $littlecompany was back up after an hour of the failure, $BIGcorp was down for...  I don't actually know, but $serverman's maniacal laughter after the tale tells me it wasn't pretty.

&amp;#x200B;

They bought me in as a contractor to bridge the gap, and see if any of the ancient knowledge from the could be dug up, and to take over the desktop ticket load from $serverman, so that he could actually be $serverman.  He assisted me with a bit, and there were a few hangups.

&amp;#x200B;

Small bit, right?...

&amp;#x200B;

I look over the ticket, and all second level did was verify connectivity to $corpvpn, and try to ping the $PNAPRDP, which didn't resolve.  It drops ICMP anyway, so pinging it is moot.

&amp;#x200B;

I contact user over IM, and get a phone number.  It's $littlecompanys area code, so this was probably going to be easy.

I connect to her computer, and there are desktop icons covering the whole screen.  it's mostly Excel sheets with a few Word docs dropped in.  I can't find $PNAPVPN, and $remotesoftware is feeling very sluggish, but that could just be her home internet.  I open the desktop folder in explorer, and do find it when searching by name.  That's when I notice a shortcut that is only on $BIGcorps computers, right next to $PNAPVPN.  I know what's coming next. I must have audibly sighed...

me: (LIAR!) They couldn't have been.  $BIGcorp keeps your personal files on a network path.  If you disconnect from $corpvpn, your computer can't find them.

$user: I don't care about that!

me: What about being able to connect to $PNAPAPPS?

$user: I NEED THEM BOTH!!!  PUT MY FILES BACK!

me: I can get you connected to both.  (Which I would've said long ago if you'd just let me explain.  But it won't be exactly as you want it...)

$user: DO IT!!!!

Now that $PNAPVPN has room to show on the desktop, it does so, right next to $BIGcorp shortcut.  I open it.

me: go ahead and enter your username and $littlecompany password.

I watch them enter their credntials.  error: authentication failed.

me: did you enter $littlecompany password?

$user: I don't have one of those.

I pause a second.  wait for it...  wait for it...  ??? Nooooo, don't tell me...

me: try your $PNAPapp1 password.

$user: What's that?

me: one of the $PNAPappX apps?

$user: I don't know what that is, I just use $PNAPotherapp and $PNAPapp3

me: (WTF?!  That one isn't even available to your department!) Use the password for $PNAPapp3.

They log in to $PNAPVPN sucessfully.  They open $PNAPotherapp without issue. Then they open $PNAPapp1, and quickly close it.  I mute my phone, let the growl out, then calm myself.

$user: You said my files would come back.  they aren't back.

Me: I can get you connected to them-

$user: I want them on my desktop!

I double-click on the $BIGcorp shortcut now on the desktop for just these situations, and open the desktop folder within.

me: All your files are right in this folder.  take a look.

$user: I don't want them there.

me: Blame $BIGcorp IT then.  if you want to finish that report at home, you have to do it this way.  There's absolutely nothing I can do about your icon situation, as I can't override what is being done to your machine.

$user: You're useless then!

me: (You don't want to do your report then...?) So the company data being preserved isn't a priority?

$user: I WANT MY FILES ON MY DESKTOP!  I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO!!!!

me: (You did not just hand me that...!) You're ordering me to break policies?  Am I understanding that right?

&amp;#x200B;

$user huffed and disconnected right after that.  I closed the ticket, remarking that $PNAPVPN is REQUIRED for $PNAPAPPS when remote, and that $user was hostile during the entire phone call, as well as her ordering me to break IT policy.  Then I email $ITVP about the call, noting what I said in the ticket  About 30 minutes later I get an mass email from $BIGcorp CEO which says ""We must sadly inform you that $user is no longer with the company..."" quickly followed up with a renegotiation meeting for me and $ITVP, which bumped my contract up 20%.

So I had this ticket for about a week now regarding a redemption of a stand-alone PDF license key we purchased last May. We purchased this through one of a well-known manufacturer along with a new laptop for our client.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's what happened:

&amp;#x200B;

@Raxril = Me

@Del = Laptop and 3rd party PDF program vendor

@Adob = Direct PDF program provider

&amp;#x200B;

@Raxril: Hi @Del, we purchased this laptop with you guys last May 10 along with this PDF program but we can't redeem it. Error message we are getting is that it has already been redeemed.

@Del: Sure thing let me check that for you (gets details yadda yadda). Thanks for waiting. It looks like the license has already been redeemed.

@Raxril: That's impossible since no one has redeemed this yet ever since we purchased it.

@Del: I see, let me check with our team real quick (This literally took 30 minutes on the line) Ok I've just verified but you would need to contact @Adob support for this concern so that they can try to release the license or transfer it to a different one.

@Raxril: Sure thing, but get on the call with me since I'm pretty sure they would push me back to you guys since we purchased the product from you. (Experienced this ton of times so as much as I can I make the 2 vendors talk with each other on a conference call instead)

@Del: No problem (Rings up @Adob support)

@Adob: Thank you for calling Adob single user support how can I help you?

@Del: Hey there I have a user here who purchased your PDF product through us but can't redeem the product.

@Adob: Sure thing can I have the purchase ID?

@Raxril: It's \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

@Adob: Hmm it seems that this is for a teams based license and I have to transfer you to the Teams department for this.

@Raxril: Wait no don't transfer me this is a stand-alone license (@Del agrees and tells him that it is a stand-alone license but @Adob is insisting it isn't)

@Raxril: Fine whatever transfer me but I'm sure we would get transferred here back again.

@Adob: Thank you for calling Teams department how can I help you?

@Raxril: Explains the situation again and provides details.

@Adob: Unfortunately this is a stand-alone license and I would need to transfer you back to their department. (I was seriously expecting this and I got transferred back to queue)

@Adob: Thank you for contact stand-alone license support can I get your details.

@Raxril: Provides details and explains the situation.

@Adob: Unfortunately this license has already been redeemed using this email.

@Raxril: That's impossible how can we redeem the license if that email you are referring to is not even operational anymore. When was this license key redeemed?

@Adob: May 8th.

@Raxril: (Dumbfounded) But we purchased this on May 10th?

@Adob: Ummm

@Raxril: How can we redeem a license from you guys if we haven't purchased it yet? Is there some time traveling shenanigans happening right now?

@Adob: (Clearly doesn't know what to do or say, but does the smart thing call centers do to wave off customers.) ""I'll escalate it to our department and give you a call""

@Raxril: I'm not quite confident someone will call me on this, are you sure someone will call me? Why don't you call me yourself?

@Adob: (Taken aback) Umm yeah sure I'll personally call you.

@Raxril: We'll see.

&amp;#x200B;

This call took 2 hours in total and @Del was still on the line to talk with me in the end, I guess he was bored off his work and just rode the call with me which is perfectly fine so he understands the bullshit we go through while calling @Adob.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_bxm4v0,But did you plug it in?,"So today we're going to talk about IT from the perspective of a contractor instead of the other way around, which should be a nice change.

Be me, the contractor. Customer is a major player in the military industrial complex and has tasked my company with many, many duties. Our most recent project involves rewiring a small (250 offices, plus a lab and simulation range) office complex, and so as a result I was pulled 54 miles to my east to help with this endeavor.

About halfway through the day the customer's IT department calls and asks us to come over to their bigger (750 offices) office across the street to hang a TV (you pay me, I'll do almost anything) and run some wire to ""2 boxes that aren't connected to the network."" My partner and I flash sideways glances at each other, shrug, and arrive in scene after lunch.

We get our toggle bolts into the wall for the TV mount when the electrician arrives at the office to move a power outlet to behind where the TV is going to be. We decide that this would be a good time to take a look at whatever the problem was upstairs, so we mosey on up to the site of the problem on 3rd floor.

Our escort pulls back a table obscuring one of the internet ports in question and stares at it for a moment. The port had two blue, neatly labeled CAT6 plugs vertically arranged in a white faceplate. 

Partner: ""So what's wrong with that?"" 

Escort: ""There are no wires running from those plugs to the commroom.""

Me: ""But... They're clearly in the wall and labeled?""

Partner: ""Someone might've cut the wires, check it out.""

I hop up on a desk and confirm that there are, in fact, wires running down the wall, and that they're attached on both ends. So we take a stroll into the commroom and, much to our expectations, the patch panel has both wires punched down and labeled. The patch panel had not been plugged into the network, which is why the wires didn't work.

Someone in IT called an outside company to run new wire to fix a port, when they didn't even check if it was plugged in.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_bxmqck,Vanishing Two Factor Authentication Codes,"Back story: I freelance as IT support for a design agency. They use Fruit computers and use the ayCloud to sync their calendar and contacts. The ayCloud requires Two Factor Authentication with SMS / TOTP code since a few years ago and someone managed to enable it for their account. 

Characters: $me, $designer

&amp;#x200B;

The design agency boss had sent me an email about getting a new employee who needed an email &amp; Fruit computer account set up. So I stopped by and created the email on their web hosting platform and created the local user account on the desktops. They need access to the calendar and contacts, so I sign in with the agency FruitID / ayCloud. The two factor authentication prompt appears, so I walk over to an unused workstation that receives those. There's no code. I generate one in the security settings and punch it into the login form. It stalls. I retry it two more times and begin to question my sanity. The code popup disappears right as I try to press ""allow login"" to show the code. WHAT is going on.  

I notice that $designer has started to watch me run between the two workstations. When they see that I'm looking at them, they quickly look back at the screen and pretend to be busy. So I walk over there because I have a suspicion. Their workstation uses the same FruitID.   

$me: I'm sorry, did you get a little popup on your screen just a moment ago?  

$designer: Oh yes there was this message that kept showing up.  

$me: Did it have a little map on it? (the FruitID TOTP prompt shows approx. login location on a map - always inaccurate)  

$designer: Yep.  

$me: And you just dismissed that without reading what it said?  

$designer: Yeah, like four times already. Keeps coming back.

$me: That message is me trying to set up the Fruit computer for your new colleague. So if you don't mind please just leave that popup for a few seconds so that I can get the login code, thanks.  

$designer is clearly dumbfounded by what a login code is but nods and leaves the popup alone.

&amp;#x200B;

How hard can it be to read a damn security alert popup!? Especially while $me the IT guy is working on the machine directly in front of you. D:",talesfromtechsupport

t3_bxgzc3,I installed a VPN router,"**Backstory;**

Last summer I was in the hospital for over a month, after spending a few months home in recovery - I eventually ran out of my savings and had to get a job. I couldn't return to my previous job as it was retail and I was no long able to be on my feet for the expected amount of time - so I think - ""I'll get a part-time office job for now and focus on taking care of my health."" This ends up being more difficult than I expected, the only place to interview me was a local Zoo for ""part-time administrative assistant"" at $15/hr, not great but I like animals and I'm not interested in anything challenging atm due to my health, and they offer me the job right away.

Two weeks into the job the Big Boss notices me and how overqualified I am, and starts giving me new responsibilities outside of the job scope (with no raise in pay obviously) - but things take a turn for the worse when I troubleshoot the accounting software for him.

**I am now full-time Head of IT;**

Over the next three days the website and graphics guy is taken off ""IT"" and I am designated ""IT"" and my first project is to get a gateway to gateway VPN running from our location to the location they opened last year a few towns over. I'm sure this would have been fine if I had actually done anything computer related in the past - but the scope of my knowledge is just google, trial and error, and not being completely computer illiterate. This makes me the most knowledgeable and qualified employee in the company. I spend three sleepless nights reading tech blogs and watching youtube videos one what a VPN router actually is and how to set them up. I quickly realize I am in over my head. A friend of mine is a database engineer, and while he has never done networks like this before he knows the primary concepts - we spend an afternoon with the two VPN routers I got trying to connect our home networks. We fail. But now I think I know what generally *not* to do, and have a better idea of what to actually do.

So I go in that week and get started. Hook up the VPN to the network switch and my laptop and get the router set up as per whatismyipaddress websites, /ipconfig all, and the user guide. Everything seems good. I go over to the second location to do the same thing, get the tunnel up, and we are good. Or so I thought. No issues the first few days, I set up remote access for people and explain how VPNs work and what they can and can't do (currently still explaining the same concepts daily). My other motions as IT during those delicate first days include; installing office, turning things off and on, and running windows troubleshooter, as expected.

Then the terrible happens - internet is going off and on, the internet and network reliant programs stop working (point of sale), nobody can serve customers - of course on a Saturday, both the Zoo's busiest day and my day off. I was spending the weekend at a friend's cottage, but since I can't find the issue remotely I decide to drive the two hours to work to attempt to get their POS back up. The Manager, who I was originally the assistant of, is freaking out because she is losing sales and to her the whole place is up in flames.

Upon arrival I find;

1. When I try to log into the VPN router: ***there is another VPN router***
2. The previous ""IT guy"" came in an hour before me and attempted to fix the network/internet issue, but accidentally ***routed the three POS computers to the printer***

Panic ensues. I find it physically in the mess of the server closet, it's covered in dust, it was here before mine. I log in with ""admin, admin"" as you would naturally expect. *There's a tunnel to the other location*. How did I not notice this? Did anyone know? Who installed them?? How did this happen??!? I immediately unplug my own router- maybe not the best move - nothing changes everything is still down - at this point I have yet to find out what is going on with the printer so things are just bizarre to me. I realize I must have installed my VPN routers on top of the existing ones, which explains the myriad of problems that slowly bubbled up.

I soon call it quits and phone the nearest big box tech store and asked for a tech guy to come save me, this ended up being less costly then I expected thankfully. We discovered the *printer-router wild card scenario* and after a few hours we got all the original settings back and verified the original VPN routes and tunnels are, and always have been, functional.

I ask Big Boss how this happened - he goes *""well why didn't you notice earlier?""*

I call the original original guy who set up the server and the network, and he had installed them along with everything else and the company never used it and eventually forgot it existed.

My next project was to set up a cloud back up - because despite being a 20+ year old business they ***never backed up anything ever***.

Moral of the story: I'm still ""Head of IT"" among 5 other  ""Head of"" titles and I now sympathize enormously with anyone who works in IT or tech support",talesfromtechsupport

t3_bxc3w4,Old modem moaner,"Long time no post from me, in part because I finally got out of data escalations and I could get sued if I posted about my current position.  However, someone in the powers that be remembered recently that everyone on my team were at some point in our careers part of escalation teams.  They also realized that we were doing our current jobs well enough to have down time... and that is why I can post again. 

&gt;Cst: My modem is too old, it’s not working I need a new one, not this old one.


I am looking at her account.  We are actively changing our current rental lineup, so as part of a promotion we are offering for free our old inventory of wifi modems.  There are 4 possible units in this promotion N1 (oldest, 600n ) B (largest and annoying firmware, 900n), N2 (firmware and latency issues, 1900ac) and A (a bit bulky, but stable, newest, compatibility with more speed tiers, and 1900ac).  Customer was given A.


&gt;Me:  I apologize there is trouble with your new service.  The modem you have is a decent modem and isn’t old.

&gt;What is your newest modem?  I need your newest modem.  This one is old because it is too big to be new.  It’s not working because it is too old.  The second light keeps blinking, it’s broken.

&gt;Me: Ma’am usually the light that is flashing indicates that there is not communication on the wire. It doesn’t mean the modem is bad.

&gt;Cst:  This modem has to be old, it’s not sleek.  My daughter got a new modem with you. It is sleek and new and not this big old modem.


*I take off my glasses to do a proper facepalm*. Sleek would be N1 or N2 because they are smaller, thinner, and are glossy.  N2 was introduced to our lineup two years before A.


&gt;Me: The modem you have isn’t old.  It is larger because of the distribution of the antennas inside of it to make sure it has a good range compared to the sleek one

&gt;Cst: That doesn’t matter I live in a small apartment.  Can you reserve one of the newer modems that my daughter had for me, because this old one doesn’t work.

&gt;Me:  I am not able to reserve the modem you want.  I might be able to ship a modem, but it will be whatever they ship out.  Now that light.  What I would recommended is that we try connecting it to a different location.

&gt;Cst:  What about the technician?  He’s coming out, can’t he bring me the newer modem?  I want the sleek modem not this old bulky one.


I check the notes for her account because honestly at that point I had my head against the pillar next to my desk.


&gt;Me:  No our technician is probably not going to have the modem. They are coming out to complete the install and make sure the modem you have has signal.  They won’t replace the modem unless they have to and I can’t control what modem they have on the truck.

&gt;Cst: But this modem too old and doesn’t work.


I gave up thinking for the rest of the day.

t3_bx3z9c,They Want New Proximity Keys but Refuse to Tell Me Which One,"This is a mini story and mini rant. Perhaps updates to come in the future.


I’m currently in training to replace the sole phone technician on my university campus. One of my responsibilities is replacing proximity keys. Most of these keys are used by the hotel we run on campus. Apparently, it’s the manager’s habit to request new room keys without specifying which one (for example, she’ll say Room 203 but not specify which of the keys for that room needs replacing).


She requested one today, and I sent her a polite email:


“Hi $hotelmanager, I’ll be happy to replace the proximity key for you. First, however, could you let me know which key I need to replace? You can find this information by giving me the first six digits on the back of the key that you still have. Once I have this information, I can replace your key right away.”


The guy training me didn’t like this approach, and walked over to figure out which key was missing. He later returned saying one key is missing and the other is already checked out, so we have no way of knowing which key to replace, and instructed me to pick a key at random.


I did so, and later walked over and dropped off the key saying, “Well, I had to pick a key at random so hopefully this is the right one.”


To which an employee responded, “Oh well, the customer has the other key, so obviously it’s the one he doesn’t have.”


I said “Yeah, so if I replaced his key instead of the missing key, then he’s going to be locked out. There’s a 50% chance that’s going to happen.”


“Oh...”


Fingers crossed I got the right one and someone isn’t going to realize they’re locked out at midnight. Meanwhile, I returned and the guy training me said the email I sent was wrong, saying “You’re not going to be able to always get your way, and your insistence to do so is bullying. And you can’t refuse to do your job, you can be fired for that.”

Update: I checked the logs and it looks like neither of the keys for that room have been used today or yesterday, which leaves open the distinct possibility they’ve mixed the keys up anyways.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_bx3hmp,When a printer is not always a printer.,"So today my colleague is having issues with his label printer.  Take in mind he just started at this new position a month ago, and is finding his way around, and learning fast, as he has been doing a similar job in the company, but got a nice step up. Big learning curve for both of us, but he is very approachable about things.

His label printer is acting up, usual thing for Zebra to do every so often, it gets confused. Go there (we are next to each other) and do the usual maintenance on it, clean the print head so the gunk is not making the thing print faint, clean the rollers, then do a reset on the printer and ....nothing.

OK, then install what I keep on my desktop for these, the tools, which is slightly better than the UI in the printer dialog. Try again, odd results.  Power cycle printer, then realise after 3 minutes, that there are TWO printers in the control panel display( hey, it scrolls lines from the Canon schizoid install, that puts in by default 18 different drivers, for 18 different flavours the printer and scanner talk, while there is still one MFP there), while there is actually only one installed, lovely how people just plug out the thing and put it in another USB port, so the OS installs yet another copy of the driver for THIS port. 

Delete the unused printer ( power off and see which one vanished), but first looked at the print queue to see around 200 jobs sitting patiently there, around a year old, waiting for the non exiting printer to be plugged back in to whichever USB port it first was installed on.

Tip from that is, whenever you are moving a PC, make a quick diagram of the back of the computer as to exactly which USB port every USB peripheral is plugged into, and put them back to the same exact position again. Does not matter with keyboards and mice ( but bet that will bite you some day if you do mix them) but with printers and other USB peripherals it makes a big difference, especially with drivers that are linked to either a device ID or a port location.",talesfromtechsupport

A little later, after I transfered a whole project folder from our server to her - not workgroup integrated  - notebook by thumpstick, she asked me why the program she usually uses acts so strangely. I look at the drawing she has opened and she shows me some real strange behavior. (misplaced fill outs, lines and entire parts disappear because of zooming in or out) 


We use more or less three kinds of CAD Software. A basic program and two additions which also can run in standalone. One of the additions is just a cut down version of the other. 

The week before my vacation, I installed the cut down addition as standalone for her to work with, hoping that our ""real"" it guy will get her new pc in the near future (should have known better...)

Back to the problem. I decided to install the whole package. The basic program (using my login credentials, because we don't have spare licenses) and the bigger addition.

We had a nice chat... Two hours long, while transferring install packages from our server to her notebook by thumpstick and running some updates (at least, we were able to get a internet connection).

A few weeks ago I was asked to install a new software, but wasn't able to, because I did not have access to our server, where it would have to be installed.

t3_bwvh8w,No one knows how to use the shop-vac.,"Another post reminded me of this little gem, figured I'd share in its own post. Now, I have to preface some things for folks who aren't familiar with industrial hardware. This stuff will be important.

* Many industrial machines have control cabinets; exactly what it sounds like, large metal boxes of varying size that hold all the electrical and control hardware for the machine. Breakers, relays, wiring terminals, and often computers.
* Many cabinets don't have handles; instead they have a little recessed slot that you'd turn with a quarter or something to actually open it. They still open easily, but it's to keep them closed from random passerby with the timmy-grippy.
* Most machines have some form of Big Red OShit Button emergency stop. These are wired to safety relays in the cabinet, which bypass the whole system and bring everything to a screeching halt if pressed. These things are red, to differentiate them from the other hardware.  


Some time ago, I...uh...worked on (and by that I mean looked at and left) a control cabinet for a very large machine that cut wood boards. The service contract for said machine, including the wee little Dell inside the cabinet, clearly specified the responsibilities of the operating company to clean and maintain it.  


One summer day, we get a (desperate) call that the machine no longer works, and that one of the operators smelled smoke. Myself and another tech get on site, roll up to this sweet piece of hardware, and try to take a look inside the cabinet. Our first clue that something was amiss was we couldn't open it. Normally you can turn the little slot key with a quarter, or your car key, but this thing wouldn't budge. I eventually had to go find a site mechanic with one of the prybar-sized flatheads just to be able to turn the damn thing.  


I get the door open, and I'm greeted by sawdust. Not a layer of dust, mind you, but visually a control cabinet filled with nothing but sawdust. It looked like the company had been attempting to create IKEA-style pressed sawdust furniture using the box as a mold. A small patch of the sawdust was black, and still smoldering. At this point, neither myself nor my partner could stop laughing. We took a couple pictures, then started digging through the smoldering stuff to get that cleared out. The black patch was bigger on the inside, and surrounded two red (ish), burnt, vaguely relay-shaped husks of plastic.   


Our laughter continued as I put a padlock on the power switch for the machine, told the supervisor I'll inform our engineers, and left.  


TL:DR: company never cleans a machine that produces copious amounts of sawdust. Dust accumulates, catches fire inside a cabinet. Only reason machine didn't burn to the ground is that there was so much sawdust, there wasn't room for air.",talesfromtechsupport

We have been having problems with specific components so I immediately start troubleshooting those components but nothing seems to be wrong with, so I start expanding my troubleshooting, all in all the process took three hours (The podium monitor is non-critical to teaching so I resumed after $Prof finished his class).

&amp;#x200B;

This happened in my 3rd month of my first year as an apprentice.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a ticket that said that a guy wants to order a computer to use for printing. Obivously this is not to much information for us to actually buy a computer for him, so i called him and i got the information i need. We agreed on a standard laptop because he needed 2 usb ports and wasn't going to use it for some special programs. I ordered the computer and set ut up once it came.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was done setting it up i called him again to tell him that the computer i ready and i can come to his location and show him how it works and if he wants some more programs than what's already installed. He said i can come any time, so i went to his location 5 minutes after talking to him on the phone.

&amp;#x200B;

I got to his location and showed him what programs i had installed on the computer. He was happy with what i already had installed, so i left the location. When i got back to the office he called me and yelled at me and said he wanted a desktop and not a laptop and i should have one ready for him in 10 minutes or he's going to complain about me to my boss. I said that we had agreed on a laptop and i had the ticket to prove it, so you could complain all you want, put you wouldn't get anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

He actually filed a complain on me, but my boss saw the ticket and just ignored it. That's the story from my apprenticeship that i remember best. I'm now on my second year and the guy is very nice to me now, so thats great.

Edit:

For those that was interested in the English version of the norwegian IT-examination, here it is. The exam vary from year to year and from to place to place so it's hard to find a exact exam that you have online(Sorry for the bad english):

You're a hired consultant for \*company name\* and deliver accountingservices to extern clients. The portfolio has increased lately and there has been little to none upgrades in IT (new computers, servers, screens etc...) and meeting room equipment. Since there more work to do, there has been incresed people calling in sick. This is something the managers want to change. The managers want to look at possible HSE-

measures.

New client hardware:

\*company name\* will exchange all computers in the company and want your help to find two possible laptops and two possible desktops. They also want information about support and serviceagreements that is avalible for the computers you choose. The computers need to be powerfull enough to run Microsoft Office and other accountingprograms. The managers want you to come with an recomendation for for what kind of computers you would choose and why(You can only choose 1 laptop and 1 desktop from the two you first recomended and tell why). Today the old computers run Windows 7 and the managers want to look at whats new with Windows 10(they basically want a demo of Windows 10). The task is to set up a Windows 10 computer and show them whats new and better with Windows 10.

Meeting room:

\*company name\* Hasn't got a funtional meeting room. The managers want you to make a meeting room plan with the things you think should be in a meeting room. They want to decrease the travelcost by having some of the meetings in the new meeting room.

Securing clienthardware:

\*company name\* has been a victim of cyberattacks resently and want to protect themself from them in the future. The last years there has been no measures according to this. Viruses has encrypted company files and the managers want this to stop and not happen again in the future.

Safety:

\*company name\* is expanding their business with 40% and want a IT-safety course. The managers want you to make a course that will make the users more conscious of the cybertreaths of today. The course must be minimum 15 minutes long.

HSE:

\*company name\* has experienced people calling in sick has gone up in the lst few months. The managers in \*company name\* want to do something about the rising problem. They want HSE-training for their employees. Make a brochure that shall contain the most important points according to HSE in a workplace enviorment and tips for a better day at work.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_bwov1x,Hard drives can not corrupt if they are not connected to Internet,"I work at a multiple location business and we have a computer that is down at a manufacturing plant. The computer runs a large machine. Without it, the machine will not work. A couple of years ago when they installed it, I offered to clone the hard drive in the machine as a backup. The manager at the time refused stating that it was under service contract. 

Two years later the machine's service contract was not renewed (to save money) and its hard drive corrupted. The service tech would not be here for a week (costing a ton). The director asked me to step in and see what I can do. (Love never being responsible for a machine until it breaks.) I traveled to the site the next day. When I opened the machine about a quarter inch of dust covered everything. (Vacuumed and blew out the entire case including front fan that could not even move because of the dust and gunk.) Only one hard drive in machine as I feared. Obvious disk corruption. Can't boot at all sometimes, not even seeing hard drive. When it does see hard drive still will not boot, not even to safe mode. 

I talk to the new manager and supervisor. Explain what happened with the hard drive corruption and what I offered years ago that could have helped the situation. The supervisor makes a disbelieving ""ahhh"" noise. 

Me: What's wrong?

Super: I just don't think it is the hard drive.

Me: Really? Why is that?

Super: Because it is not even connected to the Internet how can it be corrupted.

Me: :::blink blink::: Because it is a machine with moving parts. Corruption means that the files that are instructions for the computer are not complete or missing. This can happen for a number of reasons, one of which is just simple wear and tear on the computer parts. You saying that is like saying that you will never have to change the tires on your car because no one sits in the back seat.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_bwgy0l,Can I has ticket?,"Ticketing. The bane of my existence.

We have a self service application and a help desk that team members are to use for ticketing but try telling that to our users. They'd much rather engage local support (me) directly and call my mobile directly, send an email or worse, come and hover over my desk expecting me to drop everything I'm doing immediately to assist them.

The worst are management who feel they are above the system and are entitled to instant support and are free to bypass the system. Staff see this and the old saying, monkey see, monkey do is definitely true in this case.

I had an email recently for a support call from one of the higher ups that arrived via email. I very diplomatically explained that I would raise a ticket this time, however my role is to action tickets. We have an entire department who's job it is to log tickets and assign them to the correct teams for actioning and that if I, being the only employee covering a state the size of Texas by myself, were to log tickets, that's all I would have time to do, all day every day.

He's kind of new, so I was expecting some recognition of what I had just told him. Instead he told me that he had logged a ticket along when he sent the original email. Great I thought. Finally someone who gets it. Upon asking for the ticket number, he sent it through...

The ticket number was the same one I opened for him.

t3_bwbir7,The Password Doesn't Work!," 

Ok, a little backstory. I work as a UI designer and programmer for a company that does automation systems. Basically I give the client a webpage that lets them control things in the building like lighting, door controls and HVAC. Because we are a small company I am also our only Tech support for customers. Most of my tech support calls consist of helping people connect to their web-page or fixing one of our controllers that goes haywire.

&amp;#x200B;

Our biggest client is a local government entity that oversees sites all over the county. We have hardware in almost all of those sites and they have maintenance people that we work with often to help get issues resolved, but they can fix most small issues themselves. On each site we have I/O controllers that we use to interface with whatever equipment we happen to be controlling. These controllers have a web page that you can pull up to see all the functions of the controller modify settings and drive outputs. As per the client's request once we are done with a job we change the default password for this webpage on all the controllers. The password is different for every site and is set by the client. I just finished changing all the passwords on Friday for a new site we just installed everything on. Our story begins today, the following Monday.

&amp;#x200B;

I get a text from one of the client's Maintenance techs.

&gt;Tech: Hey what's the password for ~~redacted~~ site? I can't get in with the default password.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Oh yeah we switched over to the site password, the password is ~~redacted~~

A few minutes later he replies that the password I gave him is not working so I start investigating. I pull up one of the controllers(there are over 50 onsite), and put in the new password. It works perfectly. So I text him back.

&gt;Me: What controller are you trying to get into? I just tried the password in one and it worked fine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tech: I'm trying to access controller ~~redacted.~~ I've tried the password you gave me on this controller and other controllers but it doesn't work on any of them.

I pull up the controller in question type in the new password I just gave him and boom, lets me in no problem. I start testing other controllers and all of them work without any issue. It must be an issue with the way he's typing it. It is a kinda tricky password capital letters surrounding a number, maybe he's holding down shift through the letters and typing the symbol instead of the number. So I type the password out and sent it to him in an email.

&gt;Me: I just sent you the password in an email try copy pasting that into the controller.

Soon after he calls me and the following conversation ensues. 

&gt;Tech: When I copy it into the controller it works but when I type it out it doesn't work whats going on?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Well, it works for me when I type it out so it must be something with the way your typing it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tech: I'm telling you Zdoggy, I'm typing it right ~~R, E, D, A, C, T, E, D,~~ but it doesn't...

As he's talking I can here him typing it in one key at a time spelling out all the characters as he does

&gt;Tech: \*Hit's enter key\* \*a pause\*, Well it worked that time, okay thanks.  
&gt;  
&gt;\*Hangs up\*

t3_bw9idc,usb network adapter,"Years ago, when i was on my first job i was doing tech support for a cable company.

It was the incredible time that there was still a common use for usb network cards, and said cable company had techs installing them when installing new customers that did not have a network card.

&amp;#x200B;

so one day a lady calls us up stating that her internet didnt work.

tests on our end were perfectly fine, so it was something else, and i asked her if she had changed anything on her computer.

she goes ""no, i just got a new mouse but thats it"".

now mind you, you might see where this is going to go... but at that moment i was still trying to figure out why she couldnt connect.

&amp;#x200B;

welll.... her laptop only had 1 usb port apparently. which was in use for the usb network adapter.

but she had gotten a new mouse... you know, usb!

turns out she had actually plugged the mouse into the usb port, took the usb/ps2 converter from that package,

and connected the usb network adapter through that converter to the ps2 port.

i swear, i had to put her on hold because i honestly couldnt contain my laughter once i figured this out.

t3_bw3hui,Turn the mouse around,"Years ago, early 2000s or so, I got a gig doing some tutoring to a guy on how to use his computer. He had some business idea and went to a store to buy a computer. They ended up selling him a Mac. Top of the line model for the time. I don't remember what it was. It had the clear lucite mouse model that was essentially one big button on the top. There was no defined button.

So I went over to his house, we sat down, and he started in:

Him: The first thing I want to know is how to use this... mouse, you call it, right?  
Me: Yeah. What seems to be the problem?  
Him: Well, I can't get it to move where I want it all the time. And when I try to click something, it's really hard to hit the right thing.  
Me: Ah, well, you have it turned the wrong way around. The cord should be coming out the top. 

The only way that he was able to click on anything was when he mashed his hand down so that the butt of his palm happened to press down on the button end.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_bw3m4n,Empty Toner Cartridges,"At our company we used to have a Toner Cartridge/Toner Bottle recycling program where a third party company would send us large boxes 50 at a time with pre-paid return labels to their warehouse. It was an easy concept. Any time your printer/copier changed toners, throw the empty in the box and when it was full, tape it up and leave it for the mail room to send out, then open another box. Well, after several years the 3rd party went out of business and stopped the program. In place of this, the company we contract with for all of our copiers/printers would allow us to return empties to them, we just had to box the empties in the box the new toner came in, and print a shipping label on our own. Easy enough. Well not for this one admin assistant, who came to our IT desk as if this was the first time we had been doing it this way (had been going on for a year now). We'll call her Admin and Me for me...this is how the conversation went as she asked me to explain the process: (Mind you, the instructions were sent out to all employees in our weekly email bulletin, as well we had posted the instructions with EVERY printer and copier during the transition)

&amp;#x200B;

Admin: Hello. I have a problem. I have a lot of empty toner bottles laying around and I dont know how to get rid of them.

Me: OK, No problem. You can just use the box the new toner bottle came in to return the old toner bottle to the company. I will send you their shipping address.

Admin: What do you mean? I don't get it.

Me: You can return the toner bottle by using the box that the new toner bottle came in, just put the empty toner bottle in, tape it up, and attach the label to it.

Admin: I still don't get it. What do I do with the new toner bottle?

Me: \*audible sigh\* Once you install the new toner bottle, the box it came in will be empty...

Admin: Right...

Me: Then you take the empty toner bottle and put it in the empty box...

Admin: Yes...

Me: Then you tape it up...

Admin: OK...

Me: Then you attach the shipping label to it....and leave it for the mail room.

Admin: OK, but where do I get the address to ship it to?

Me: I just emailed you the address, it is in your email box.

Admin: OK, but what do I do with the toner after I put the address on it?

Me: \*Louder Audible SIGH\*

Me: OK...lets go through this one step at a time.

Admin: OK

Me: Do you want to wright this down?

Admin: No, I think I'll get it this time.

Me; I suggest you Write it down. \*Hands her pen and paper\*

Admin: OK, Ready.

Me: Open the box that the new toner bottle comes on.

Admin: OK

Me: Next, take new toner bottle to copier, place on counter.

Admin: yes

Me: Remove old toner bottle from copier, place on counter.

Admin: OK

Me: Take new toner bottle, and install it into the copier, where the old one came out of.

Admin: With you so far...\*writing down word for word as I give her step by step instructions\*

Me: Now, take the old toner bottle, off the counter...

Admin: take...off...counter

Me: ...and place in the now empty box...

Admin: Put toner...in box...

Me: Tape up the box

Admin: Tape..the..box

Me: Then print the shipping label, and leave for mail room.

Admin: Print label...leave for mail room...is that it?

Me: That is it...its that simple.

Admin: Just one more thing...

ME: \*Rolls eyes\* Ok...what else?

Admin: Can you write the address down for me?

Me: OK...\*takes paper from her and writes down shipping address\*

Admin: And while you do, how do I make a shipping label?

Me: \*Rolls eyes at her, handing paper back to her\* You go through our UPS or Fedex System, which is right here on the company home page. \*points to my screen showing her the link to shipping services\*

Admin: OK, i will try it.

&amp;#x200B;

She leaves, and I am relieved, as well as my co worker. We were both stunned at how she just couldn't comprehend the process without a step by step walk through. She didn't come back that day, so we thought all was well. It wasn't until the end of the week she came back.

Admin: Hey. I tried your instructions, but the toner bottles don't fit into the box. I can only fit one of them in.

Me: Yes, that is correct. You can only put one toner bottle into the box.

Admin: Well I have about 20 of them. How do I fit 20 of them into one box?

Me: \*facepalm\* If you have 20 empty toners, you will need either 20 small boxes, or a few larger boxes to put them all in.

Admin: Wait...i can put multiple toner bottles in one box? But your instructions say put them in the same box the new toner came in!

Me: \*oh dear god\* Yes, if you happen to have multiple empties laying around you can use bigger boxes and put them in, then do a bulk shipment.

Admin: Well can you walk me through that process?

Me: \*long audible groan\* Its the same process...you just put multiple toners in one box.

Admin: But shouldn't there be 20 new toners I need to install first?

Me: No, that is not always necessary.

I could see the look of confusion in her face as she tries to process the information i just gave her. Just as i tell her that, another admin who used to work on her team comes down to the IT desk. They greet each other and the admin in quesion tells her that she is having problems with shipping empty toners back. Admin #2 tells her it is not that hard, and she will assist. Both I and my coworker were relieved that she now had the help of a competent admin assistant. A while later Admin #2 comes back, asking for a few empty boxes. We ask if this is to help Admin with her toner issues. She says yes, and explains how helpless this woman is, and expresses how glad she is not to be on her team any more. She explains how every step of the way seems to be shocking to her, as if this is the first time she had done this type of thing--and the first time she had ever printed a shipping label.  I also heard from the mail room guy who picks up from her floor, that she also needed a step by step guide on how to make a label.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess some people just can't handle change...or learn something new...after 45 years with the company. This Isn't the only story I have from this admin, but one of the more memorable ones. From what I hear, Admin #2 is still helping her box and ship toners every month.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_bw6d9d,I'll just move this over here....,"I've been around a bit. My second full time job ever was doing Desktop Support for one of the banks absorbed to make to Case Bank what it is now. As a matter of fact, up in the rarified clouds was a guy who was CIO but got the main slot in the CEO seat, and as such, was well liked by the department. The bank was in the Midwest, unfortunately, which I hated while I was there and still hate now. (It's just not for me; among many other things couldn't find a bagel worth a tinker's damn.)

I'm a few months in, I know the building now, know who's who, who can get things done vs. those who are there just to talk about how Wisconsin is doing in sports, etc. One of the SVP's ~~secretaries~~ (name had just been changed to) admin assistants was having monitor problems. I grabbed the ticket and went to have a look.

The AA was an older woman, not super tech savvy. There were a lot of those in the building.

Me: ""Good afternoon.""
AA: ""Hello. Are you from the computer department?""
Me: ""Yup, I'm with Desktop Support. Can you show me your problem?""
AA: ""Yes, come around and look.""

Her CRT monitor's screen was shaking a bit. Nothing major, but enough to be annoying. I started to get down to check both ends of the cord, but felt a breeze as I moved. Small fan, quiet as hell, on the right side of the monitor. Pretty much flush against it.

Me: ""Have you always had the fan here?""
AA: ""No, I only brought it from home just last week.""
Me: ""Have you used it all week? And has the screen been doing that since you brought it in?""
AA: ""....I'm not sure.""

I pick up the fan and turn it off.

AA: ""Oh no! I need that! There's no breeze up here...""
Me: ""Take a look at your screen, please.""

It was no longer jumping.

AA: ""Wow, it stopped!""
Me: ""Because the fan's off.""
AA: ""I don't understand?""
Me: ""Ma'am, there's a magnetic field that comes from all fans. In this case, it was playing a bit with the monitor.""

I got under the desk, unplugged the fan, and plugged it in further down on the other side of the desk, away from her mouse and keyboard (and most importantly, CRT) but close enough to still get  a breeze. Turned it back on. It was far enough away not to do anything.

AA: ""But it's so far away now..."" 
(It has been moved about three feet.)
Me: ""You could move it back, but the screen will start jumping again.""
I illustrated by pulling the cord out and stretching a bit to put the fan on the left side of the monitor. Predictably the screen started jumping again.
AA: ""Are you an electrician too? How did you know about this?""
Me: ""I used to drive my parents nuts by putting magnets on the TV when I was a child to distort the image. They got mad, so I learned a bit there.""

AA said she'd probably move the fan, but keep it away from the monitor.

I chalked that one up to the win column. Fortunately I hadn't introduced myself so she couldn't ask for me by name later, and up until I left I heard about her asking questions after me if I ever went back to electrician school...",talesfromtechsupport
t3_bvtng2,"Disaster Recovery or: Redundancy is great until that fails, too","I hate disaster recovery (DR) testing. It's such a pain in my ass. Wrangling all the vendors and educating the users, coming up with the plans and formalizing all the documentation for the C-levels. But I know first hand why it's so important. All the little annoyances and frustrations- they're all worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

I hadn't been in my position for very long- only about 6 months or so. My $boss and $coworker-not-appearing-in-this-story were also new. We'd all been hired at the same time and tasked with managing our central database and its related hardware. The system, while not in bad shape, wasn't exactly in the best of shape either. Crucially, (and as we would come to later regret) it needed firmware updates and a few other housekeeping things done.

&amp;#x200B;

I was waiting to finish my last task of the night: import a file into the database when it came in, then notify my coworker in another department. She would then do....something...with that data and then we could both go home. The system had a little console utility that let us view the console messages real-time from the comfort of our desks. I normally kept it up all day just to keep an eye on things.

&amp;#x200B;

That night the file was later than usual. So I sat at my desk, busying myself with something or other while the console utility scrolled serenely on my second monitor. I'd gotten used to its messages; users disconnecting, backup logs being created, background processes starting and finishing. But then something caught my eye- an unfamiliar message. I turned my full attention to the console and read:

&amp;#x200B;

HARDWARE FAILURE DETECTED

&amp;#x200B;

Oh. Well. That's...probably not good. But obviously the server was still alive since the console utility was still scrolling messages. And it wasn't a hard drive failure since that displayed the somewhat more helpful ""Hard drive failure detected"". I poked what I could and couldn't figure out what was wrong. So I phoned my boss.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;$me: Hey, it's $me. I'm getting hardware errors on the console.  
&gt;  
&gt;$boss: ....Ok. Well I'll take a look. I'll call you back.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, the file we were waiting for had come in but I wasn't comfortable importing it with the hardware error still scrolling across my console. I told my coworker what was going on and she decided to go home. We could deal with the file in the morning.

&amp;#x200B;

$Boss called me back and said he couldn't figure out the source of the error, either. Luckily he lived nearby and 5 minutes later he walked in the door.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;$me: Do you want me to stick around?  
&gt;  
&gt;$boss: Nah, go home. I'll figure it out.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Ok. Call me if you need me.  
&gt;  
&gt;$boss: Will do.

&amp;#x200B;

Ah, the benefits of being an hourly employee, I thought to myself as I drove home. Consequently, the remainder of this story was told to me by $boss the following morning.

&amp;#x200B;

He called our hardware vendor and they determined that one of our drive controllers had failed. Not great, but not terrible either. The secondary controller had picked up when the primary failed, just as intended. But then everything went to shit. All our hard drives suddenly dropped- the secondary controller had just failed. The vendor realized that our controllers were on an old firmware version, one that had a serious bug. The controllers were default programmed to undergo a self-test every so often. Normally this wouldn't be a problem since the secondary controller would take over until the primary rebooted itself. Only, because of the bug, the controller never came back up from the self-test. So the primary self-tested and died, and then the secondary self-tested and died. Great.

&amp;#x200B;

They managed to get one of the controllers back up in the wee hours of the morning, but the damage to the database had been done. Apparently it hadn't liked all of its drives disappearing and had suffered unrecoverable corruption. Our CIO had, by that time, also come into the office and he made the decision to declare a Disaster Recovery Event.

&amp;#x200B;

We enacted our DR plan and most of the work to switch over to our DR system was done by the time I got in the next morning. We told our users what had happened and that yes, the DR system was noticeably slower than our production system; please don't call us about it. That mostly worked. Mostly.

&amp;#x200B;

Not long after I got in $boss and CIO went home to get some well deserved rest and I was left to deal with some minor quirks of the DR system, mostly printer related (Don't we all love printers?). But the transition was largely seamless for our users, which is the true goal of any fail-over event. We were on the DR system for about a week while our failed controllers were replaced. And then, well, that was it. We switched back to our production system with no further issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty anti-climactic, I know. But isn't that a good thing with disaster events? We had a plan, we followed it, and no data was lost. And everyone lived happily ever after. Well, except for that one department: no matter which printer they printed to while we were on the DR system, the document always printed on the manager's printer. I never did figure that one out.",talesfromtechsupport

My company looks after IT for a small lobbying group in our government (I’m in the UK), and all the users (a mixture of senior representatives and supporting staff) are either of the non-techy or elderly persuasion. Or both. Mostly they are nice to deal with, but somewhat hard work due to the above.

One of the senior Ladies (capital L) was working late one night, and she called my direct number really late, like midnight late, in a panic. It was way out of hours so I don’t know why I picked up, but I did:

User - I was writing a very important speech and suddenly everything has gone down and I can’t finish it.

Me - Ok, what happened exac...

User - This is very important. I’m giving this speech in Parliament tomorrow and I must finish it tonight.

Me - Ok, what PC are you using and what application are you using? 

User - I am on my desktop PC in the office and I am using Word. I can’t access the folder where my speech is saved and email isn’t working. 

Me - (tries remote access, all PCs appear offline but it’s midnight so not entirely surprising) It appears your machine is offline, which might explain things. Has there been a power outage or something like that?

(They have no UPS, I know I know, but they refused to pay for it and it’s a small office under 10 ppl. In my defence, all their services are cloud based.)

User - No.

Me - It looks like there might be a wider problem at the office, I can’t reach any other machines there (including local storage/monitoring server and router). Can you go into the “computer cupboard” ? (their name for it)

User - I don’t want to go in there again.

Me - (again — uh oh) Errr...?

User - I was trying to concentrate on my speech and the humming noise from that bloody cupboard was distracting me, so I went in there and turned everything off. What a waste of electricity it all being on all the time is anyway.

Me - (massive hand to face slap that she must have heard over the phone) Even the ones with the labels that say “Do Not Turn Off”?

User - Yes.

Me - Ok, well that does explain the problem. The equipment you turned off provides the network and the internet for your office, both of which you need to be able to work, eg use the shared drive and send emails.

User - And?

Me - Well, if it’s all off then it can’t do that. Shall I try and take you through starting everything back up again? We need to do in a specific order to be sure it all comes back...

User - I haven’t got time for that, I need to finish my speech! 

Me - You can’t do that in the way you want to/intended to, because you’ve turned off all the necessary equipment. 

User - Send someone out now to sort this mess out!

Me - It’s midnight and you don’t have 24/7 support. (Didn’t help myself by answering this call in the first place!) I’ll schedule someone to come to you tomorrow morning.

User - But my speech...

Me - Do you still have your old printer? (USB inkjet because she “doesn’t like” the network laser)  

User - Yes.

Me - Ok, I suggest you type and then print your speech on that, and take it with you tomorrow?

(Before anyone says USB drive or whatever, she doesn’t own one and doesn’t even know what USB is, so I did not try and go there.)

User - Ok, good idea, I was going to email it to my assistant to do that, but this will have to do. (click)

t3_bvpwsu,I can't type! 'Did you plug in the keyboard?' I can't type!,"This one happened a while ago back when I was interning at a IT company, but I thought I'd share it with you guys anyways. So basically to graduate my highschool I had to do 8 weeks of internship (there is not a minimum wage, but most companies pay their interns in Austria. Albeit a laughable amount. Then again my duties consisted of sitting in an office and watching youtube videos, so I'm not in any position to complain about the pay being too low) so I was interning at that company for a month or 4 weeks. Since my school specializes in biomedical engeneering I interened at a hospital location, where they would provide tech support for the entire site. Then we get a call.

I won't insult your intelligence by telling you who is who.

Boss: OP, User in Room is having trouble with their keyboard. It's not gonna be too hard, just take a keyboard from the shelf, go there and swap it out, you know the drill.

So I went there and interrupted what seemed to be a very private talk between patient and doctor to find the keyboard that was causing trouble, which wasn't plugged in. I stared at it for a minute in disbelieve and then asked

OP: Why is this not plugged in?

User: Well I unplugged it, because it can't be THAT important and I had to copy some data from this USB-Stick and there were no free slots...

OP: are you done copying the data?

User: Yes, but the keyboard isn't working.

Still processing what just happened, I just wordlessly plugged it back in and left.

The hospital does technically have a policy against USB-Sticks because of the huge IT-safety issues they can cause, but they didn't pay me enough to listen to a rant from an old doctor 5 years from retirement about me, a lowly intern from an external company, telling him, a fucking high and mighty doctor what to do and what not to do. The USB-ban is by the way the reason it's impossible to plug anything into a PC without unplugging something.

I do feel sorry for the patient, but I'm glad to report that in the two years after this exchange the keyboard hasn't caused any issues ever again that I know of. (That was towards the end of the third week, so I was basically only there for one more week, and they don't keep me informed about what happens to that one keyboard I just so happened to plug in. I do like to think that they're still getting a decent laugh about it though...)",talesfromtechsupport
t3_bvmp62,The Email is down. A story totally not like the other one.,"At the time of this story I worked in a chase the sun support location for a large multi national financial institution. 

Onsite we had a variety of support groups who had 24/7 coverage of the institutions vital infrastructure and IT services. 

I myself worked on the America shift and was a lowly 1st/2nd level help desk op. On my shift I would say we had another 20 people in my team alone, and then there were the guys and gals working the UK/Euro shift so another 30 or so of them. We were the front line for pretty much everything that had a power cable and allowed the institution to make millions of dollars every hour.

We have good working relationships with the 3rd level support contacts and the escalation points for the specialist teams who actually deal with the real stuff beyond turning it off and on again, and resetting passwords, or teaching someone how to use excel. We still had to know stuff about things but most anything we couldn't solve would get bumped across to a specialist team.

It was an average night for us, we had calls in the queue but nothing crazy and everyone was just taking it as it came. But suddenly the queues spiked. All of them. From 2 or 3 waiting to 99 waiting. Guess how many digits the queues could display?

But because this is a modern fiance institution we also have chat channels. All the support channels for general users ping with ctrl red notifications from people in them, all with roughly the same questions.

WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO THE EMAIL?

Is your email down too?

If we can't send this email we are going to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars! Whose your manager?!?!?!!!!

So hey good news we clearly can see this is an institution wide outage. We have a procedure for this.

Priority one get the message out we are aware and looking into it.

Concurrent Priority One contact the email escalation service desk and find out if they are aware (never assume) and if so what do they know at this point?

The message out was simple, record a new message for the IVR and also update all the support channels. We had that sorted in about 5 or 6 minutes.

Contacting the email service desk was hard. They weren't answering. Given they are in the same building as us and they work the same hours it's not like they can just disappear. We already knew it wasn't network because all those chat channels were still going. They used the same infra as the email sercices did except for the actual servers but even then those were in the same data centers. 

We had to send one of the team leads down to actually go speak to the the email service desk to get some info so we can actually start telling the users something helpful. 

Good news is that before he gets back email sercices resume globally. YAY the institution is back to making millions per hour again! Woohoo! 

When he comes back it's clear he's pissed off Though. We didn't get any other info though until about 20 minutes later when everything had settled down and we cleared the queues.

What happened? Well apparently the email service desk realised it was necessary to carry out some emergency maintenance on the global exchange servers primary and backup. So they pulled the servers down and let the escalation and business contacts know they were doing it.

By sending an email......

When the global email exchange servers were down.....

When asked why they didn't answer their phones, they were in a meeting discussing the maintenance procedure steps and didn't want to be disturbed.

Color me surprised when i read the next week that we had positions available in the email service desk.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_bvmthd,"The Case Of The ""Broken"" $ThinClient!","So, I work for IT at my university, supporting a subset of the whole university. I do a mix between helpdesk and hardware work, and at the time of this story was basically Tier 1 (but we don't really have a tiering system).

&amp;#x200B;

Cast of characters:

$Potato: Me, a self-conscious humanities/ ""soft science"" student who somehow managed to land an IT job

$Scott: The head of the off campus housing center in question--I'd only ever seen his picture on the housing bulletin board, which he replaced with a stock picture of Steve Carrell as Michael Scott

$Janitor: A well-meaning janitor

&amp;#x200B;

On this story's fateful day, I found a ticket in our queue from a division of our university housing department that was off campus (we have off-campus apartment complexes that are managed by the university). Apparently, the apartment community center's lab computer, which is there mostly to access the Internet and Microsoft, was ""non-functional."" After trying to remote in, we decided an on-site visit would be best. I live in that particular apartment complex, so I figured I could head over and take a look at the end of my shift. 

Now, an important bit of background for this story--for dorm and apartment lab computers, we use a certain brand of thin clients, I'll call them $thinclients. They're cheap, and easy to replace--all departments put in a sum of money at the beginning of the year, and in exchange they get access to our stock of $thinclients. So, when one goes down, we can take another over, replace it, and troubleshoot the old one. If the old one is beyond repair, there's no cost associated with it for the department. Because of  this, I went over at the end of my shift, figuring I'd just either reconnect it to the Internet, change some settings, or just remove it and bring it into work tomorrow, and then bring a new one at the end of the day. (It was a low priority ticket, so delays weren't a big deal). 

Yeah, that wasn't the case.

I get there to find the community center lab in a state of...disrepair. The table next to it is a sort of apartment supply exchange, where you leave something and take something, and someone, presumably $Scott, had decided to use one of the large paintings from the exchange to block off the community center computer. After moving it, I discovered...just a monitor. Literally, just a monitor. No mouse, no keyboard, no $thinclient. I find $Scott milling around in the back.

&gt;Me: ""Hey, Scott, um...I'm $Potato, from IT on campus, here to look at the Community Center computer...are you, um...did you take the keyboard and mouse?  
&gt;  
&gt;$Scott: ""Nah, some of the students probably took them."" \*sigh\*   
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ""Okay, we can bring some from our stock, but, um...where's the $thinclient that isn't working?  
&gt;  
&gt;$Scott: ""Oh, in that cabinet there."" \*points to a wooden cabinet with carvings\* ""Let me see if $Janitor has the key.""

I look through the carvings, but I can just see a mess of cables, and no $thinclient. After a moment, $Janitor comes, and explains that he can't find the key. He does, however, help me jimmy it open. (*Lockpicking skill increase!)* The door swings open to reveal...a completely different model of $thinclient that I've never seen before.  After consulting with my supervisor via $Workplacemessagingapp, I learn that these were phased out completely a couple years ago, before my time--or so we thought. We hadn't supported these in literal YEARS. As such, the network port had been deactivated for the whole community center (no one was using it, and it costs money to keep them up. 

After sorting through the mess of cables, I retrieved the $ancientthinclient and did my best to explain the situation to $Scott. He gave me a couple of solutions to propose to my supervisors, and after a long time waiting for the network port to be activated and fiddling with IP settings, we managed to get the Community Center functioning. \*muted applause\*",talesfromtechsupport
t3_bvmv1r,Passive aggression,"I support healthcare software that keeps electronic medical records. My company has a number of products in the healthcare industry but my team only supports two of them.

The team I'm on has a running Skype chat going all day to chit chat and bounce questions off one another since we're broken into smaller teams that support parts of those two programs. I support interfaces. Another tech, I'll call him Dave, supports another area of the software.

A call comes in. Dave posts to our chat with what the customer is giving him for an issue which Dave doesn't understand. But it sounds like an interface issue. So, Dave requests help and I jump on.

&amp;#x200B;

Dave in chat: This guy is asking about some DMS files that he's not seeing crossing the interface. I don't know what DMS is. Me: Yeah, never heard of that. But I'll join. FYI, I have 10 minutes till I need to call a customer.

I get on the call.

Me: Hi. I understand you have an issue with an interface? I'm not sure I fully understood the issue. Would you mind summarizing for me?

Caller: I'm an interface manager for &lt;hospital&gt; and we have a DMS interface with your server which runs your company's product. That server isn't allowing connections and I'm calling to find out if there's been a change or if you want me to shut off the interface.

Me: I'm sorry but I can't say to shut it off since it's not my data.

Caller: It's your server though. You guys configured it. $install\_engineer *(a name I am not familiar with)* set it up and configured the interface. We were told not to email him directly and to call into support if we needed help.

Me: Again, I'm sorry that you were told that but we don't own servers or manage them. I don't have any access to that server. We're strictly software. The server is not ours. Though it makes sense that you were told not to contact $install\_engineer since his team just does builds and not support.

Caller: Okay. So, you don't care what happens and I'm just supposed to let this data build up and not go anywhere?

Me: I didn't say I didn't care. I want you to get the interface going again but I'm not the support for the other side. And I'm not familiar with the product, so can't say who to call.

*Dave and I have been chatting in our team chat while this conversation is taking place trying to figure out WTF this guy is talking about.*

Dave: While you guys were chatting, I found an old case for &lt;hospital&gt; and found just one case that seems to be related due to the terms being similar. I can create a case and send it to the same team. I'll include your contact information if that would be okay with you.

Caller: Yeah. I guess if that's what has to happen.

Me: Okay. It sounds like Dave has this well in hand. I've got to drop for my scheduled meeting with another customer. Dave will get this to the right team and get you taken care of.

t3_bvfrbt,Had to help a coworker CYA against a bad CYA,"Document, document, document and CYA (cover your ass!) is a common theme on this subreddit, and with good reason! Today I had to help a coworker Cover Her Ass against an either malicious or incompetent CYA from a customer. I guess this was a CHA?

I work for a SaaS vendor, and one of our clients is MegaGiantGlobalCorp. This client is, shall we say, quite difficult to handle. Their IT department is a shitshow that is peopled by Slick Willie types who constantly try to duck blame and shirk responsibility. For any problem we are immediately blamed, and when we show proof that an issue is on their end there's no accountability. But they pay us tons of money, so there's that!

I rolled into work this morning and first thing saw a message in our internal IM from a remote-based tech support coworker. Let's call her Patty. She works for us but is based full-time at MegaGiantGlobalCorp's headquarters. Patty's request was for someone to jump on a webex with her, so I did.

**Patty**: hey DeadMoneyDrew! Do you recognize this IP address in the whitelist? XX.255.XXX.3?

I didn't recognize the IP, but there was a note from a former employee of ours indicating that he had added it to the whitelist. No other details than that, though.

**Me**: Hmmm, looks like we added that IP, but I don't recognize it.  I don't think it's from our data center but I have no idea what it is. Why?

**Patty**: Slick Willie came by earlier and asked me about it. He's cleaning up the whitelist. I told him I'd look into it and let him know if it's safe to delete it.

**Me**: I'd message the network team and ask them about it. If it's not one of our IPs then it's probably safe to delete.

**Patty**: Sure, thanks. Hey, can we look at this other issue blah blah blah...

We went on to looking at something else, but then I saw a popup preview of an email from Slick Willie on Patty's screen, and I caught a few words that concerned me.

**Me**: Uhhh, Patty? Open that email that you just got from Slick Willie. 

She opened it and found more or less this:

**Slick Willie**: Patty, per our conversation, IP address XX.255.XXX.3 is not relevant, and I can delete it from the whitelist. Thanks.

**Me**: Ohhhh. If that's one of our IPs, and he deletes it from the list, it could cause an outage. Or at minimum a service degradation. Not cool.

**Patty**: let out a string of obscenities that would make Samuel L. Jackson kneel and pray. Okay, not really, but she was frustrated.

**Patty**: Ohhh, that guy! He doesn't listen and he doesn't think. I told him to WAIT until I did some research and that I'd get back to him.

She went on to say that Slick Willie was constantly pressuring her on tasks and that he was always trying to shift blame to her or to one of our other remote-based techs when things went to shit.

**Me**: Reply just to him. Tell him nicely but clearly that he misunderstood. You do NOT give permission to delete that IP from the whitelist because you don't know what it is. If he deletes it and it's critical then an outage could occur. Repeat that you'll do further research and get back to him, but that he is NOT to do anything until you say so. Then forward the email that you send to Slick Willie to the account manager and let him know what's going on.

Later I heard that the account manager called Slick Willie's boss and let the boss know that Slick Willie was possibly out and about deleting things from the production environment without first understanding what they are. I'm pretty sure that Slick Willie got an ass chewing.

t3_bvfsz7,Your emails are rude and sarcastic.,"Recent story from the past week. A bit of backstory.

My job is a small place of about 4-6 people, handling 25-30 different sites all around the state, 3000 computers, mostly small clinics that are far away from a big city that require a helpdesk at times. 

(rant)A handful of these sites are places where grown children work, every dang day its some new bullcrap in a poorly made single sentence, which requires training in reading Moron. I swear there's gotta be a book on how to speak the language of Stupid somewhere in the world, seems to be a skill you pick up.(rant over)

One particular site full of these *people* puts in a ticket on a Friday at 3pm, asking for access to Outlook, a website, and the same website just a different site (think yahoo.com and yahoo mail). Cool, easy enough. Check past tickets, this user she wants was given access months ago. I reply back in email form to let her know this person has the required access, and they should be able to just log right into these items (especially Outlook as this site has an automatic fill-out for the program, just enter the info and you're in).

This goes back and forth for a week, till the next Friday. Longer than it should have gone. Mostly trying to get information like ""What PC does this person use primarily, have they tried to get into the site or outlook?"" Somehow this was taken negatively, as this gal had felt she had given all the information I would ever need:

1. This guy is located in this section of the workplace
2. He uses just 1 PC
3. He only needs these items so that he can get a feel for them so its not vital to work

I call her up at the site, get this settled. I'm not going to get into what was said cause its kind of fuzzy at this point. All in all I have to explain:

**1. None of us know where his location is as we work remotely and need a PC name**

**2. She says he uses 1 PC, but I can search for his last name in our system showing all the PCs at every single site and it shows him logged into three computers for the entire week**

**3. If he does not have Outlook/Office installed then we can get someone down there to get that done in 20 minutes**

She *threatens* to include 2 higher up managers into each and every email in the future, which is actually preferred as it gives us more proof we called and emailed back looking for information, and has the gall to tell me my emails were rude and sarcastic and not appreciated. I apologize and thank her for the feed back as its never my intention to have my emails interpreted as rude. 

I end that call somewhat flustered, looking back through the 10 emails I sent back and forth looking for any sign of rudeness. I ask my coworker to check the inbox as we can all see each others emails as long as they have the helpdesk CC'ed, she sees no rudeness. I message the owners wife, who also works there doing different support, about a user telling me that she thought I was rude. She looks at my chain and also says there was no rudeness or sarcasm, just looking for information.

In the end, one of the onsite people got to the PC and installed Office at the PC, and the guy who uses *this one PC all the time* has never been logged back in for 2 weeks now. 

The nerve of some people.

t3_bvf0lu,Things get outta hand because user doesn't know what she needs,"LTLFTP, 

I'll try to keep this as succinct as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a team lead for a 'start up' company that supports medical centers for the east coast of the U.S. Most of the time we deal with things like their tablet doesn't have data, or they can't schedule a visit for a nurse. So we work with everyone from Medical Directors down to office staff like the clinic manager. 

Towards the end of my day yesterday, an IT manager from the client side was IM'ing me asking if i can help reset a password for an MD he was working with directly. This MD happened to be part of a new care center our client was acquiring, so their stuff isn't quite set up yet.  This is not something he typically does, he's just filling in for someone for the moment. So i said sure, and i sent him the temp password. Then he asks if he can have the user call the helpdesk to get his email set up on his phone. Again, sure thing. Call the number and anyone of my staff can help him out. 

&amp;#x200B;

So i notify my staff that an MD will be calling, but after about 10 minutes it doesn't seem like they have called in yet. Suddenly, one of my T1's is messaging me telling me to pull her call ASAP because the lady she was speaking with was a total...you know. So i pull the call. What basically ensued was the user asking for a Microsoft Office license key on their computer to be activated. This isn't something T1 has the ability to do, so the user (whom was a 'spokesperson' for the MD) got pissed off that we wouldn't help them. She hung up. OK, so i email the call to my manager so he can escalate it up to the client side. 

&amp;#x200B;

As that is happening, the user escalated it up with their AreaVP who called us back but got the wrong department. I get approached by that department head asking wtf is going on. I'm trying to explain the situation, and he transferred the call back to my helpdesk. So now my agent is talking to the AVP, my manager is talking to the client side IT manager and i'm trying to figure out what the hell is happening. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's a lot of other details involved in this but my T1 was able to help the MD (who was extremely nice) do other things he needed to do. The client side IT manager agreed that this was the initial user not understanding what she needed. I.E claiming he needed email on his phone, not his computer and that he never actually used the temp password i had provided like an hour earlier. However, a VIP from the client side somehow got involved and told us that the initial call was something we should have been able to handle and it's our fault that it got escalated. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; User doesn't know what she's asking for, gets pissed. Escalates it up. Things get out of hand and client VIP thinks it's our fault.",talesfromtechsupport

t3_bv5psj,Just forget I ever said anything,"Currently working as a hardware tech fixing printers. Have a small team on the phone that takes incoming calls where they take all the information regarding the issue, 90% of the time it is user error and can be fixed on the phone. If it is determined that a hardware repair is needed than a canned email is sent giving out our address while mentioning how much the assessment will cost. If additional parts are required then ""we will send you the full quote before the repair and the repair will be performed after quote is approved"".


Received a printer a couple of days ago. Assessed the unit, needed some rollers replaced but didn't have them in stock. Ordered stock which was due to arrive in 2 days. Customer calls the next day pleading me to get the repairs done asap. Told him I would repair and ship it out by the end of the week.


After receiving the parts I replaced the faulty rollers with new ones. Called customer telling him his printer has been fixed and will be shipped out. Also informed him that the cost of the rollers was going to be $200. Tells me he is happy it is fixed. I tell him I will the courier now so it leaves our office today. Should be delivered tomorrow. Call ends.


Manager calls 30 minutes later. Have a very good relationship with him, he works from another city. I work autonomously in my area.


&gt;Manager: Did you perform unauthorized repairs for the customer? He's not happy about this.

&gt;Me: Huh? I called him telling him the rollers would cost $200 and he didn't object.

&gt;Manager: I received a call from him. He says in the email we told him we would quote him for the parts and only perform the repairs after approval. He is unhappy we performed the repairs without his approval.

&gt;Me: Don't worry, I can fix this. I will call him now.


Called customer.


&gt;Me: I just received a call from my manager and I really apologize for going ahead with the repairs without approval. We don't generally do this but considering you needed the repairs done asap I went against company policy. My understanding is that you are declining the repair?

&gt;Customer: No not declining it. I still want the repairs done.

&gt;Me: Sorry for not understanding this. What is the problem then?

&gt;Customer: You guys said you will do an assessment, send the quote, wait for our approval then perform the repairs. I didn't appreciate it that you went ahead without my approval.

&gt;Me: No worries, this is perfectly fine. Consider we are still in the assessment stage. I will send you the quote now.

&gt;Customer: But the repairs were already done.

&gt;Me: Yes, I did change the rollers. But consider that as the assessment. Now that I have assessed new rollers will fix the problem I will remove the new rollers, install your faulty rollers back. Cancel the courier pickup scheduled and then send you the quote. Once you approve the quote I will then open the printer back, install the new rollers and ship the printer back. Repairs will take within the 5 days after the quote's approval as per company policy. Your new quote will increase the cost for you as well as the numbers of hours worked is also going up. Initially you were only paying the assessment fee + parts. Now you will be paying assessment + parts + labor.

&gt;Customer: Dont. Why would you do that?

&gt;Me: I thought that is what you wanted. To be sent the quote before the repair? I will be sending you the quote now as per company policy.

&gt;Customer: Just forget I ever said anything. Don't do anything different, do as you were originally going to do. 

&gt;Me: You don't want the quote?

&gt;Customer: No.

t3_bv9c8s,User wants VTO after calling help desk 3 hours into shift,"This story isn't necessarily 100% tech support related, but I got this call while I was a temp for a tier 1 help desk for a retail company.  Feel free to remove if you don't think it belongs mods.

Pretty much just involves $Me and $Lady.  I probably spent about 20 minutes on the phone with her.  There will be some paraphrasing, this happened back in early december.  Also all of the calls we took were recorded.

$Me: Thank you for calling help desk, how can I help you?

$Lady: Hi, yes, I live in an apt complex and the fire alarms started going off about 3 hours ago and we were forced to evacuate.  Can I get troubleshoot time or VTO from you?

For context on the policy for this job.  We were allowed to give any user 1 hour of paid troubleshoot time if they have issues, whether it's a technical issue or not.  After that, if they weren't going to be able fix their issue within that time (Generally hardware issues where they needed new equipment or something) they would need to call back and request 1 hour VTO from us.  But that's all we can give anyone.  After that they have to call the VTO desk to request further time off.

Next thing I noticed while on the phone with her is, I hear absolutely nothing going on in the back ground on the phone.  Not saying she is lying about the fire alarm, but the fact I hear nothing besides her is fishy.

$Me:  I'm sorry, I won't be able to give you any time off, you're already out 3 hours from your start time, you'll need to contact your supervisor and VTO desk to request time off.

$Lady:  Why can't you just give me the small amount of time!?  I wasn't able to call you sooner because I don't personally have a cellphone!  I was only just now able to borrow a phone from someone!

$Me: I'm sorry that you weren't able to contact me until just now, but since you specifically stated that you've been out for 3 hours, I'm unable to help you in this regard.

$Lady: \*Getting quite upset\* Just give me the time!

This went back and forth for some time all the while she is getting more and more upset.  She eventually hangs up on me because I won't help her.  I proceed to forward the ticket number to my supervisor with all the details of said conversation.  Who in turn, reports it to her supervisor.

I'm unsure as to what happened with her, but I would assume it was less than good for her.

t3_bux0xk,Wi-Fi and cats: natural enemies.,"I wrote this as a comment somewhere else, but thought it was a good idea to do the extended version here.

&amp;#x200B;

Years ago, when I was living in Mexico City, found myself short on money and with no good jobs in the near future, so I did what most young people do for a quick buck: I went to work in a call center. Since I was fluent enough in english, got enrolled into Internet Services Support for AT&amp;T. 

We had to manage calls in english and spanish, but per contract we were Tier 1 support only, which means we couldn't help beyond what was in our scope, otherwise we had to escalate to Tier 2. I grew up a little frustrated from time because I knew the solution to most issues but couldn't do shit about them (years later I understood it has to do with liability). 

So there I was one afternoon, things were going smoothly and I get a call from a very kind middle-aged lady that had problems with her Wi-Fi, apparently she wasn't getting any signal from it. I followed the script, checked the basics, did the remote diagnostics and everything, all while chit chatting with her. I found out the modem was defective and resetting by itself every few minutes, so I scheduled a visit from the technician to replace it. I let her know the diagnostic and that a technician was going to her place later.

&amp;#x200B;

U$ER: Oh my, do you think I'll be without internet for a long time?

Me: Don't worry, I'll try to set it up as soon as possible so you don't have to worry about it.

U$ER: Thank you. Now that I recall, the cat was around the modem yesterday.

Me: (Thinking to myself, hope the cat didn't trip on the modem or something) I see, maam. Do you think he tripped over the cables?

U$ER: No, no, it wasn't that. It's just, you know, cats can see things we cannot, right?

Me: I suppose.

U$ER: I'm thinking he might have seen the Wi-Fi signal and stole it. Cats tend to be that playful, maybe he misplaced it.

Me: ...yeah... (me trying to understand what the hell I just heard and not to laugh) You know, cats!

U$ER: Can't live without them!

&amp;#x200B;

She was nice enough I didn't want to contradict her or anything, but I had to take a little break after the call to laugh out loud. Of course, had to make sure there was no cats around. You never know what they might steal.",talesfromtechsupport
t3_buw39p,Can't you connect remotely an enable it?,"Years ago, while working a tech support got a situation which still till this day makes me laugh.

We had support from managers and their laptops, to production machines connected to on intranet workstations and entry/exit security guys and their systems, and more, and all this in different countries.

&amp;#x200B;

One such story is about the entry\\exist PC, which was using a shared username, usually always getting locked out when shifts changes, i think it was monday morning, few hours before the regular 9to5 people would come to work, so we had time to fix it. Anything big that couldn't be fixed remotely would be taken care by regional on site teams.

&amp;#x200B;

Got a call from one such gate(they were kinda all linked, so if 1 goes down, all go down), so this story got $ME, a Security Guy($SG), and Karen from On Site support($KOS).

&amp;#x200B;

\*ring\* \*ring\*

$ME: Hi, my name is...\[interrupted\]

$SG: Hey dude(i was on weekend shift, so was he, we talked before so he knew i was in that early and that i was going to answer), we have a problem with this $pass \[i interrupt him this time\]

$ME: Hey man, got it got it, also you know we shouldn't know passwords, please, pleeeeeease say $username and not $password when you call, it's recorded.

$SG: Sorry tired, couple hours left and this happened.

$ME: unlocked it, call it in.

$SG: hold on, (he puts phone aside, get's on the walkey and contacts other stations), $pass.. I MEAN $USERNAME IS WORKING, confirm all stations, (loud static noises and couple voices confirm it works, picks up phone and continues conversation with $ME), ok, so it's confirmed, thanks buddy

$ME(cause i guess i was a bit too pro-active say): i heard everyone confirming except you

$SG: ah right, let me check... \[FEW MOMENTS LATER\] Oh it's not working for me, weird 

&amp;#x200B;

So we go back and forth with \[insert basic troubleshooting here\] and at this point i make him describe with own words everything, every pixel on the monitor, lucky for both of us he starts from right corner describing all the icons near the watch, now, not sure if i was tired or the way he described it, but I almost missed it then say:

&amp;#x200B;

$ME: Wait, boxes? what boxes?

$SG: yeah, 2 boxes with a red x

$ME: do they look more like monitors rather then boxes?

$SG: you might be right, now at closer look, yes, is that bad?

$ME: well yes, means you don't have network on it

&amp;#x200B;

So we go on testing, from ""have you tried turning it off and on again"" to more advanced network adapters check and figure out network cards are disabled, quickly realize no admin rights on the $pass... i mean $account, so gotta involve On Site team so looks up who's on call and of course it is Karen. I tell $SG, he says a reassuring ""oh NO!"" and wishes me good luck. So i call On Site on call and it goes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

$ME: Hi, morning, sorry to disturb, we got an issue with...\[interrupted\]

$KOS: What did you do again? (she just hated me, so blames everything on me, but that's a whole other story)

$ME: One of the entry systems got the network card disabled.

$KOS: SO?

$ME: (wishing to say ""all the info is in that sentence, you should know this"", continue patiently biting my own lip): well the $username used doesn't have admin rights so cannot enable it.

$KOS: SO?

$ME: Someone needs to enable it locally.

$KOS: give them the local admin and... \[i interrupt $KOS\]

$ME: would do so, but due to security reasons and policy and because they might misuse for other purposes, can't do that.

$KOS: \[discussed ""uhm"" followed by\] great, now i have to drive an hour to get there.

$ME: truly sorry, would help if i could.

$KOS: Sure, you can shove your sorry ... (she stops talking) ... Ok, send me the details on my phone.

\*click\* (she hung up)

&amp;#x200B;

So i start creating the case number, gather and prepare the date to send to $KOS, almost clicked ""Send"" button when phone rings.

&amp;#x200B;

\*ring\* ring\*

$ME: hi, i'm...\[interrupted\]

$KOS: you moron, you woke me up for this?

$ME confused, it was 3 minutes later at best, and wondering how she got there that fast: I'm sorry?

$KOS: I knew you were incompetent but this takes the cake(expression might be lost in translation).

$ME: Sorry again, if you could tell me what to do, i will do it, i want to help,an sorry for disturbing you so early.

$KOS: well... \*starts actually yelling\* HAVE YOU TRIED CONNECT REMOTELY AND ENABLE IT? YOU ARE AFTER ALL ADMIN... GEEZ... SUCH INCOMPETENCE...

We picks up a ticket for a loaner laptop because the user left their laptop in their manager's 'office' the day before and now it's gone. He talks to her and it comes out she thinks she left it there but can't guarantee.

OK, we get her the loaner, she's retiring tomorrow anyway, it will be IT security's issue at that time.

Next day comes around and coworker is out sick. I pick up a ticket for same lady, she got her laptop back but has a weird error I've not seen before. Call her up and go down to her desk (she returned the loaner day before due to scheduling of it).

Error is gone (she closed it, because user). I start working on it, cannot get network. So I remove the drivers thinking that's it. Reboot and nothing.

Move to another desk / dock after trying direct network cable to the laptop, still no connections.

Finally call up security and they're like ""oh yeah, we we quaranteened her because she lost it."" I've now since looked around and talked to various co-workers and no one knows how security found out.

So I have to take her laptop back to my desk after they remove her from quaranteen so I can download drivers on my computer, put them on a thumb drive (we block for the most part anyone putting data on external drives in anyway), put them on her computer, and get her NIC back online. 

As I'm gathering things up her manager shows up and says, 'Karen, we were supposed to meet 5 mintues ago, are you coming?'

Her response, 'oh, $me is going to get my laptop working again.' 

Her manager says, ""Oh, the one you 'lost' in your friend's trunk because you were drunk and couldnt remember where you out it?"" 


That was unfortunately a good 3 hours of my, my co-worker's, and securities time on an otherwise glorious Thursday.

t3_builfu,Production Outages only... yeah right.,"Many many years ago, I used to have an IT job at a manufacturing plant that ran 24/7. Unfortunately, the IT dept didn't have 24/7 staff coverage, so one person each week was on call during the nights and weekends. We had to carry a pager. It was supposed to be for **production outages** only. 

One weekend, I was busy doing yard work and the pager goes off. I call the user and he starts telling me about a printer that doesn't work. I ask if he can use another one on the network, and he starts asking me if I can send someone in to fix it. I then ask him how is this printer preventing production. He says ""you aren't going to help me, are you?"" I tell him no and hang up. I made a note of the printer and had the helpdesk fix it the following Monday. 

My boss had a talk with the user's supervisor the following Monday about what constitutes a **production outage** and when to call the pager.

Eventually, years later the brain dead upper management approved to have 24/7 helpdesk coverage and we no longer had to carry the pager.",talesfromtechsupport

It was a quiet day in the office. Not so quiet outside. Pretty much no one is calling IT right now because the entire office is glued to the windows waiting for Dorothy's house to fly by. It is raining sideways and the wind is howling and the lightning is right on top of us. I am like the rest of our employees glued to the window watching the storm. All of a sudden the whole world lights up and lightning comes down right across the street and hits the little box where all the telecom is for our street.
